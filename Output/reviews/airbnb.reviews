Version 3.2.1 2014-17-02 4
 (Timeouts after a short period of time) Please increase the timeout or let users choose that time limit. Alternatively have a 'history' or a 'recently looked at' section where we can see what we were looking at before the app timed us out.

Version 3.2.1 2014-17-02 4
 (Airbnb is Very Good) App is continuously being updated and in the year I have been hosting my properties I use the mobile app the most and it has been very good. Once in a while it will have its glitches and bugs but that is common to any travel app. I highly recommend. 
Thanks airbnb.

Version 3.2.1 2014-17-02 1
 (Broken) Airbnb's software is terrible, and the current version of the iPhone app is no different. As of this writing, I can't add a location while listing an apartment, which means I CAN'T LIST AN APARTMENT. Are you kidding me? The single most important thing in their app is broken. Thanks Airbnb!

Version 3.2.1 2014-17-02 5
 (Great app for awesome service) Traveled cross country staying with airbnb hosts and the app allowed me to keep in contact with hosts, make additional bookings and leave reviews. Very useful, but would like to be able to cancel reservation from app.

 (Mrs.) We had a wonderful experience at the ARThouse in Grand Rapids, Ohio through airbnb.com. 
We rented the house on the river ( the Maumee) which was filled with art of all kinds....paintings, handmade furniture, glassworks which made the home so bright and fun! The Host, Sara Weaver, was so accommodating and made us feel right at home. She really went the extra mile to make our weekend romantic and extra- special! 
The home itself was most inviting ....it has 3 bedrooms ( the master bedroom was especially well-appointed!) the living room area had a gas fireplace and paintings on every wall, like an art gallery! One of our favorite rooms was the large sunroom overlooking the Maumee River. We even saw Bald Eagles both of the days that we stayed! The kitchen had everything we could have desired and more! Sara left a few very nice surprises! She was truly " the Hostess with the Mostess!" I am thankful that we found this gem on the airbnb.com website. I highly recommend this vacation getaway to anyone who is traveling in Northeastern Ohio.

 (You should do better) I've been an Airbnb host for 4 years and their mobile apps have NEVER been up to snuff. I respond to an inquiry on my iPad and yet it shows as an active inquiry on my iPhone. The best version is still the desktop version. Airbnb, with the money you're raking in, you should do better for the people making you rich. I used to admire your internet saavy and now it's just 'meh'.

Version 3.2.1 2014-16-02 1
 (Horrible) Wow slow and lame, get it fixed ASAP

Version 3.2.1 2014-16-02 1
 (App won't open after download) It won't open!!

Version 3.2.0 2014-15-02 1
 (Truly awful) This is a truly terrible mobile experience. I'm a product manager at a mobile startup and this is one of the worst experiences I've seen. The UI is confusing and doesn't work. Messages disappear and reappear later. It's pretty much unusable. You guys have raised enough money to give us a useable app.

Version 3.2.1 2014-15-02 1
 (Autoposts on fb without permission) Seriously guys?  Do you need to spam me?

Version 3.2.1 2014-15-02 3
 (Crashes!) Nice but it crashes! I tried several times to verify my profile by taking a picture of my driver license within the app and it crashed every time. I finally took the picture first and then up loaded it using the app and it worked. Looks like there are still a few bugs to be worked out.

Version 3.2.1 2014-14-02 5
 (I'll never book another hotel) This app is the only app I'll ever use to book another place to stay next time I travel. Excellent experience everywhere I've stayed. The app is easy to use and fun to browse!

Version 3.2.1 2014-13-02 1
 (Website) I just downloaded the app for iPhone. But I've been using the online website. Terrible database, not user friendly, difficult to try and get back to something you saw previously, 
And the founders are sitting in their dr. Strangelove conference room laughing .

Version 3.2.1 2014-13-02 2
 (Won't let me add location) It's a nice app but it won't let me use the location feature when I try and list my room for rent. Once they fix this I would rate the app higher.

Version 3.2.0 2014-13-02 3
 (Buggy App, Improving Functionality, No iPad version?!) I find this app extremely annoying to use. Developers have made good improvements with each iteration, but overall still pretty clunky to use. Some messages don't actually make it to my guests. Not good! Also, get an ipad app already!!!!!!!

Version 3.2.1 2014-13-02 4
 (Wonderful app but inconsistent with website) This app is wonderful and the layout is modern and clean. The only thing I noticed was that the total sum you inquire about is different in the messages on the app vs the messages when using the website. I think it's because the app doesn't take into account the fees. Also the app does not show fees when viewing listings.

Version 3.2.1 2014-13-02 2
 (Crashes) App would be better if it didn't crash every few minutes

Version 3.2.1 2014-12-02 2
 (App crashes every few minutes) It's a beautiful app, great user interface, and lots of helpful features, but it crashes on me every few minutes. Very frustrating, especially in the middle of a search for listings.  If the crashes stopped, I'd rate 4 stars. Still has limited functionality compared to an online search but it's not bad.

Version 3.1.0 2014-12-02 4
 (Overall not bad) It's a good mobile app. The only problem I have is that it keeps crashing when I look at the map. Please fix :)

Version 3.2.0 2014-12-02 5
 (Amazing App) This app is perfect for anyone who wants to have the privacy of a home or an apt to stay versus a hotel. For people who are respectful to others people property only. It's on a referral basis and you will only get accepted if you receive good feedback from the people hosting you in their home. It's also great for people looking to couch surf or couples who want to stay in exotic locations. Super cool app!

Version 3.2.1 2014-12-02 5
 (App is PERFECT so is Airbnb) Easy to use, keep up the good work

Version 3.2.0 2014-11-02 4
 (iPad optimized) Great app.  Would be nice to be iPad optimized too for horizontal viewing.  Just easier to see and interact with.

Version 3.2.0 2014-11-02 5
 (Love it!) This app is the best! We have used it to plan our trips to San Francisco, Tahoe, mammoth, and throughout Europe! You can rent entire apartments, condos, cabins, or homes for cheaper than hotels! Highly recommend it for anyone who does any traveling at all!!

Version 3.2.0 2014-11-02 5
 (Amazing picture) while watching the picture you will surelly plan for a holiday.the intercation so easy that u can easily book the place you want to go for holiday

Version 3.2.0 2014-10-02 5
 (Great service and beautiful app) Great service and beautiful app

Version 3.1.0 2014-10-02 2
 (Update for iPhone is awful) As a host why is the font on writing a message so small?

Version 3.2.0 2014-09-02 3
 (Ok, but has some issues) I have found properties on their website, but they don't appear on their mobile app. Also, it doesn't update deleted messages, and doesn't allow you to delete them on this app either. In addition to those, I have found that prices change between the mobile app and their website. Double check this!

Version 3.2.0 2014-08-02 3
 (Why won't the badge go away?) Decent app that integrates well with an Airbnb account. I'd rate it higher if the darn badge would go away after I respond to an inquiry.

Version 3.2.0 2014-08-02 5
 (Great app) Very easy to use, I recommend for any one.

Version 3.2.0 2014-08-02 5
 (Love it!) I suffer from the travel bug, and let me tell you, it will never be the same again! Forget conventional hotels, download this app, and envision your perfect vacation spot!

Version 3.2.0 2014-06-02 4
 (Slick and easy to use w/ one annoying issue) The app is visually pleasing, slick, easy to use, and does what I need.  But!  After you read a message on the app, the notification badge on the app icon will NOT change until you read the same message on your PC.  A small annoyance, but still an annoyance.

Version 3.2.0 2014-06-02 1
 (Had to enter cc 5 times, no cancellation possible, and they don't answer the phones) Are these guys from the "cool 70's"? When you call them, you are on hold forever, while they play short clips of music played by their cool employees, and the announcer let's you know where to hear more of their amazing creations. That, of course, is not my main concern at 9:30PM, when I am trying to cancel a pending reservation for tonight so I can get a normal hotel room, but neither the iPhone app, nor the mobile site and not even the full site exhibit ANY link to cancellations, and I have heard all their creative musicians 10 times, but nobody bothers to pick up the phone.

Version 3.2.0 2014-05-02 5
 (Love this!) Changing the way we travel.

Version 3.1.0 2014-05-02 5
 (Very Cool!!!) I love this App! It has never crashed on me. I love the search option. And the Discovery is fun to look at when I get bored. I haven't used it to book anything yet since we really don't travel. But I would definitely use it if we ever do!!!

Version 3.2.0 2014-05-02 1
 (Pretty, but useless.) The app is fine if you need to send a message to guest but anything worthwhile/important needs to be done on a computer.

Version 3.1.0 2014-04-02 5
 (ios version is cool) The design is intuitive and sweet. Luv it!

Version 3.2.0 2014-02-02 5
 (Easy to use) Filters make this app a useful tool. It is intuitive and quickly will become one of your favorite tools for finding places to stay while traveling.

Version 3.2.0 2014-01-02 5
 (Simply great) Used the Service several Times without any issues - well done!

Version 3.1.0 2014-01-02 4
 (Great But Still Far From Perfect) For any traveler the airbnb app is simply perfect but for us hosts there are still a few tweaks that should be made

For starters I wish that old messages that i delete from the website itself also disappear instead of sitting there for months end. Second of all for travelers asking for special deals I wish I could see how much they're being charged along with the date and number of guests. Finally much like the website I wish I could click on booked dates in the calander to see who's coming that day

Version 3.2.0 2014-01-02 5
 (Make the world a better place) I will buy their stock if they do ipo! Enough said.

Version 3.2.0 2014-01-02 5
 (Great for finding you a place) One of my top apps for traveling, I really love it and I use it any chance I get when I travel must-have if you're looking for place to stay

Version 3.2.0 2014-31-01 2
 (Lovely design but needs works) While it is pretty to use, the flexibility of this app leaves much to be desired. It is probably best for those wishing to book last-minute vacations how ever that is this far as it goes. 
If you happen to be someone who manages a listing, you basically need to use your computer to do this as it is impossible to do much more on any device.

Version 3.2.0 2014-31-01 5
 (Great app) Great app, great design and intuitive transition of images and screens. Live to explore and scroll thru it 😀

Version 3.2.0 2014-30-01 2
 (Barely useable) Just crashes after 5 minutes and you have to search again from scratch. Bah.

Version 3.2.0 2014-30-01 5
 (Slick and Beautiful and Intuitive) This app is just great to look at. The size of listings and their pictures is perfect. The navigation is supremely intuitive and the interface is fast and slick. I have not used this yet to book, but this app will make that process easy.

Version 3.1.0 2014-30-01 5
 (best) 정말 최고다. 웹에 비해 기능이 제한적인 걸 제외하고, 에어비앤비는 서비스 뿐만 아니라 앱자체도 매우 훌륭

Version 3.2.0 2014-30-01 3
 (So kewt) This version is so silly and sooooo kewt. Hugs & kisses.

Version 3.1.0 2014-29-01 4
 (Airbnb: A journey around the world) I love Airbnb. I've been using it for several years now, and serves as a decider on not just where to stay, but helps me decide  where to go in the world at an affordable price. It's an alternative to hotels (that lure you into staying on their grounds to spend money and waste time staring at the people in the pool) and tourists. Through airbnb I have been able to  immerse myself in the language and culture of many countries. I have interacted with locals. I love it!

Version 3.1.0 2014-29-01 5
 (Airbnb) Why would you ever stay in a hotel, omg!

Version 3.1.0 2014-27-01 5
 (Davew) Awesome alternative to hotels. Cheaper too:)

Version 3.1.0 2014-26-01 4
 (Amazing UI) Downloaded this application, and I was immediately impressed. The way the application moves and reacts enables a rich user experience. So glad I can start using this application to start planning my trip to Hawaii!

Version 3.1.0 2014-26-01 5
 (so fresh and so clean clean) Airbnb's app reminds me of that Outkast song "so fresh and so clean" because this app is just perfection...very crisp, very intuitive, easy to use. Does not get much better than this. I would like to see picture upload capabilities, however.

Version 3.1.0 2014-25-01 1
 (Latest update crashes) I have an iPhone 4 and the latest update crashes every time I open it. Can do anything with it. It's rubbish. Please rectify the update ASAP.

Version 3.1.0 2014-25-01 2
 (App potential not realized) Love the potential of Airbnb as a new host. However the app has been buggy, leaving up notifications even after I've checked them. 
Worse, I am not able to manage my listings from the app (besides changing the calendar). I would like to be able to edit a listing and add pictures to existing listings from the app. Has a ways to go before it is really useful.

Version 3.1.0 2014-24-01 5
 (Love the app) Super easy to navigate and very good lay out. The photos are great and the listings are all cool to look through. Great app. Keep it up.

Version 3.1.0 2014-23-01 5
 (Amazing app) It is really amazing app

Version 3.1.0 2014-22-01 1
 (Right hand does not know what left hand is doing) Does not take debit cards....I have emailed with hosts...picked apace...dates all set, now it won't let me book...I have never had any problems with my business card....except here...and the best part....there is NO number to call for help...everything is email...I already called my bank as per their FAQ, no issues on my end....I get a generated email sayings have to wait 72hrs to get a solution from them....how!?!?   If everything books up, how am I going to plan my trip, what kind of business can't process payments!?!?

Version 3.1.0 2014-22-01 4
 (Great app but need iPad support) Please issue an iPad-friendly version, such as horizontal support.

Version 3.1.0 2014-22-01 5
 (Perfectly executed app...) I use airbnb all the time. The app is so well made though. I love it.

Version 3.1.0 2014-22-01 5
 (Great app, great customer service, great company) Very happy with Airbnb!

Version 3.1.0 2014-21-01 5
 (Friendship makes the world a happy place) AirBnB is great!

Version 3.1.0 2014-20-01 5
 (A+) Great app from a great company

Version 3.1.0 2014-20-01 5
 (Awesome) Cheapeast way to travel and experience the local scene.

Version 3.1.0 2014-20-01 5
 (Traveling will never be the same again!) We LOVE airbnb!! You obviously have to make sure you and your potential host are compatible, but the experience you have during travels cannot be rivaled when you find the right people to stay with. We have made new connections all over the world. They are no longer just our hosts, but family.

Version 3.1.0 2014-19-01 5
 (Love it!) I've used this app a few times to book. I love it. I find it user friendly, and attractive. It has a few bugs, as with anything. But I'll take the good with bad because the concept is brilliant!! Love AirBNB!! Will always go here first when booking travel!! :)

Version 3.1.0 2014-18-01 5
 (The present and future of travel) My favorite way to travel -period.

Version 3.0.2 2014-18-01 5
 (Simple) It's the best travel app out there!

Version 3.1.0 2014-17-01 1
 (Please Fix This App) The app requires you to accept or deny every inquiry (not just booking requests), with no option to just respond/request more info on your phone (even if you've already responded on your computer!!!) or else it remains in your priority inbox for all of eternity (complete with an annoying badge app icon!). This means it is often necessary to respond to each guest twice. 

If there are two guests shown at the top of Host Home (i.e. departing today/arriving today), then the text from the two images will be written over each other, making it illegible.

Version 3.1.0 2014-17-01 5
 (Just love it!) Love it!

Version 3.0.2 2014-17-01 4
 (Love Airbnb!) Overall as a host the updated app is amazing. It's functional, aesthetically pleasing and ultimately makes being a host via cell phone that much easier. I haven't experienced any major bugs or random shutdowns. However there are a few things that make it not so navigation friendly. In example: viewing your calendar, viewing your own profile. A suggestion would be getting updates/reminder alerts that your next guests check in 24 hours in advanced would be a bonus for the next version. Overall really no complaints, love this app and more importantly love airbnb!

Version 3.1.0 2014-17-01 5
 (Beautiful) AirBnB looks and works beautifully!

Version 3.1.0 2014-16-01 2
 (Please make an iPad version) Please make an iPad version.

Version 3.1.0 2014-15-01 1
 (Yikeso!) The new app is an awful cumbersome slow-to-load buggy mess. Bring back the old app pretty please!!!

Version 3.1.0 2014-15-01 5
 (AirBNB has changed my life) I am a single, unmarried woman, who went to college and graduate school and traveled the world. When I graduated, the economy collapsed. I struggled for 4 years until I discovered AirBNB. I made 4k in bookings the first year. The second year hosting was a full year, let's just say I made over 15k. I highly Recommend it if you are a person that can get along with others. The app is great, the customer service is better than most companies I work with on a regular basis. Just great things to say. This is more than a startup, it's here to stay. Thank you to all the staff. Mahalo and Aloha from Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii

Version 3.1.0 2014-15-01 2
 (Date selection) The date selection only work for the next month or so. What if I want to select arrival date 4 mons out? Air bnb is awesome but this app isn't, yet...

Version 3.1.0 2014-15-01 5
 (Money, stress, and time saved) Absolutely recommend this app and website. Great service and better than a hostel or couch surfing in every way except money.

Version 3.1.0 2014-14-01 5
 (Love It!) Easy, accessible..booked, communicated, stayed and reviewed all on your app. Will use again and again

Version 3.1.0 2014-14-01 2
 (We love AirBnb, but...) the iPhone app has a LOT of bugs that make it quite difficult to use. Old inquiries stay on the home screen; notifications for new messages come in but upon opening the inbox, we are unable to see them. This makes it difficult to correspond with prospective guests when we're away from the computer. Edits to our listing don't always appear, and the app takes quite a while to reflect our up to date info. Not sure if that's the same for our guests-
We're looking forward to the next iteration of this app - we love AirBnb and ease of mobile use would help us greatly! It would be nice to have the ability to update the Guidebook feature using this app as well.

Version 3.1.0 2014-14-01 5
 (AirBnB is a great way to pay it forward) This app and ideal isa great way to help the next person learn bout others. To open your home/place for others to have a clean place to relax and take in the area with your help of the place to see or go. Love it, can't wait to get back to traveling now

Version 3.1.0 2014-13-01 5
 (I'll never stay in a Hotel again...) I'll travel the world only using this app if it's possible. 

AE

Version 3.1.0 2014-11-01 4
 (Awesome!) Yup, awesome!

Version 3.1.0 2014-11-01 1
 (Inaccurate alerts) I just recently became a host on AirBnB and this iPhone app is confusing. Like another reviewer said, the messages disappear or don't update and it continues to show an alert despite you having already read the message. 

Very random and confusing.

Version 3.0.2 2014-11-01 1
 (Great company terrible app!) This update is really bad. I have been using airbnb for 4 years both as a host and guest and love it, but this new interface has been moved around in an arbitrary way, has made it harder to navigate as a host, crashes constantly and doesn't put current messages at the top. Please please go back to where it was or give us access to a retroactive downgrade.  

Thanks Airbnb!

Version 3.1.0 2014-10-01 2
 (crashing) Beautiful, efficient site but after last update randomly crashes on me.  Will have to use non-mobile site until fixed.  Using ipad mini...

Version 3.1.0 2014-10-01 5
 (Life changer) This app has changed my life - traveling has never been better or cheaper.

Version 3.0.0 2014-10-01 5
 (Great app!) Saved me so much money on my vacation, and turned out to be a much better experience than if I had stayed in a hotel. Now I'm just waiting for an iPad app.

Version 3.1.0 2014-08-01 5
 (Love Airbnb) I wish more people would travel this way. I love traveling as if I were a local. Getting to stay in actual neighborhoods is THE BEST way to experience an area. Hotels are always in someplace like "Times Square". I love getting to meet people living in different countries it always feels like I'm staying with friends.

Version 3.1.0 2014-07-01 5
 (Absolutely essential travel app!) Why pay for a hotel when you can stay in a fully equipped home for half the cost? The places to stay are  great and the hosts I have met have been excellent.

Version 3.1.0 2014-07-01 5
 (Makes travel super simple) Airbnb is a fantastic concept, and the apps - on iPhone and iPad - are great. Love the new layout displaying beautiful listings from around the world, while keeping the process of searching and booking with hosts straightforward and efficient.

Version 3.1.0 2014-07-01 1
 (Help this app) I love airbnb but the new app is quite useless as a host and for searching for locations to rent.

Version 3.1.0 2014-06-01 5
 (Save $$$$) Great service!  EZ app to use. This is perfect for either the person who would use a hotel only for the bed/sleep, and doesn't need hotel facilities. When on vacation, I'm typically on the go and out the door early am, and back late night. Too much to do. Hotels seemed a waste of money. This is the perfect solution!! Saved lots of $$$.

Version 2.6.3 2014-06-01 5
 (Beautiful layout) Wonderful flow. This is a hip n' happenin' lil app.

Version 3.1.0 2014-06-01 5
 (Amazing) I love this service

Version 3.1.0 2014-06-01 3
 (Kool but keeps crashing) Great app. Nicely put together but crashes every 5-10 mins.

Version 3.1.0 2014-05-01 5
 (so helpful, it's crazy awesome) this app has been a lifesaver for our move across country. it's accurate and fast. READ the reviews, that's what makes this work!

Version 3.1.0 2014-05-01 2
 (Disappointing) The phone app is not user friendly and occasionally freeze.  I am surprised by the low level of functionality.

Version 3.0.1 2014-05-01 3
 (Needs pet filter) Would like to filter out those who accept pets.  Travel with dog, and need this feature to save search time.

Version 3.1.0 2014-05-01 5
 (Perfect way for booking) The iPhone version is completely useful for booking, you will get all the information that you need for rooms and their owners, you can book, pay and contact the host, all inside the app!

Version 3.1.0 2014-05-01 1
 (Search crash!) Everytime that I search apartments the app crashes and I loose all the search. Which makes it impossible to search.

Version 3.1.0 2014-04-01 5
 (Love) Download this app now.  We only use airbnb when we travel now!!

Version 3.1.0 2014-04-01 1
 (Why change something that worked?) I much prefer the old iPhone app. This one isn't as flexible as the old. To update your calendar you have to click on a date, un-click and then press save. Annoying! The two separate inboxes is annoying too. I want to click in one box and have everything right there. Basic, simple and to the point. Too much fancy scrolling and this and that. Why?? Makes me not want to use it all together.

Also I don't like changes they made with the website. The searching for listings has become annoying. It seems much harder to find what I need. Change it back please!!

Version 3.1.0 2014-04-01 4
 (good) Only did an AirBnB once (through my laptop), but just looking at pictures of cool houses is one of my favorite things to do.

Version 3.0.2 2014-03-01 4
 (Cool) U guys r cool thnx for the best app. The only thing missing is prise from low to high

Version 3.1.0 2014-02-01 5
 (Love this app) It is easy to use and works wonders for the traveler at heart

Version 3.1.0 2014-02-01 5
 (Great) 👍

Version 3.1.0 2014-02-01 3
 (App and desktop not up to date with one another) I booked through the app and received a reply from the host that the listing was removed from the web version.  The prices on the app are also different from what I saw on the desktop version.

Version 3.1.0 2014-01-01 5
 (Slick design) So far this has enhanced the mobile experienced of an already great service

Version 3.1.0 2014-01-01 1
 (Ipad app) I have this app on my iPad and it is awful. Used to work really well, then it was updated. Now it is awful. I'm deleting it and will rely on the website.

Version 3.1.0 2013-31-12 5
 (So cool!) This concept alone I people renting spaces to travelers is awesome! The app is hand too!

Version 3.1.0 2013-30-12 2
 (I love airbnb but not this app...) You can start a reservation like on the website. But not cancel it... 
This feature has to be on the mobile app. You don't always have a computer especially when you travel... And the host don't answer back. 

Plus no logout... Really !?

Version 3.1.0 2013-30-12 1
 (poorly designed from perspective of host) the app is poorly designed if you’re using it as an Airbnb host. messages go missing from the inbox and the little blue numbers that appear on the icon don’t seem to correspond with new messages or alerts. for instance, it often appears that you have an alert or new messages from the main screen, but when you go to “Host Home” nothing shows up and the inbox has no new messages. it makes you feel like you are missing something when the little blue numbers keep popping up… but what?! in general the app is ok in a pinch, but we rely on the Airbnb website for most transactions.

Version 3.1.0 2013-30-12 5
 (Gotta have it) One of my top biz apps

Version 3.1.0 2013-29-12 1
 (Airbnb is boring. LoveRoom is cooler) Ugh! Airbnb is cool but it's just boring. Don't get me wrong, I used it a bunch of times but I want to meet PEOPLE - not apartments. I like that new idea LoveRoom much better. I met my bf on it.

Version 3.1.0 2013-28-12 1
 (Crap) The system does not work. Hosts are liars. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME

Version 3.1.0 2013-28-12 5
 (From Surf Town to Hearts of Cities, Airbnb is a Winner!) I love AirBNB. I use it frequently to become instantly immersed into a culture or place. I've found fantastic values and locations. Don't hesitate to try it!

However, there's a bug in the current version of the app. When you try to change credit card info, it quickly retracts the card company selector and then won't let you fill out any other card info, preventing you from booking if you need to enter a different card. :(

Version 3.1.0 2013-28-12 2
 (Pretty interface but many functions don't work) Can't upload profile photo despite functionality offering this 

No save button on term changes

Version 3.1.0 2013-28-12 1
 (3.0.2 is horrible... old version is better) wish i can give this new version zero stars. interface is hard to navigate, home page gives irrelevant info, crashes often! how do i get the old version back?

Version 3.1.0 2013-27-12 5
 (Social Media Enterpreneuer) My Silicon Valley Odyssey began with a single e-mail, introducing me to my welcoming International host & hostess. Where will the fates take you?

Version 3.1.0 2013-27-12 3
 (Useful to a point; could be better) It's rather nice to search through the app on my phone or tablet, however, it seems to lack the ability to check available dates via the app and it's prone to crashing. This makes the app more annoying than useful.

Version 3.1.0 2013-27-12 5
 (Great idea!) This is such a great way to travel, while acing money and meeting some awesome folks who host. The app works great!

Version 3.1.0 2013-24-12 5
 (Worked very well for me) I used this app to booked 2 stays in 2 places in Hawaii.  Had a blast.  Staying at house and cabins is way better then any resort or hotel.

Version 3.1.0 2013-23-12 5
 (Airbnb is the best!! And the app is so easy to use!!) Very user friendly app for one of the most convenient global services!! I love airbnb!!

Version 3.1.0 2013-23-12 5
 (Perfect) Ive used the app primarily as my management tool for the site and have not had any problems with it. 

The slider however should go below $110.

Version 3.1.0 2013-22-12 5
 (Amazing) What an amazing concept. Can't wait to use it!

Version 3.1.0 2013-21-12 5
 (Totally incredible) This company gets it.

Version 3.1.0 2013-20-12 4
 (Pretty good) Overall this app works smoothly. I use it most for listing and managing my own rental space. 
I am writing this review is to tell the developer
1- update the calendar to allow the user to look into the past- it would be very useful for the host to have this history available. 
2- on the host page, you might consider merging the 'listings' page into the host page; as a sub menu, perhaps. I am sure most users have only one space listed. On busy days I navigate this menu many times, and it gets annoying to pass through this useless page.

Version 3.1.0 2013-20-12 5
 (Best travel service) Love the new design interface. Cant wait to become a host to try the new host options.

Version 3.1.0 2013-20-12 1
 (5 stars really but not until the iPad version comes out.) I love this app. I'm a seasoned business traveler and I have stayed in the best hotels around the world. This app and the whole Airbnb concept has kept me away from hotels--even with all the points I have earned over the past 20 years--for vacation travel.

Our first booking was for Dublin last September; then we booked in New Orleans in November and now we're booked for Barcelona in March. I honestly don't think we'll ever book a chain hotel when we travel for pleasure in the future.

The app itself deserves 5 stars; no question. But I'm giving it 1 star in protest for not having an iPad version. Come on, Airbnb; we need an iPad version. Why is it taking you so long?

 (Useful but...) The app is crashing when scrolling and loading rentals. 

Very helpful in finding short term living. The service concept is good.

Will give three stars because of instability. If fixed, then 5 stars.

Version 3.1.0 2013-19-12 5
 (Memories of a lifetime!) Airbnb has literally changed my life! The ability to meet people all over the world and see places I would have never known about without the kind help and recommendations of locals. Not to mention unique and amazing homes that make you feel at home when you are thousands of miles away from your own! LOVE this site and app is super easy and fun to use :)

Version 3.1.0 2013-19-12 5
 (Changes the way you want to travel) Beautiful app, and so easy to use.  Not only do you see and pick the place you will be staying with stunning  pics, but you also get to learn about your host, to help you with your experience with your travel stay

Version 3.1.0 2013-19-12 5
 (Sweet) This is the Future Now

Version 3.0.2 2013-19-12 5
 (Great ap) Better than a hotel.  Great way to travel. Have used it twice and both were great experiences. Recommended

Version 3.0.2 2013-18-12 5
 (Love it!) Love it!

Version 3.0.2 2013-18-12 1
 (New update) New update is really cute and all but definitely not user friendly. You can't do a lot of things with the app anymore without having to get on a laptop, which defeats the whole purpose. You can't view alerts, accept offers or as a host look at your account/payout. Someone didn't think this one through at all. The old Airbnb was just fine.

Version 3.0.2 2013-17-12 5
 (Connected world) I've used air b'n'b twice now with surprising and enlightening results. What I find most amazing, apart from the app's quality and the great service is how it creates genuine connections with people.

Version 3.0.2 2013-17-12 4
 (Useful!) Easy to find something to do or stay or eat. Maps are very helpful.

Version 3.0.2 2013-17-12 5
 (Superb!) Simple, elegant, and functional. This app makes booking & browsing fun!

Version 3.0.2 2013-17-12 5
 (Love it!) This app is the best! I love to travel and airbnb helps me find the best places  to stay at!

Version 3.0.2 2013-17-12 4
 (Urika) Great website, amazing service, so-so app.
The new iOS 7 app is a little confusing, not at all intuitive. The old one was much better than the website itself!
Thanks Airbnb for the service though, and hope to see an ipad app soon!!

Version 3.0.2 2013-16-12 5
 (Airbnb in your pocket) Love this app. Just the right features, super clean and well crafted design.

Version 3.0.2 2013-16-12 1
 (Hatefully bad design) Airbnb should have spent as much energy thinking about how people actually will use their app as they are now spending writing fake reviews on the App Store here.  The inbox is counterintuitive.  The notifications are stuck on.  I've twice sent Special Offers to hosts where the price didn't change as I instructed it to, which embarrassed me as a host. 

I just deleted this app.  Can't do bookings on the go.  This is worse than bad - it's actually a liability.  

This is coming from an experienced Airbnb host.  

If Airbnb reads this review - fire your development team and get off your high horse.  This app is all aesthetics with no logic, and bad functioning.

Version 3.0.2 2013-15-12 1
 (It's far from being good and very far from being excellent) It's an OK app. Needs a lots of improvement. I'm a host and I rather do staff over the internet then use this app. 
Further Update
Very disappointed. Couldn't even upload photos in order to do that you have to be on the seen and shoot and upload at the same time. How stupid is that? How about already taken once?
Further update. Very disappointed once again. Interface is good but rest is even worse then was
I totally hate this app. New version is the worst.

Version 3.0.2 2013-15-12 5
 (Next level) Already love airbnb, this app brings it to a whole nother level. The app is very clean and easy to use. Especially impressed with the inbox section!

Version 3.0.2 2013-15-12 2
 (Great Concept) Cool tool for finding properties to rent.  But the UI isn't friendly - entered my cc info - didn't put in the full year for the expiry - so the app just did nothing - should have at least given an error message - I thought it froze ...

Version 3.0.2 2013-15-12 5
 (The only listing sight you need to be on!) We use Airbnb whenever we travel. It has also been a huge tool in the success of our rental property. Their customer service is unmatchable. The website and app are user friendly and reliable. If you are considering renting your property or a bedroom in your home, start here!

Version 3.0.2 2013-14-12 5
 (I LOVE THIS APP!) Everything about it is great. Although I have yet to book reservations using it, Im well on my way for the coming summer. I look forward to it as I am very confident in this app. :D

Version 3.0.2 2013-13-12 1
 (Just wrong.) If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

This version is terrible. Often says I haven't responded to a message when I have, doesn't allow you to pre-save responses to guests... terrible and sloppy work, Airbnb. 

You should he embarrassed you created such fanfare around the new app, only to set yourself and your users up for horrible disappointment. Shame.

Version 3.0.2 2013-13-12 5
 (Love this site) I just booked a overseas airbnb stay, very easy and I've booked a couple of stays in my molokai condo. This is so much fun, the future looks bright. I love Travel can't wait to do lots more. Aloha

Version 3.0.2 2013-13-12 5
 (Great app!) Awesome!

Version 3.0.2 2013-12-12 5
 (Easy to use) Works well. Easy to use. Most of the same features of full website.

Version 3.0.2 2013-12-12 2
 (Pretty but somewhat useless as a host) The app is lovely however as a host I am unable to access all of my messages. 

Times are incorrect. A new activity hasn't shown up in over a day – I had an inquiry that I preapproved yesterday and it isn't showing up, but one that I answered 2 days ago is showing up as a priority for me to take care of and lists "one day ago" as the time.

Individual messages threads in the app are in descending order from oldest to newest which is unhelpful because almost everything else in the app and online are in the opposite order. The messages themselves are listed in no particular order. There is no search either in the app or online.

I'm trying to reach a guest who stayed with me two weeks ago, but I can't find the message thread in the host inbox on the app and I can't figure out how to reach her any other way on the app.

Version 3.0.2 2013-10-12 1
 (Not a fan) I love airbnb, but I really can't stand this app. It's prettier than the older version but not very user friendly. I can manage my calendar availability but I can't specify a custom price for the newly available days (instead I have to go to the website to do it). I also cannot change the order of my listing's photos on the app, and when I change it on the website the new order is not reflected on the app (what's that about?)... There is no way to delete old messages and the Host Home section displays unnecessary information and doesn't allow you to delete notifications that you don't care about. There are also a slew of other sections that are completely useless. Please, just give us the core functions that we use regularly on the site and need while away from a computer.

Version 3.0.2 2013-10-12 1
 (Awful.) Terrible bubble design, no options to delete messages that are spam. "Enquiries" is the wrong spelling and notifications for messages pop up despite having been replied to. Ver annoying. Freezes easily.

Version 3.0.2 2013-10-12 5
 (A Traveler's Essential) Best looking app I've seen by far. I haven't used this app much because I own a iPod Touch and not an iPhone. When I do use it I've never seen it crash. I never seem to be able to receive push notifications. When you search locations by map some property's price do not reflect actual price per night. Please fix!

Version 3.0.2 2013-10-12 5
 (Love it.) No downside, only up. Great app, great people connected to the app.
I use this app for places to stay around the world!

Version 3.0.2 2013-09-12 5
 (<3) Absolutely love this app, you just find so many awesome places to stay that you would otherwise never find. I just wish they had a "favorite" or "bookmark" option :/

Version 3.0.2 2013-09-12 5
 (best) love the wide selection of places to stay in differnt cities. have tried once and will definitely continue using. love it!!

Version 3.0.2 2013-09-12 1
 (New version is horrible!!) Great service but this new update is aweful!  I can't imagine a less intuitive interface but the real problem is with the notifications.  When I'm logged out I still get them!  My wife and I have been renting our place for more than a year and we share the correspondence.  When I'm logged in, she logs out and vice versa.  The problem is, with this version there is no logging out.  Also, the badges never go away!  Just ridiculous.

Version 3.0.2 2013-08-12 5
 (I hate to Admit it) I write this review reluctantly. Not because AirBNB is not a good service, in fact it's quite the opposite. It has been so good for us that we are booking our home about 15 nights a month! And we haven't advertised! 
My reluctance comes from the fear that the more people that use AirBNB, the more competition we'll have. But then again, friends tell friends and I feel like the folks at AirBNB are my friends so I should spread the word instead of keeping my mouth shut like I want. 
So let it be known that this is the easiest way to have a Bed and Breakfast INSTANTLY! Their App lets me know who is inquiring, when they've booked and when they are arriving. Then after my guests have left their money is deposited into my account. I really don't have to think. It leaves me the Bed and Breakfast to host and to thoroughly enjoy our guests from all over the world - kind of like traveling, but we don't have to leave home. So on short - THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER!

Version 3.0.2 2013-08-12 1
 (Bad app!! To Mach complicated) Bad app!! To Mach complicated

Version 3.0.2 2013-07-12 2
 (Interface is slow, typing unresponsive) The previous version of this app was much easier to navigate. To much of the space is wasted in design aspects. Not so good for hosts responding to inquires.

Version 3.0.2 2013-07-12 5
 (World Traveller) I live on the road and airbnb has not only allowed me the ability to have homes all over th works, it has given me trusting relationships, there's nothing like that feeling of home, less the lobby, elevator feel of hotels, have a place to host and cook adds to my case..highly recommended

Version 3.0.2 2013-07-12 2
 (Way Too Buggy) I have had a really difficult time using the newest version. It is really awkward and slow. The old one wasn't great, but this one is way harder.

Version 3.0.2 2013-06-12 1
 (Love AIRBNB Dislike App) I love the company but the new app is unnecessarily complicated. Would like to see a return to simplicity of old app.

Version 3.0.2 2013-06-12 1
 (Old version great! This version NOT!) So tired of companies that try fixing what is not broken and kinda shoot themselves in the foot in the process.

The previous/original version of this app was like the website and was a pleasure to use both visually and functionally.
In the original app one could save a variety of replies to perfect the communication that makes Airbnb work so well. NOT this one.
Oh, so 'pretty'! Bah!!!
Visually cluttered, and counter intuitive.

I'm a big fan of Airbnb, but this upgrade was poorly thought out and forcing me to do less on the go and wait until I can get on a computer to use the site.
I am no longer confident and comfortable w my communications thru the app.

Version 3.0.2 2013-06-12 4
 (Love AirBnB, new app takes some getting used to) The new update has taken some getting used to, and I still don't like certain things about it- but some update features really are great. I've had a great time as an airbnb host for several months now, and have learned through trial and error how to accept guests responsibly. Airbnb staff have been helpful when I've had issues.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-12 3
 (Not really liking the new app) I really liked the old app and find its difficult to make special deals as a host and to navigate the site. I liked the old app much better.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-12 4
 (Airbnb is awesome!!) We have used Airbnb 3x this year and found it to be professional and a streamed lined service. Have recommended it for others to use. Only negative is having to give them everything  but your first born for verifications.

Version 3.0.1 2013-05-12 5
 (Easiest, most secure, amazing selection!) I'm so excited for my trip to Italy, but was dreading the hotel booking process. Accommodations in Europe are so different than US--with most of the good deals and charm being hard to discover via the Internet. If one wants to avoid an overpriced, cookie cutter Marriott, you need to be in the know. Which I am not. Cue Airbnb!  Where you can find charm, quality, unique character at a fair price. Love this app!

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-12 3
 (Great service but...) My only beef with the app vs the website is that the app doesn't allow you to search based on the dates you want to travel.  I've spotted several ideal locations only to find that the dates I need aren't available.  The website only shows places available when I need them.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-12 1
 (If zero was an option!) I hate the new App! Why did you make so many stupid changes? More info- yeah ok, but come on, circles and more circles, can't navigate anywhere endless viscous circle. Wish I could un-update and just use the old version which was straight forward and logical. New is NOT always better.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-12 1
 (Looks beautiful but work horribly!) The inbox is a nightmare.  It doesn't update it's notifications, so you accidentally can respond more than once to the same message.  Please fix!!

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-12 1
 (Love airbnb) I don't know what happen to you guys, but if the idea was to help us manage out reservations, you guys ruined it. This new app is a waste of time. There's no way to keep organized reservation. It takes forever to load, when it loads. It crashes all the time. Now I'm completely dependent on my computer to manage reservations. Good bye to the ability to control  my reservations anywhere. I want the old app back!

Version 3.0.2 2013-03-12 1
 (Nightmare) This new app is horrible. The old version so much better and more intuitive. I'm a host and I'm worried I'll miss something because it seems like they focused on making it look cool but it's basically worthless and counterintuitive.

Version 3.0.2 2013-03-12 1
 (Crash & crash) 6 crash antes de empezar a usar la app, no se como la han aprobado desde AppStore

Version 3.0.2 2013-03-12 1
 (constant crashing) could be great, but crashes constantly on iPad. Having only iPhone version is a problem; can only use landscape mode for pics. Needs ability to sort results by price/size/features. Also no keyword search, and no way I've found to search all of a user's listings. If it's there, it's too hard to find.

Version 3.0.2 2013-02-12 5
 (Excelente aplicación) Una muy buena manera de compartir lugares, experiencias y una excelente herramienta para hacer una guía de viajes.

Version 3.0.2 2013-02-12 3
 (New app) I hate the new app. The old interface was much better - I've lost a lot of the capability I had w the old app.  This feels like it's just change for the sake of change. 

I will admit, however, that the new groups is a good thing.

But I don't have the ability to contact tech support thru the app.  :-(

Version 3.0.2 2013-02-12 5
 (I love airbnb) I really like airbnb is a good app, can make me easy to find good place to stay, safety comfortable and nice, sometime just can let me feel where I stay just like my home.i like airbnb and I love it . I love travel ! Every time, I travel with airbnb at that time I knew where is my home tonight !

Version 3.0.2 2013-01-12 5
 (Completely changes how I travel) Meet great hosts, stay at clean apartments, easy booking and arrangements

Version 3.0.2 2013-01-12 4
 (Great! One suggestion...) I've been a guest 3 times. NYC twice, first time not great & false advertising by host, 2nd time host had roommate issues, very uncomfortable situation so I didn't stay, in LA great place & location, but then plumbing issues-no fault to host or myself. As a host its been good, mostly nice & respectful guests and the app is very helpful to manage everything. I would like to be able to update calendar availability using the app... right now it can only be done from main website.

Version 3.0.0 2013-01-12 1
 (Why????) Like many others have said, the old version was so much better. The version is awkward and not user friendly, difficult to navigate and to find info/functions I need. It was so easy before. I want easy, not sleek.

Version 3.0.2 2013-30-11 1
 (Confusing, buggy and endless badges) This new app is awful. One thing that really gets be are the badges that never disappear, even from old inquiries. I'm seconds from uninstalling just from the badges alone. On top of that I don't know the differences between panels and everything is hidden. The preapprove button is hidden for c's sake!

Version 3.0.2 2013-29-11 1
 (Awful) This app does NOT work at all on my iPhone 5( iOS 6.1.3). After deleting and reinstalling it again and again, it still remains frozen. I can look at their listings, but I can't contact any of the people who rent their apartments. Therefore, this app is pretty useless. By the way, the listings on their website are completely different.

Version 3.0.1 2013-29-11 1
 (TERRIBLE) This app is terrible for hosts on ipad. I got an email over 2 weeks ago they were trying to fix the bugs. Clearly this is low priority for airbnb. I see this as crappy customer service. I can't tell whether the reply's I send out are going out or not. I can't erase old messages. It's junk. Fix it. Worth a zero star rating.

Version 3.0.2 2013-29-11 1
 (Anyone knows how to downgrade???) Please

Version 3.0.2 2013-29-11 3
 (Legal crap) Great for Hotel finding but u have to agree to their terms before u can use the app is just BS. U are better off going on the Internet.

Version 2.6.1 2013-29-11 5
 (Amazing App) This app allowed us to travel all through Italy, making reservations as we went. Amazing experience!

Version 3.0.2 2013-29-11 1
 (Absolutely horrible usability) These guys must have hired a UX team who never used the service before. This app looks beautiful but it is an absolute mess from a usability standpoint. Something needs to be done...fast.

Version 3.0.1 2013-29-11 1
 (What a mess) Completely not user friendly interface, cumbersome, very slow. Previous version was better, and that is saying something.

Version 3.0.2 2013-28-11 3
 (Good but...) Keeps a notification up all the time even when there's nothing new happening. It's pretty irritated and unnecessary. I get that they're trying to make sure that people respond but when you're in the middle of communications about a possible booking it shouldn't keep a push notification up the whole time the inquiry is open and I can't find any option to undo that. Calm down air bnb, stop having such a needy app :) 
Aside from that it's fine. Was fine before, fine now. Nothing else to say

Version 3.0.2 2013-28-11 2
 (Crashes frequently in this version) I does look nice though but likes to crash when scrolling through pictures and is really slow when you try to share a location.

Version 3.0.2 2013-28-11 1
 (Dislike this version) Crashes all the time! Very frustrating.

Version 3.0.2 2013-27-11 1
 (Very Frustrating.) Good idea, unfortunately, it doesn't work. App hangs frequently.

Version 3.0.2 2013-27-11 2
 (Not happy) I have been host since 2011. Old version was easy to use now I don't even like to use this new app. I just answer to inquires that I will reply when home by computer.
Typing messages is really frustrating it's soooooo sloooow. Inbox constantly shows messages even dough I have answered to all of them. Told my girlfriend to keep old version and I will work on her iPhone now when needed. Not happy!

Version 3.0.2 2013-27-11 5
 (Best travel accommodation app) Awesome layout, very intuitive, and beautifully designed functional app.

Version 3.0.2 2013-27-11 5
 (Fantastic App) One of the best user experiences you can get on a listing iOS app. Totally love how easy georgeous flats could be found & booked. 

People complaining about lacking fancy places in their area and one-staring the app are dumb.

Version 3.0.2 2013-27-11 1
 (New app is cruddy.) Crashes and hangs. New user interface looks sleek but feels horrible. This update feels like a rush job with little actual QA work done.

Version 3.0.2 2013-26-11 2
 (Frozen) Just upgraded. Screen has been frozen for over 5 minutes. Will have to reboot iPhone.

Version 3.0.1 2013-26-11 5
 (Functional and well done) I love being able to respond so quickly and easily with my guests through the app. I love airbnb anyway but I am glad they have such a good app.

Version 3.0.2 2013-26-11 3
 (Awesome service..) ..crummy new interface. Approve and deny buttons used to be on the same page as leaving a message. That should be a no-brainer. Now it is two steps. Dumb.

Version 3.0.2 2013-25-11 1
 (Airbnbs newest app) Horrible, not user friendly. Old one was MUCH better.

Version 3.0.2 2013-25-11 5
 (A favorite app) Love it, Airbnb changed how I travel and the app is easy to use.

Version 3.0.2 2013-24-11 5
 (Quick and easy way to book your next vacation stay!) I've been using airbnb for the last few years and I can't find a better way to book rooms for all of my getaways. Stateside or overseas, it's my favorite site that connects me with the coolest locations to stay. And a plus, the app is just as easy as the website. I love the vacation ideas when it first opens up and the wish list function. It allows me to bum around in there anytime to see where I want to take my next trip. It's a great function to have it linked to your phone number and personal email so you have easy access to messages from hosts. Something that can be a time crunch depending on how you choose to plan :) All that said, I love the app and the site and tell EVERYONE about it.

Version 3.0.2 2013-24-11 3
 (Ok app) Doesn't have a lot of users in my area

Version 3.0.2 2013-24-11 2
 (Frustrating, disappointing service) When we arrived to our Airbnb reservation, we discovered the place could not accommodate as many as advertised.  We called Airbnb to help us resolve the issue, and they provided no assistance, nor would they hold the owner responsible for their listing. Frustrating and disappointing.

Version 3.0.2 2013-24-11 5
 (Great app. Even better travel experience.) First off, the travel experience that Airbnb delivers is both solid and revolutionary. It turns the lodging industry on its head by allowing travelers to go to unique places and interact with interesting an nice locals. Authentic travel is back. I've used Airbnb throughout Europe and the USA, and I've had success at every location. 

Second, this app update is impressive. The Airbnb app was already a good product, but 3.0 improves. The process of moving through the screens (especially jumping from search to profile to hosting) is simplified and the UI is cleaner. 

Download the app, and explore the world... or start small and go to an interesting town in your area: there is probably an Airbnb location there.

Version 3.0.2 2013-24-11 5
 (Best travel lodging app) Wide variety of unique places to stay on vacation or in your city.

Version 3.0.2 2013-23-11 2
 (Crashes) Crashes every 10 minutes.

Version 3.0.2 2013-23-11 5
 (Great service!) Airbnb is awesome!

Version 3.0.1 2013-23-11 1
 (It's so bad...) It's so bad, it crashed and froze as soon as I opened it.  I've been trying for over half an hour just to figure out how to unfreeze it, or, better yet, switch back to the old app.  But it's stuck and so am I.  Because of this awful app, it seems I won't be able to use airbnb again from my phone.  Ever.  Unless they make a new app that actually works....

Version 3.0.1 2013-23-11 5
 (The best way to travel) Airbnb and the homes available are truly great

Version 3.0.1 2013-23-11 1
 (Horrible design) I think you got on the flat train a bit too fast. Wazzup with the small fonts, the low contrast? Its hidious. U put design in front of usability. And may I say horrid design.
 People with lower computer skills as my mother are lost in the app now.
Kudos for Airbnb home though.

Version 3.0.1 2013-23-11 5
 (Warren Eirikur H   (Hbnb)) Full of choices in regards to locations, rental types, and so on. 24hr On-Line Support Staff are extremely helpfull whenever needed. All an out, a must type of app, for everyone that travels awAy from home.
   Have used Hbnb to book places to stay when traveling to Iceland. Never had any problems! Now I'm involved in hosting! Great app!

Version 3.0.1 2013-23-11 3
 (This update not reliable for Hosting) The app use to push notifications flawlessly and fast.  Before, If I had an inquiry or a message in my inbox, I would get the notification immediately, and when it had been read the little red '1' would immediately go away.  Now it's super glitchy. 

The new update is pretty ugly, and business like, which I'm sure many people appreciate, but not this right brained person.  

Besides that, it does have some great little features and still functions pretty well, I just REALLY want real time notifications to work again!  I rely on them to respond in a timely manner.

Version 3.0.1 2013-22-11 5
 (Awesome!!) Awesome and easy to use!!

Version 3.0.1 2013-22-11 1
 (New app doesn't reflect all needs) Complicated compare to earlier version

Version 3.0.1 2013-22-11 5
 (Treasure) This App is a lucky charm for avid travelers; if you're looking to explore the world while trying to save money as much as possible this is for you! I was happy I found this app because I'm planning on going home to the Philippines next year and they have a bunch of listing! It helps that most listings are very descriptive and have photos so you would know what to expect.

Version 3.0.0 2013-22-11 1
 (Update hangs, won't complete) Tried to update, no luck! Will not finish downloading. I'm still running iOS 6 on my iPad 3

Version 3.0.1 2013-22-11 5
 (Awesome App!) Great for getting travel and hosting information on the go!

Version 3.0.1 2013-22-11 5
 (Awesome app for adventure planning!) Awesome app for adventure planning in the near or distant future! This app is also on top of its technical design! Kudos app design team! :)

Version 3.0.1 2013-21-11 1
 (This update is useless for hosts) I guess they meant well putting in all the flashy fanciness but from a host perspective it makes it really hard to manage things. The version before was nice and simple, you knew where to do things and didn't really need your computer. 
Now I'd rather wait with doing anything until I'm back at my computer and can use the website. 
UI fail.

Version 3.0.1 2013-21-11 1
 (Broken) The new version is terrible for hosts. I can't see or manage my listing and have no way to access my inbox. Then I stupidly signed out to see if signing in fresh would help... Now I'm locked out. I keep getting a server error. AirBNB: Please fix ASAP so we can continue managing our listings via our phones.

Version 3.0.1 2013-21-11 1
 (New version makes hoating a NIGHTMARE) Dont upgrade

Version 3.0.1 2013-21-11 5
 (Best design) Intuitive design that matches current iOS UI style. Extremely responsive and more importantly, the privacy settings are transparent and straightforward. Great job airbnb

Version 3.0.1 2013-21-11 4
 (useful) not bad

Version 3.0.1 2013-21-11 5
 (Excellent app) Very friendly version, easy to follow on the mobile app, no worries of cc declined or people back ground.
Highly recommended if you want to make some extra money.

Version 3.0.1 2013-21-11 5
 (Horrible Flat looking icon - what windows icons looked a long time ago) The app is great - but I hate how their icon looks. Flat...

Version 3.0.1 2013-21-11 5
 (Great app for travel) Very good app for travel no longer need to book a hotel airbnb much better rates allow you to experience local life style. 

Ps loved new simplified design...

Version 3.0.1 2013-20-11 5
 (Perfect for world travelers) About to venture off on our tour to happiness and see what we have been dreaming about! Couldn't ask for a better app that enables that exploration!!! :) #backpackers #oddplacestostay

Version 3.0.1 2013-20-11 1
 (This Version is a Beta/Downgrade.) First off, I find it disrespectful for software developers to change EVERYTHING in one version change.  I'm a host. We are daily users of your application and trying to run a business.  With that said, the new version needs to at least better then the previous and this version fails. Problems I've found:

1. Can't view guest full profile pictures, typically heads get cut off.  FAIL.
2. Software bugs, it often reads 'NULL' in places where the title of your property would be.
3. Biggest problem for me as a host, you can't send special offers after you've already preapproved.  So it you are trying to negotiate a rate, you have to goto their website.  The old version can do that at any point.
4. Layout is horrible.  The organization of information is not intuitive, I still find my self digging for things.

Version 3.0.1 2013-20-11 1
 (Reservations) The reservations tab is gone! I have multiple units so this tab was very helpful. Now I have to look at multiple calendars to keep up with who is checking in/out. Cumbersome!  Please bring it back.

Version 3.0.1 2013-20-11 1
 (Worse for hosts not better) Sigh. i cannot use new app to manage bookings like i could in the previous version. how do i revert back? sure it looks good, style over substance doest help me.

Version 3.0.1 2013-19-11 5
 (LUV IT!) Easy. 
Great experiences :)

Version 3.0.0 2013-19-11 5
 (Love it!) So convenient to use!

Version 3.0.1 2013-18-11 5
 (beautiful design) very very nice looking app and works pretty good as well

Version 3.0.1 2013-18-11 5
 (Outstanding) Simple Direct Sophisticated

This app exceeded my expectations in every way. This is the best travel booking app I have seen. Airbnb rocks!

Version 3.0.1 2013-18-11 5
 (Easy as the website) Very easy to use. I write all my reviews for our stays on this because it's so fast. Haven't booked using it but checking on current reservations and communicating through it is great. Nice design too!

Version 2.6.3 2013-18-11 3
 (Good service, adequate App) I find this app to have decent functionality, but I'm typically going to the site to do more involved tasks beyond checking in.  Also, would be nice if this actually fit a full iPad screen.

Version 3.0.1 2013-17-11 1
 (UX Designer should get fired) As a host - the functionality of this app is abysmal. They made sure to shove in translucency and parallax - but forgot to think about how this thing will be used. 

Too many swipes and clicks. Too much mental overhead. Inbox is hidden inside 'host home'. Your listings are hidden outside of it. Now try and get from one to another. 

Also, if the point is to answer inquiries as fast as possible, it would be nice if I could actually count on the app to push notifications reliably. Wouldn't mind that inbox getting a tad faster either. 

I'd love to upgrade my review when it warrants it.

Version 3.0.1 2013-17-11 5
 (Great app, great idea!) I love airbnb, the app is wonderful and the update is amazing, it simplifies everything and makes it look great on iOS7! The concept is even better and has saved my boyfriend I I tons of money traveling. Don't ever go away, airbnb!

Version 3.0.1 2013-17-11 1
 (Horrendous piece of garbage) Wow Airbnb has historically done so many things right.  Just don't upgrade.  Someone should be fired for this monstrosity of an app.  The calendar, the inbox, well, most things are just broken now.  The old app rocked, even had some nice features the website didn't have.  This new app is atrocious.

Version 3.0.1 2013-17-11 5
 (Wow what a user friendly clean concept) That version is absolutely fantastic!!!
I love it as a host especially 
but also because it really helps communicating with guests on my phone at the speed of light.
* there's a little problem though I'm sure it will be fixed soon, you can't offer a special offer from the mobile once you  pre-approved someone.
If the person asks for a revision of rate based on other guest staying less time than the one booking, or simply guest asking for a special rate.
You have to go to the computer to do this and it kills the point of that version.
Thank you Airbnb for sorting the earth:)

Version 3.0.1 2013-17-11 5
 (Great App and Great Service!) Airbnb is everything good about traveling the world! I love it!

Version 3.0.1 2013-16-11 1
 (Don't upgrade) Usually don't write reviews - but the new UI is terrible ( host perspective ) It looks negligibly better and the navigation is horrendous. It takes me 100% more time to accomplish simple tasks like pre-approving a guests stay.

Version 3.0.1 2013-16-11 4
 (Weird) My husband and I were using the app at the same time(I had the new version and he had the old one). So mine didn't show even half of the results he had got. I hope it's possible for you to fix that as the app is very useful and the upgrades make a lot of sense.

Version 3.0.1 2013-16-11 5
 (Death of Pornhub) This is the most addictive, sexually enticing experience I've ever felt on my iPhone. Shout out to the AirBNB team!!!

Version 3.0.1 2013-16-11 5
 (Great app) You guys did it. It's a beautiful app, gorgeous design. Excellent. Like it so much.

Version 3.0.1 2013-16-11 1
 (Hopelessly Crippled) Wouldn't let me sign in with Facebook, didn't accept my credit card, but full website did...broken much?

Version 3.0.0 2013-16-11 5
 (Best Travel App!) wouldn't travel anywhere without it. Incredible concept.

Version 3.0.1 2013-16-11 4
 (Dig the app OS) Its very clean and streamlined. The design is definitely to date with the times! Ive yet to use its full potential but i like it thus far.

Version 3.0.1 2013-16-11 5
 (Sweeeeeeeet) The best app ever.

Version 3.0.1 2013-16-11 5
 (Beautiful) Gorgeous app with a lot of thoughtful design behind it all. A joy to use.

Version 3.0.1 2013-15-11 5
 (Great) Great travel plannig app.

Version 3.0.0 2013-15-11 1
 (Useless for hosts) Everything is gone. I'm booked through next Feb and I have nothing on the app. Host Home is not on this app.

Version 3.0.0 2013-15-11 1
 (Serious?) Oh how I love airbnb. But this app is terrible. I don't know why they decided to change it, but the developers should be fired.

Version 3.0.0 2013-15-11 1
 (The update removed ALL HOST FEATURES) I now can't access my Host account to accept reservations, exchange emails, manage my listing, calendar, edits, nothing! It's rendered completely useless. This is an epically terrible release, if it's an error. This is an epic fail on the UX design, if this access still exists but it's it's hidden under some menu I have not found yet, despite my direct experience with UX design for apps.

Version 3.0.0 2013-15-11 1
 (Very buggy and counterintuitive) This app has been telling me for a week that I have one notification as a host, but when I clicked the host button it didn't even show I was logged in. I guess they fixed that, but now it turns out the notification was people who amicably decided to rent another room. So I guess what I need to do is go on and decline their reservation. Oops, now there's a bug that won't let me do that. Will this affect my listings rankings? Probably.

Version 3.0.0 2013-15-11 1
 (The new update is awful!) As a host I cannot view my messages. The update is pretty but has made the app useless!! What is the point of this?!?

Version 3.0.0 2013-15-11 3
 (Where are the host tools?) I couldn't access inquiries coming in or my calendar. However, once I left the app and came back in the hosting tools showed up.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 4
 (Beautiful and functional) It's much prettier than the older versions but had stayed quite fast. I like it!

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 2
 (Don't like new app design) I don't like the new app design. It is too much like a website and not enough like an app.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (Nice look, lots of bugs) Refreshing host inbox does not work. Viewing listings doesn't work. Can't write messages to go along with "pre-approval" it has to be done separate. Message threads are sorted in the wrong order.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (The newest app is worthless) Use your browser on a computer.  The newest version of the iPhone app is not functioning properly and has very limited features.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (Hosts Don't Update!!!!!) May have deleted my listing, can't find old messages anywhere, totally deleting and re downloading hoping to solve some issues, thank goodness I don't have any guests checking in today.

Total fail.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 2
 (Looks great, but not functional) I can't get any of my host inbox messages.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (Host don't download) All the features that made the app great are gone. The inbox is empty, I can only see my travel reservation emails not my hosting communication.  The calendar is gone, the new emails don't show up.  I can't manage reservations! Help.  Please fix so or let me know how to roll back.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (New version is a big disappointment) The new version has a lot of bugs that needs fixed. First off I already have listing and it is not showing. It keeps asking me to post a listing. Second it says my messages have moved as a host, yet I am not able to find them anywhere. I used to use this mobile version when I was at work. This will no longer be the case until it is fixed. This was a very frustrating update.

Version 2.5.1 2013-14-11 4
 (Not user-friendly.) Layout look so nice, but quite complicated to use. I still get lost in the app.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (What happened?) With this update it seems like the hosting functions are gone. Where's my calendar? The user interface is ridiculously obtuse. I definitely don't recommend this app. Stick with the desktop version!

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (Host Listing GONE) New update is horrible. My listing is gone, all my messages are MIA, I have a phantom notification, and the interface is a bit dizzying. Nothing wrong with the old version- why fix it if it ain't broke?!? Please revert back to what works!!!!!

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (The world in your hand) Update: very buggy update. For hosts with multiple listings, the lack of chronological check outs is a killer.(really need a multi-cal like on the web) Inbox is disorganized. I can only see 2-3 lines of text in the compose window (when using Siri dictation, I sometimes can't see anything) New inquiries don't show which listing they are asking about. Host home doesn't update correctly. Refreshing the app feels like I'm back on my dial up internet connection from the '90s. 

------------------------/

Airbnb is so incredibly empowering!  Making new friends (and I don't mean 'friends') from all over the world has never been so easy. I love the sense of trust and community we have here.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (Noooo!) As a long time host, I do all my communication on the airbnb app. Yet my reservations no longer show up here! What happened? It seems as if it is only meant for travelers. But I use this many times a day. This app is terrible.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 4
 (New version SEEMS looses features) My first experience with the new version was as described below. A day later I see a new heading, HOST HOME, which was not there before. With this new section all the features related to hosting seem to be back. Great look, layout, and easy to use. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW
This new version, 11/12/2013, looks great BUT looses so many critical features!!!!  No access to Inbox, no grouping of all reservations, no way to communicate with guests. And IF those features are there, they definitely aren't easy to find. I didn't find them!

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 5
 (LOVE!!) Great way to meet new people!!!  Amazing way to get the "real deal

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 2
 (Logout, then login) If u r missing your listings with this latest version, too, logout, then log back in. Fixed.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 5
 (Impressive iOS 7 UX) Nice work, guys.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (Horrible update) Just because the app looks similar to iOS 7 doesn't mean it's good. I am an existing host. My listing cannot be seen and there are no messages from my inbox visible on the app.

Version 3.0.0 2013-14-11 1
 (version 3.0.0 not functional) As a host, I lost my listing. Says I have 4 new 
messages but I can't find out how to access them. Very inconvenient for hosts managing listings on the go.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Stupid Interface) This app was written by people who don't know how to write mobile apps. Even the simplest thing is hard to figure out. I hope they outsource to a company that knows how to do this correctly.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Go back to the previous version.) The new version is slow and buggy. Once I turned my phone on and off the app worked better, but still not up to par with the previous version. 

New isn't always better.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (ANNOYING) The app is nice but is missing the calendar, which is annoying because I can't just check when the next check in is anymore, now I have to go on the computer to look at something that took me 5 seconds before.

Version 2.6.3 2013-13-11 1
 (Terrible) The new version doesn't really work. I can't find the messages from my potential guests anymore. The inbox has been reserved for me only as a guest! Really? In the past, I was able to see all my communications, be it as a host or as a guest, in one place. It was simple and intuitive. Why fix it when it works?

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 5
 (Sour grapes) I love the new app!  Everyone who doesn't is just spitting sour grapes. :)...  When can we get an equally awesome tablet app?

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 2
 (host area broken) same problem reported by other users.  i've hosted several times but the app seems to have no knowledge that i even have a listing up.  how did that get through QA?

and seriously, how is it possible that this still doesn't work on the ipad?!  it's not like it's a new device.. come on, guys.  kindof amazing that a company with so much funding and a fancy new office still hasn't bothered to release a version of their app that works natively on the ipad.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Broken in latest major update) As a host I am unable to communicate with my guests,  view my listings or do anything else as it relates to hosting. :(

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Help) Looks nice but the host inbox is gone. I can only see an inbox from the travel box.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Even worse with update) This app made no progress through the update, it's even worse actually. Thinking to boycott air bnb all together.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (DON'T DOWNLOAD IF YOU'RE A HOST!) I've been a host for two years. The latest version of the iPhone app is completely useless if you're a host. I cannot access my listings, calendar, or any of my current or future reservations. I'm also a long-time mobile app developer. AIRBNB SHOULD FIRE THE UX DESIGNER AND PRODUCT MANAGER WHO LAUNCHED THIS VERSION OF THE APP. They clearly put their fascination with iOS7 design aesthetic ahead of creating an app that is easy and enjoyable to use. Pathetic.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 5
 (Great new app) Airbnb has improved their app so much I would say it's the best most efficient app I'm using at the moment.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 5
 (Love) I thoroughly enjoy this app.  While traveling to luxury hotels can be relaxing and hostels can be adventurous, nothing compares to the local experience that airbnb allows you to create.  Thanks airbnb team;)

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Horrible upgrade) This new version is horrible. Wait before upgrading to restore all functionality from the old version.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 2
 (Needs improvement) New iOS 7 version has nice eye candy, but very confusing. My listing doesn't show up, and I can't find my incoming messages. Needs work.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Awful upgrade) I used to love the airbnb app. It allowed me to handles listing and boom trips on the go, communicate easily, and be alerted to changes. The new upgrade ruined it all. I cannot even get to my inbox anymore. The layout is confusing. This is a case of design overwriting functionality. Hope they remediate soon

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Bad!) As a host I lost all the features. Inbox is empty, I cannot talk with my guest, I do not see upcoming reservation,... I cannot use this app with this version!! The new update looks nice but all the features are gone.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Hosts: Do Not Upgrade!!!) I suddenly lost the ability to respond to requests and inquiries! Frustrating. Please fix soon! We love air b&b but this update made the app completely useless.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Hosting part is a total mess!) No calendar, nor emails, nor alerts!!
Please fix ASAP!

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Awful) It tells me I have 4 notifications but loops me back to the same screen over and over without even hinting at what those notifications may be. 
My inbox has only 5 messages in it - the most recent being a month old. 
I can't find my reservations list or calendar anywhere. My reviews and listings are missing too. 
I had to access the site through safari to confirm the reservation request. 
This app has become 100% useless for hosts.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 4
 (V3 is annoying and confusing) New app hide my previous  listing, can't find my Messages from other inquiries. New interface looks cute but is wasting space has no visual cues on what to do.  And I got this bizarre blue circle with a number two in it which has no meaning.....   Grrrrrrrrrr

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 5
 (Great experience with a nice host.) Love this wonderful app.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Wish I hadn't updated) I don't usually write reviews but I felt I needed to since this is the way that I make my income the app is so difficult to use I used to be able to see when guests were checking out and  checking in very clearly, now it's difficult for me to tell seeing as I have four listings on airbnb.  The messages are upside down and take so long to scroll through to find the newest message.  I can't stand this format and I wish I had never updated.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (New is not necessarily better) Having just started using the app a few days ago this new version confuses me. My main concern is why does it alert me to respond to messages I've already responded to? It's disconcerting when I'm new and trying to convey that I'm a responsive host. It has the potential to be a great app but is failing at this point.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (New App looks great but usable.) All my previous messages are gone. New messages shown but I can't find where they are. The old version was spectacular and very easy to navigate. Not sure why they gave it up.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Buggy - fewer features) If you used the last version you will immediately be disappointed. Harder to search as a guest, harder to manage as a host. The rave reviews seem inauthentic. Please bring back the less "pretty" version - which worked!

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 5
 (Works really good!) I'm a host and I'm having great results !!

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 2
 (Is this, like, a Beta version???  Cause it ain't all there!) Okay, lots of other reviewers have already listed the bugs (or at least what seems like bugs) and it almost seems like this update was rolled out before it was completed.

I like everyone else who has reviewed so far would expect that when you tap on Host, you would see your listings. You do not.

I have two notifications in the upper left corner, but when I tap the notification icon, I'm taken back to the Host section with no sign of what I'm being notified of.

Don't get me wrong, I love the new look and feel. And when the real app is rolled out I will be happy to give it 5 stars.  However, right now it's sitting at between 1 and 2 stars.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 3
 (Shiny, buggy) This is your typical shiny but full of bugs app. I've been using it for half an hour now and found two bugs already (first is: you need to login again to see your listings otherwise you are considered a new host, second is: conversations are not marked as read so you always have a badge on the app). It amazes me that these basic faults are not caught during debugging and testing.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 5
 (Best iOS 7 design yet) I've been using Airbnb for a year now on vacation and business travels, and I love the service and tell everyone to use it. But I love this new app update for iOS 7. It's by far the best design I've seen to date. Great job, guys!!

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Listings Gone, Inbox Gone, Please Revert!) I loved the old app but this one is very broken. My listing is missing, I have no host inbox and am now missing incoming responses from guests, I can't find the tools I need. 

Unfortunately seems like whoever designed this app way overstepped and didnt properly QA. Looks like back to the website for me. Please revert back to old version.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Horrible update today) What did you do???? Thus us horrible!!!

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Improvements needed for Hosts) Airbnb has destroyed its application. It doesn't work for hosts anymore. They've hidden the listings at the bottom of the profile, they have remove the lists of reservations of your space, they have remove all possibilities to update your listings. Airbnb doesn't listen to its customers, the hosts!!!!!! Without us, there's no Airbnb. Go back to the previous version.

Warning: Do not upgrade!!

------- Previous Version ----
• When replying to emails, you can't see the senders email. Not good when there are plenty of questions
• In the messages thread, there's no reference to pricing, so you don't know how much you're charging that guest, who's asking you a breakdown of the cost.
• Calendar doesn't allow you to set pricing, only availability. Huge problem when you're away and you need to change something from your phone.
• You can not update your listing from this app. Why? It gives you a new set of entries that have nothing to do with what you're dealing with on the desktop website.

These problems make this app quite often useful (literally) since you need to go back to you computer to do all these things... Beats having an app!

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Update is a SERIOUS Downgrade) The new design for version 3.0.0 is absolutely TERRIBLE. As a host who manages many locations in an apartment it is completely convoluted and the format is horrendous. 
Don't sacrifice functionality just to pander to these absurd aesthetic trends! 

If you are a serious host using this app, DO NOT UPDATE!

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (No host inbox) Can't reply to my guests

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 1
 (Not an improvement) The older version was simple, beautiful, flawless. It worked, there was really no need to mess with it. 

This new version is all white, confusing and not intuitive. Really takes away from the experience. 

Thumbs down, Airbnb. And I'm a big fan.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 5
 (Fantastic app!) Beautiful and well thought out. airbnb's dev and design team is awesome.

Version 3.0.0 2013-13-11 5
 (Insanely beautiful) Best iOS7 app I've seen yet.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 2
 (Can't get rid of notification count.) Very irritating. I had to uninstall.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 1
 (New app is confusing) I have tried for 10 minutes to read email in the new app and check on my existing reservations as a host.  I finally had to go to the web/safari to learn that I had a guest that had confirmed.  I also can't see my calendar.  Very very poor redesign

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (Life changer) We'd had a good experience using Airbnb as guests attending an out of town wedding. At the urging of a friend, we became hosts. It's been great in terms both of meeting cool people, and making ends meet. The app makes doing it whilst on the go a snap.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 2
 (App crashes when trying to accept reservation) Great concept however it appears they still haven't fixed the underlying problem of accurate reviews. No one ever leaves fair and accurate reviews in fear of a retaliatory review.  Also how about in app phone call capabilities using the airbnb phone service. Had to log out and back into the app to get it to work. 2 stars but willing to give more if they deliver on their promise to make for a better experience and not a worse one.  love the AirBnB concept and look foward to improvements in the program.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (Love it) Great new app. Much improved.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (New Airbnb App is AIRMAZING!) I just deleted a duplicate listing right from my phone. Ha! Took 2 seconds. The app is beautiful to look at, easy to navigate and I can do sooooooo much on there!!!! Totally legit <3

Version 2.5.1 2013-12-11 5
 (Fantastic app) I really like the new version. It is soo better for hosts, saved me a lot of time answering to guests.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 4
 (Beautiful and does the job) However, I experienced choppy scrolling on iPhone 4S. And it crashed on first usage. Hence I'm holding one star for ransom. Otherwise, great app.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (Gorgeous redesign) New design looks great and works well too.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 3
 (Loyal host. Hate new app) I lost all of my previous messages in my inbox. It says I have an alert under the host tab, but I can't seem to find it... The number icon is annoying. I don't mind the bells and whistle, but I care about the functionality more. I loooove airbnb, so please use it, but the new app might have a few bugs..

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (Awesome!) Great for guests and hosts

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 1
 (Major bugs) Visual refresh is nice, but with all the emphasis on the new hosting section I no longer have access to my listing under host, but if I go to my account, I can see my listing listed. The hosting section just wants me to list a new listing...

Curiously, My Facebook profile doesn't show up in the profile section but does in the sidenav.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (A great app made even better!) Tons of new updates for hosts and a great new UI for everyone really makes this app a must have for Airbnbers. Love it!

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (so much better) It makes search and booking on my iPhone so much easier than before

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 1
 (I can't find Host Home) I have no idea where to find my reservations and guests. What happened?  Host Home looks awesome but I don't see it anywhere in the menu!!

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 2
 (Don't Download Yet. Rollback Needed.) We love AirBnb, but v3.0 breaks the Hosting function in the app. 

After today's rah-rah broadcast, we enthusiastically updated. The app is pretty, and the Travel side seems fine. However, my listings are missing, so... basically useless right now. I am rolling back to the last version ASAP.

Long story short (too late), don't download yet.

Hey, AirBnb, please fix this soon. And keep up the good work.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (I love airbnb) Everything about airbnb is well though and user friendly. Best way to say good bye to hotels and save money and make money. I love the app on the Iphone5 awesome!

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (Beautiful) The new app looks amazing! Stunning, and really easy to use. Kudos

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (Wonderful) What can I say? The new update for iOS7 totally rocks. Loving it, great apps, great UI, and great jobs from you guys.

Version 2.6.3 2013-12-11 5
 (Awesome Design) UI matches the new, flat iOS7 design. The functionality is amazing, great update!

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (Sharp UI/UX) Wow! Once again Airbnb.com nails it.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 1
 (FEW BUGS. Looks good but please fix.) 1. Inbox displays first message at the top.  So you have scroll all the way to the bottom to get your latest message. HASSLE if you had a long conversation with host. 

2. Your selection for entire home/ share / private is backward. At first they are all highlighted in blue. When you select one it turns grey you would think that's the one you selected but it's not you actually have to select lets say share & private if you want to have Entire home be selected. So you have to grey out the other two to have one highlighted blue. Why make a user click two extra buttons to select one item?

3. When you select a month time frame 30days.  Your price filter should automatically adjust and not stay stuck at $1000 max. You actually have to save the filter then go back into it to change the slider so it can recognize it's for 30 days. This is BACKWARDS. A user should be able to choose a date when the calendar sees an input above 30days the price slider should reflex month pricing and remove $1000 cap. 

4. Your side menu looks a bit convoluted.  It's not easy for a user to distinguish how he scroll to the next menu and how to go back to the main screen.  It's not making things very obvious to the user. 

HOPE BUG GETS UPDATED. JUST TRYING TO HELP.

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 5
 (The best of app) Parabéns pelo app novo, ele está sensacional. Cada dia eu me apaixono mais pela comunidade airbnb..

Congratulations application again, is sensational. Every day I adimiro more Community airbnb

Version 3.0.0 2013-12-11 1
 (My listings are gone) App looks great my listings aren't showing up, it just keeps asking me to post a new listing even though I already have 4.

Version 2.6.3 2013-12-11 5
 (Best service!) Great set up and verification process. Best experiences traveling to unique spots. Wonderful people involved. Highly recommended.

Version 2.6.3 2013-10-11 2
 (Bad for Host = bad for guest) I'm going on my 3rd year as an airbnb host and we're approaching $100,000 in Airbnb revenue on 1 property alone.  They have been absolutely transformational for our vacation rental business, which is great, but the dumb app never seemed to work well for me as a host. It doesn't allow some of the most basic pricing and calendar task to be completed or even viewed from
My phone! This makes it almost impossible to respond to guest inquiries on the fly. A real problem when traveling myself! Im left with no option but to message my hopeful guest that I will have to get back to them with the pricing questions they have in a few days because I don't have access to my office computer. Makes me and Airbnb seem like a bunch of Amateurs. Ops, Lol, that's right, even if we're not.

Version 2.6.3 2013-08-11 5
 (FABULOUS APP AND BUSINESS!) I'm a host and I LOVE the ease of the app and it's multitude of features. I actually set up my entire BnB from New York (complete with photos) and booked guests weeks in advance before I even got home and stepped foot back in to the cottage in California! 
Once the slider is fixed for users to search more easily on an iPhone/iPad I would rate this app 6/5 if I could!!

Version 2.6.3 2013-06-11 5
 (The best) Not a single complaint. Wish I had discovered it sooner

Version 2.6.3 2013-06-11 5
 (Wonderful) Great for finding one of a kind places to stay!

Version 2.6.3 2013-06-11 5
 (Vacations) Perfect app ever

Version 2.6.3 2013-04-11 5
 (Great app!) Worked for us first time!

Version 2.6.3 2013-04-11 5
 (Five Star app) An amazingly intuitive and simple design structure. Thank you!

Version 2.6.3 2013-04-11 5
 (Great app) The best app on my phone & ipad. Quick and intuitive, it makes being a host and guest a breeze.

Version 2.6.3 2013-02-11 5
 (Amazing!!!!) By far one of the best apps on the App Store! It is incredibly well designed and so easy to use. Very rarely do I enjoy using an app more than the website!!!

Version 2.6.3 2013-02-11 5
 (I'm headed to explore the world and save money) I truly love this service. Cheap and easy to travel anywhere and you always find a friendly host. Much better than a hotel a billion times.

Version 2.6.3 2013-02-11 5
 (I'm headed to explore the world and save money) I truly love this service. Cheap and easy to travel anywhere and you always find a friendly host. Much better than a hotel a billion times.

Version 2.6.3 2013-31-10 5
 (AirBnB > Traditional Hotels) We are addicted to AirBnB. Why would stay at a traditional hotel ever again?

Version 2.6.3 2013-31-10 3
 (Need additional sort and filter options) Love the app. Need to be able to filter by amenities and sort results by price.

Version 2.6.3 2013-30-10 1
 (Have a problem? App doesn't work) If you have a problem with your reservation the online resolution tool doesn't work on the app. Try to call? They send you back online, to an app that takes your booking great but won't help you cancel or contact customer support. It's just a scam.

Version 2.6.3 2013-29-10 5
 (Terrific, all around!) Excellent idea.  Great app that is a breeze to use and that keeps you informed.  Use it, you WILL love it.

Version 2.6.3 2013-28-10 5
 (Great App but Where's the Calendar?!) Life changing site- but need to see property's dates of availability with calendar view like on the site.  
Still giving you five stars though since you're awesome.

Version 2.6.3 2013-28-10 5
 (Phenomenal!!) I just booked a weekend getaway accommodation using this app....I'm hooked! Awesome, awesome concept.  Process is fun, easy, inviting, and an eye-opening experience. It's possible to travel without paying outrageous hotel costs. I love this app!!!

Version 2.6.3 2013-27-10 2
 (Where is the iPad App ?) Cumulative iPad sales as of Oct. 22, 2013 - 170 million
Airbnb iPad App - None

Version 2.6.3 2013-27-10 2
 (Slider problem) I love airbnb, but for some reason the price slider will not go below $114. What the heck! Will just have to use my computer version till they fix this.

Version 2.6.3 2013-27-10 5
 (At your fingertips) Great App for a great housing service!
I can reply to guest inquiries within the allotted 24 hours easily.
I can book a place from my mobile phone anywhere anytime.
Home stays in Europe (and probably elsewhere) are so much better than hotels, hostels, etc. and cheaper. This App makes it easy.
I love the ability to touch to make dates "unavailable".
Airbnb is excellent. So is this App! Well done!

Version 2.6.3 2013-22-10 4
 (Benifit from travel around with best location bugget price) Go to London stay in center no more mean expensive, very reasonable price and good choice to air B&B. Great.

Version 2.6.3 2013-22-10 5
 (Love airbnb, love the app) Mmm, thanks for all the vacation dreaming

Version 2.6.3 2013-21-10 5
 (Best App EVER!!!) Best App EVER!!!

Version 2.6.3 2013-21-10 5
 (👍❤️❤️) Sweet app and service.

Version 2.6.3 2013-20-10 1
 (Hard to use) Not easy to use and pretty confising

Version 2.6.3 2013-20-10 5
 (Amazing) Highly transformative.
Can't wait for airbnb for cross country transportation (flights)...

Version 2.6.3 2013-18-10 5
 (Very Helpful) So Far So Good

Version 2.6.3 2013-18-10 5
 (Money maker) Ice you learn to protect your home and at the same time rent to "good" people you've got something good. Love my airbnb relationship

Version 2.6.3 2013-18-10 3
 (Love it but...) Needs more search options/filters!

Version 2.6.3 2013-17-10 4
 (Needs more options) Great app but please add more options like writing reviews, checking calendars, etc. And update the UI and icon to match the look of iOS 7!

Version 2.6.3 2013-17-10 5
 (Review) You know how people can spend hours on Instagram and Pinterest? Well, I spend hours on airbnb! Love this app.

Version 2.6.3 2013-15-10 5
 (Great App!!) The ability to review and book great places at your fingertips!  Great site and great app.

Version 2.6.3 2013-15-10 5
 (Gets the job done!) This app can make your fantastic weekend happen!

Version 2.6.3 2013-14-10 5
 (Incredible) Very easy to use and is as accessible and easy to use as the website. Love this app!!!

Version 2.6.3 2013-13-10 5
 (Saved my skin) App allowed me to respond quickly to any and very situation to my new BFF site:Airbnb !!!

Version 2.6.3 2013-12-10 5
 (Love you Airbnb!) So easy to access & use from iPhone.

Version 2.6.3 2013-12-10 5
 (So much awesome!) Love this app... Super easy to use and then get lost in all of the dreamy adventure!

Version 2.6.1 2013-11-10 5
 (Love the App and Customer Service) I know there are limitations to the iPhone app but they are minor compared to fact that even though I don't book everyone who inquires, so many people are able to search for and view my property. 

Customer Service is the best I have ever experienced. They are very knowledgeable and expedite issues. 

I highly recommend Airbnb for Hosts and Travelers. I will be traveling around the holidays and will use Airbnb. I also hope to be able to use Airbnb for our large family Reunion next summer.

Version 2.6.3 2013-10-10 5
 (Saved my Life) AirBnB you are a dream to use! Ever since you sent a professional photog over to my place to snap pics I fell in love. And the app to accompany your website is superb! Anyone that is complaining needs to understand that the app does all the basics that you need (from the host side) and even more on the guests side. The pictures to accompany the posts, along with the map friendly posts are insane. Thx for changing the way I backpack and experience the WORLD!!

Version 2.6.3 2013-10-10 2
 (Frustrating) Where's the calendar...????? Kind of important!

Version 2.6.3 2013-10-10 5
 (Very happy host) I'm glad to have this to be able to respond quickly to reservations!

Version 2.6.3 2013-08-10 4
 (Passbook support is broken in recent update) One of the recent updates to the app has broken passbook integration. This was working just a couple weeks ago because I used it. Now when I try to add a stay to passbook it brings up the "loading" mask but quickly falls back to the reservation I am looking at, and nothing is added to passbook.

Version 2.6.3 2013-07-10 4
 (Problem with passbook) This app is great, I'm just having some trouble trying to add a passbook pass to my passbook. It keeps loading but it won't add.

Version 2.6.3 2013-07-10 5
 (Life changing app) This app and business in general have been a life changing moment for myself and my family. Having AirBnB at my finger tips while I am living my daily life has been so great. I can manage my listings and communication with guests. I am very happy with its usability.

Version 2.6.3 2013-05-10 5
 (Fix the slider) The app is good, though the iPhone interface on the ipad is kind of clunky and annoying. It's nice to access the basic contact info for your hosts without a web connection. However the inability to slide the price range under $114 makes it basically unusable for me (and the price slider on the web version is also annoying as hell, so that's saying something). If that part was fixed, I would use the app a lot more.

Version 2.6.3 2013-04-10 5
 (Amazing Gem!!) This app turns a normal vacation into a home-made adventure...by staying in neighborhood homes in far-off places, we felt immersed in the culture and cared for by people that knew the land the best!! I am a huge fan of Air BNB, I love that the app is secure, payments are made easily and safely, and all the photos are verified as being accurate.  Huge fans of this app.

Version 2.6.3 2013-03-10 5
 ((Firstees!) Quicker than full version to view reservations for hosts.) B+

Version 2.6.2 2013-03-10 5
 (Nice design) Great job airbnb. And what a party in LA! Woohoo!

Version 2.6.2 2013-01-10 5
 (First trip to Japan) We just returned from our first trip using Airbnb and we are excited!  We were not sure what to expect at first, but using this app has been seamless. Everything was as written and agreed upon! No hidden fees, no surprise taxes, etc. we look forward to using this app for all of our vacation plans in the future!

Version 2.6.2 2013-01-10 3
 (Crashing when accessing Favorites) I've updated everything but the app suddenly crashes when I select "Favorites". Otherwise a very handy app. I hope it gets fixed soon.

Version 2.6.2 2013-30-09 2
 (Can't save favorites) When I try to save favorites the app just closes. Every time. Not cool.

Version 2.6.2 2013-30-09 4
 (Works great... Needs an ipad version!) I haven't had any problems working on an ipad mini, but a native ipad version would be sweetness

Version 2.6.2 2013-29-09 5
 (I don't know of a better app for traveling.) Best travel app ever. Works great for iphone5S

Version 2.6.2 2013-29-09 4
 (Great app) Just started using air bnb with this app. It is really well designed and based on a good premise. It is quick to send inquiries to hosts and it is very streamlined in every way. My only complaint is that the hosts address is not displayed on the page when it is pre approved, like on the website. Several times we were left without an address looking for the place by pictures and directions alone, which was frustrating. 

All in all, highly recommend this one for any traveler.

Version 2.6.2 2013-29-09 5
 (Love this app!) Not sure why all the negative reviews, we use airbnb allllllll the time because we are constantly traveling and this app makes it so so easy to book, email, look up reservations etc.

Version 2.6.2 2013-29-09 1
 (Could be so much better) App seems geared more for guests booking than for hosts. I was on the road once and actually had to go to my son's dorm room to use his computer to change one of my settings to allow a guest to stay one night, as it was set to two and they couldn't book. It has very few settings for hosts beside the basics..and it should. Don't you want us to be able to accept more bookings while on the road? A company this big needs to adapt this app to allow hosts do more mobilely. And for heaven's sake would you please make an iPad version!

Version 2.6.2 2013-29-09 1
 (Crashing constantly) Like most other users, this version crashes every time I do more than look at listings. Surprised there hasn't been a new update yet

Version 2.6.2 2013-29-09 3
 (Pretty but crashes when favoriting) So pretty and easy to use but sadly crashes every time I try to ❤️ (favorite). Sad me.

Version 2.6.2 2013-29-09 2
 (Crashes when adding a favorite) Ever since the new release....it crashes whenever I try to add a favorite with my mobile device. Please fix it!!!

Version 2.6.2 2013-28-09 2
 (Keeps Crashing) Used to work fine, but now the app crashes every time I tap the heart to view my favorites. Please fix!!!

Version 2.6.1 2013-28-09 5
 (Love it) Love It Hands Down the best way to travel!!!

Version 2.6.2 2013-28-09 1
 (Help! I lost my faves) FYI 4s users- just updated this app on my phone - I do not have iOS7. Now every time I try to check my wish lists or add to my wish lists, the app crashes & closes. Search still works but I need the save menu too!

Version 2.6.2 2013-28-09 1
 (Crashing) Wish list can't be accessed, it crashes every them. Favorites can't be added. Clicking on a heart crashes the app every time.

Version 2.6.2 2013-28-09 3
 (App Crashes on Favorites) New version crashes every time heart icon (favorites) or Dream homes is tapped. Please allow download & replacement with old app

Version 2.6.2 2013-28-09 3
 (Great but it crashes) I love the app but this version crashes when I try to add something to my wishlist

Version 2.6.2 2013-27-09 3
 (Love Airbnb, not so much the app) I love being a host for airbnb, but being a user of their mobile app is a different story. There is so much you can do on the website that can't be done on your phone. The most frustrating is that I don't get notifications for inquiries and messages as they happen. I have to rely on my email notifications, then go to the app, and then look at my inbox where it shows I have notifications once I have to refresh any number of times. This is not a new problem to the app for me, but I sure hoped the latest update would fix it. I was wrong. :/

Version 2.6.2 2013-27-09 3
 (Crashing) Browsing is fine, looks good, and is mostly easy to use (though I'd like more freedom in positioning to the price sliders) but the app crashes when I hit the heart button next to a listing. I'm experiencing this with iOS 6.1.3.

Version 2.6.1 2013-26-09 1
 (Constantly crashing with new update) Fail :( Try again, I love this app, but something is messed up with latest update.

Version 2.6.1 2013-26-09 5
 (Awesome!!!) Absolutely live Airbnb! Stayed at great place in Amsterdam and found another excellent deal in Paris! Way better than staying in tiny hotel rooms!!!!

Version 2.6.2 2013-26-09 1
 (Airbnb! You rock... Your app needs some help.) First off... Where's the iPad app? Bizarre. Second, the iPhone app does not function the way it needs to for it to be a stand alone tool. In todays gadget world, you need each of your devices to be able to access the same content as simply and seamlessly as possible. This is not the case with your app. It is unfortunate as your business is stellar, the idea is perfect, and the service is beyond what I could have thought it to be. Upgrade the iPhone app to the 21st Century with a Universal iOS app that handles the same tasks that the website does and we are solid!

Version 2.6.1 2013-26-09 5
 (Great app) Fantastic tool. I love it

Version 2.6.1 2013-26-09 5
 (Excellent Tool) Overall, Wonderful App! Was able to book with no problems and usually had responses within a 24 hr period. Great way to communicate with the host, as well. Had only one quirk, one individual has yet to respond to my request or email. Individuals that list their properties and do not respond can create a huge headache for the guest. Job well done with using AIRBNB app! 6+ stars!

Version 2.6.1 2013-24-09 5
 (Great way to find renters and accommodations) I have used Airbnb both as a host and as a guest and I have found the system to be extraordinarily helpful in both capacities. Whether it was a last minute room in Munich or a beach vacation home for a group of 11, Airbnb was the best way to go.

Version 2.6.1 2013-23-09 3
 (Useful. Opinions.) It would be much nicer if cleaning & airbnb fees were included at first sight, it's SUCH a killjoy when the total is calculated. Also, all member pictures should be visible in the app.

Version 2.6.1 2013-22-09 5
 (Love!) This app is amazingggg! Without a doubt one of the greatest traveling aids I have ever encountered! Have thoroughly enjoyed my Airbnb experiences!!

Version 2.6.1 2013-21-09 5
 (User face a lil weak) The idea itself is genius. The app has a few things that need to be tweaked, but you can easily remedy any inconvenience with the web page. Overall super easy and understandable.

Version 2.6.1 2013-20-09 5
 (Love it!) As a host AND a guest.. Very convenient. I've met great people that I ordinarily wouldn't have met and the convenience of this app makes it easy to manage my site when away from my home computer

Version 2.6.1 2013-18-09 4
 (Wonderful App!) Wonderful app, love the idea, love the personal feeling rather than staying in a hotel. Only thing I wish was different was that people actually respond in a timely manner. I have lost multiple reservations because of no responses. Would be nice if it was linked to email as well.

Version 2.6.1 2013-18-09 4
 (great travel guide...) Nice app to use when traveling. The informatiion is clear and the use is very easy to understand.

Version 2.6.1 2013-17-09 5
 (This app rocks!) Easy to use   And you can't beat the price of lodging in the best parts of any city.

Version 2.6.1 2013-17-09 5
 (Good app) Useful application. Amazing way to travel for a reasonable price

Version 2.6.1 2013-17-09 5
 (Nice app) I like it!

Version 2.6.1 2013-17-09 4
 (Used it twice in one trip) Works as advertised. Saved money and had good experiences. Easy with credit card interface. W other services I've had to pay cash upon arrival and its kinda unnerving.

Version 2.6.1 2013-17-09 4
 (<3) Love love love this app!

Version 2.6.1 2013-16-09 5
 (Excellent) Awesome app although sometimes I wish it was similar to the website but not a big deal.

Version 2.6.1 2013-16-09 5
 (Air BNB love) We have used air bnb twice now and it is the best!!! We have met very nice people and stayed in some lovely lovely places!!!

Version 2.6.1 2013-15-09 4
 (Usefull step before you reserve) 1.We love airbnn!!!...we sugest before pushing Reserve-to contact the person and wait for his reply with confirmation about availibility and only then reserve;)

As if you push reserve without "verification"-your Visa account will be "blocked" for some time(in our case-2 weeks)...and if you "reserve" couple times..."blocked money" could make your visa "empty" and you could not use it (unless you put more money).

2.also would be nice to pay in cash-upon arriving...same as with booking.com -you make reservation with VISA (no money blocked) and pay in cash or credit card upon arriving;)

Version 2.6.1 2013-15-09 4
 (Improving all the time) The airbnb app was a little shaky at first but it's obvious they have been putting steady effort into making it more and more user friendly for hosts and travelers alike. I use it daily and fine the design, layout and UI far above most travel apps on the market.

Version 2.6.1 2013-15-09 3
 (Wish list) Well, every time I add a home to my wish list on my computer it no longer shows up on the app. I have to delete and re-install the app in order for it to reappear. Very frustrating!!

Version 2.6.1 2013-15-09 5
 (Great App) This makes traveling so much easier, the people seem great too!  Nice places

Version 2.6.1 2013-13-09 4
 (iPad app please) Love this app, just booked my first place so have yet to know how that turns out but it was very easy to do.  However we need an iPad app.  I use my iPad for my travels rather than my phone.  When can we expect an iPad version?

Version 2.6.1 2013-11-09 5
 (Makes me want to travel everyday!) Best app ever for travel accommodations. I have used it for 4 trips now and there aren't enough stars for how I feel.

Version 2.6.1 2013-11-09 5
 (Great app & service) I do really love Airbnb! Thank you so much for such a great tool for shrinking the world!

Version 2.6.1 2013-11-09 4
 (Needs a little more...) I love airbnb.  And I really like the airbnb app.  It doesn't have the same functionality of the airbnb website but it makes my life easier to deal with requests for my airbnb listing at any time anywhere.   I am confident improvements will be made to make the experience closer to the website.  And, I am happy to test the app and provide feedback.

Version 2.6.1 2013-11-09 5
 (Manage my listing from anywhere) I use AirBnB when I travel and have LOVED the places I've stayed and the people I've met - and I also have a listing on AirBnB that I manage with ease on the app from anywhere. Thanks AirBnB!

Version 2.6.1 2013-10-09 5
 (Travel and hosting LOVE) We've been hosting with this app for the last couple months and each update improves significantly. We are able to manage our hosting and browse travels with ease. We love the app and know it will just keep getting better and better as the company keeps growing!

Version 2.6.1 2013-10-09 5
 (Amazing convenience, great service) Great app. Immediate notifications of messages with owners. Easy record of correspondence.

Version 2.6.1 2013-09-09 5
 (Revolutionary app!) Changes the way I travel- incredible and easy to use!

Version 2.6.1 2013-09-09 5
 (great app for traveling) use this during my road trip gave so many nice places to stay , works great

Version 2.6.1 2013-09-09 5
 (Awesome app) Awesome app!!!! Greatly recommend!

Version 2.6.1 2013-08-09 5
 (Great app and great options for unique travel experience) Like

Version 2.6.1 2013-08-09 5
 (How simple, how perfect, how better to live?) The app, finally improved over a rather stodgy version beforehand, helps bring to my fingers the very literal- rest of the world. A devotee, sadly unpaid, for Airbnb that I am, I use this app to preach the world of sharing, as well as what I consider a much more pure version of traveling. 
The reviews make it so much more reliable to select a location, but through whatever arm twisting employed by Airbnb corporate, the pictures now are better, reflecting a move towards actual "good" photography and no longer grainy out of focus cell phone snaps.
Couple that with a more stable app and you are ready to explore no matter where you find yourself. I hope in future versions there's a tie in somehow to some sort of "time out" style guide for locals. Because now with this new app, you're that much closer to being a local yourself!

Version 2.6.1 2013-07-09 5
 (Proprietors) Terrific app! Allows us to respond promptly to inquiries and stay in touch with our guests before, during, and after their stay.

Version 2.6.1 2013-07-09 5
 (Easy to use) Everything on the computer version is here!

Version 2.6.1 2013-07-09 4
 (Good version of app) Is pretty easy to figure out and has almost all features of website. Good show.

Version 2.5.5 2013-06-09 3
 (favorites lists do not update) the app is ok for upcoming trips, but not at all for booking.  saved listings are not updating to the app, so it's useless for getting to them quickly.  love the service, just not this app.  if you want us to be able to use it on the go: while traveling, get it together please!

Version 2.6.1 2013-06-09 4
 (Awesome) App works just as nicely as the website, well close enough. The only thing I seem not to be able to do with the app is work on extending reservations. Great for leaving feedback. Have so issues with it updating new content but that might be a server issue with the cell service.

Version 2.6.1 2013-05-09 4
 (Brilliant) Brilliant app. Minus 1 star because pre entering travel dates doesn't correctly filter out booked listings.

Version 2.6.1 2013-05-09 5
 (The most convenient way to travel and host) Love the company, love the app, and love how easy and fun it's made traveling. Airbnb has really ironed out any bugs they had in previous versions of the app and I have no complaints with this one. Cheers to revolutionizing the world of travel!

Version 2.6.1 2013-05-09 1
 (has some bugs) service is a good concept but the app has some problems. it doesnt seem to sync wishlists between the app and web site, or there is a delay. also, on many occasions i will search with a specified date range, and airbnb will show a low rate that is not accurate--it should automatically show you a final quote divided by nights excluding fees. also, there should be a way text message listing owners because sometimes theyre unresponsive--this could be carried out through the apl without revealing their phone numbers. and there should be a required criterion for listings that specifies minimum advance notice of a stay, so you dont risk getting declined if youre booking spontaneously. and there need to be more amenitiea requirements like on the site. oh, and there needs to be a push notification for guests as well as listing owners.

Version 2.6.1 2013-04-09 4
 (Love) Unique ideas, great layout. Love the themes. Don't always like the fees :/

Version 2.6.1 2013-04-09 5
 (Airbnb) Love it. Been such a lovely way to meet new people of different and similar interests.

Version 2.6.1 2013-04-09 2
 (App Leaves Much To Be Desired) I really hate that I can't filter my options by cancellation policy. I absolutely do not want a place with a strict or moderate cancellation policy. Please give me an update that lets me filter those out!

Version 2.6.1 2013-03-09 4
 (Amazing UX!) So deep yet so simple to make such complicated transations and arrangements.

Version 2.6.1 2013-02-09 4
 (Great service, app is almost there!) Airbnb is amazing. It's changed the way I travel. I give airbnb 10 stars out of 5. The app is awesome for travelers. It's too bad that it isn't as good for the hosts. The app is missing some key functionalities found on the website. This makes it impossible to manage reservations on iPads or iPhones. It's close, but we need another go at it. Honestly, the app should have any functionality that is a requirement for the search algorithm. That's the hurdle for an all-star Airbnb app. The service itself is amazing.

Version 2.6.1 2013-01-09 5
 (Great idea) So far so goid

Version 2.6.1 2013-01-09 4
 (Better than ANY Hotel Website!) AirBnB is a necessity for any traveller/tourist, whether you travel every month, or once every 6 years!

As for the iPhone app itself, it's a great little app, but it is "little", compared to the website, in that it's difficult to navigate, and WAAAY oversimplified. Most mobile apps are starting to get too "dumbed down", to the point where they're becoming far too tedious to navigate, and sadly, this app, which is one of the best business ideas of our modern day, is using this trend...

The single-most way to improve the UI (in my opinion) is by having results pre-load, before you get to the last ones.

Version 2.6.0 2013-31-08 5
 (Beautiful app) Well designed and simple to use.  Love the emphasis on large photos...makes me want to travel more

Version 2.6.1 2013-31-08 5
 (Amazing service) I recommend everybody who is traveling and staying in different cities a lot!!!

Version 2.6.0 2013-31-08 5
 (The Best) AirBnB is the best, was planning a long trip and ended up booking the majority of it from here!! Best App ever for travel!

Version 2.6.1 2013-30-08 1
 (Worst experience imaginable) I used airbnb to make a reservation in Miami. When my girlfriend and I land and get to the property excited to start our vacation we find that not only is our host not responding to calls or emails, the toilet isn't working and the room isn't cleaned. If that weren't enough, the power to the apartment goes out a few hours in and until we checked out in disgust twelve hours later still hasn't been turned back on. The property manager informed us that the power was off because our host had not paid any of his last bills. 

We understandably went to the website for a help contact number and started a claim. Or at least we tried to. We called four different times to speak to a claim manager so that we could get our money back and book a different hotel. Over twelve hours later and still no updates. This is with several "urgent" notations. I guess if you don't stress urgency they may get back to you within the decade.

I will never use this service again and I will vehemently persuade others to stay away.

Version 2.6.1 2013-30-08 4
 (So far so good) Clean, searchable and great UI.

Version 2.6.1 2013-30-08 5
 (Great app. Clean, simple and legit.) I booked a trip in a matter of minutes!  Love love love Airbnb!!

Version 2.6.1 2013-30-08 4
 (I just started using this fabulous site!) Ok, I just started using this site less than a week ago and I already have one two day booking! Guests and hosts are pre-verified and they are both reviewed and come with references.  I love it.  And  $1,000,000 of insurance is supplied by AirBnB.  Anyway, I look forward to making a little extra money here and there through this fabulous site,

Version 2.6.1 2013-30-08 5
 (Review) The best site for vacation rentals! Nobody can ever improve on that!

Version 2.6.1 2013-28-08 4
 (Very good) Great app great service

Version 2.6.1 2013-28-08 2
 (New version won't download to my iPhone) Went to update the app. It starts to download and a 1/3 of the way through it stops and I get a prompt to try again later. "Try again later" is now on day two and still no success.

Version 2.6.1 2013-28-08 5
 (Best app ever!) So fun to browse and super easy to use. I'm a huge fan of this app!

Version 2.6.1 2013-28-08 4
 (Great but...) I use this app everyday managing my properties. My only complaint is the itinerary needs to note the amount of guests coming for the reservation,  so I know how many towels to have out or whether or not I need them to pay more. I'd also like to be able to see my reviews as they come so I don't have to login on a computer.  Just two pieces I hope their dev team considers.

Version 2.6.1 2013-28-08 5
 (Perfect app) Perfect for last minute reservations!

Version 2.6.1 2013-28-08 5
 (:)) Great App

Version 2.6.1 2013-27-08 4
 (The only travel app you need) Fast, easy to use and responsive.

Version 2.6.1 2013-27-08 5
 (Easy and convenient!) Super easy way to handle your business no matter where you are! Just love this app!!

Version 2.6.1 2013-27-08 5
 (Go Airbnb or just go home.) I don't know how I ever traveled before Airbnb?! If you're like me and suffer from an incurable travel lust, this app is priceless.  In the times that I've used it, I've stayed in great apartments in good neighborhoods off the beaten path.

Version 2.6.1 2013-26-08 2
 (Good Idea, but...) The idea of this app is brilliant... however, I have a serious problem with listers not responding to messages when you're trying to book a property. It has cost me several times to book a hotel due to lister inaccessability. The folks at Airbnb need to flush these people because it does reflect on their credibility. Sorry!

Version 2.6.0 2013-25-08 5
 (So far so good) I started to book through airbnb on my trip to Sri Lanka, so far I have found what seem to be nice places at a very reasonable price. I was so impressed I started hosting and within a few days my first guest came. A really nice couple stopping on their way home to Houston coming from Asia. This is so easy to use and the money I get from hosting may just cover the places I am staying in hosts abodes on my trip, a win win situation.

Version 2.6.0 2013-25-08 1
 (App Crashes :() Really irritated cuz I found an App I love and I can't use it? I want to post 5 stars!! Please Fix.

Version 2.5.6 2013-25-08 5
 (Awesome app, made our trip 5+ stars) This app is easy to use and let me find a place where I wanted to be and within the price range that I wanted to be in.  Took a little bit to get used to the concept but I'm a user for life and won't  be booking hotels anymore when I've got this awesome app!

Version 2.6.0 2013-24-08 1
 (Very Limited) The lowest "max" price I can enter is $114!  Say what?!!  On top of that silliness, the app won't let you filter by price.  So you have to scroll and scroll and scroll... Seriously lame.

Version 2.5.5 2013-24-08 5
 (Every trip we plan) This app is a must

Version 2.6.0 2013-24-08 3
 (Total price not showing) i like the app, but full price never showing & if i want to book its just loading for ever

Version 2.6.0 2013-24-08 5
 (Wonderful!!) Great service and useful reviews! Love the communication with space providers via airbnb, and the easily viewable pictures.

Version 2.6.0 2013-23-08 4
 (Love the app!) Love this app! Makes hosting on airbnb so much easier and convenient. Thank you!

Version 2.6.0 2013-23-08 5
 (Legit) Great app. Helped with finding lodging for Outside Lands the night before the festival. Great community

Version 2.6.0 2013-23-08 4
 (Wishlist problem) Can't see all my wishlists!!!

Version 2.6.0 2013-22-08 4
 (Works well) Good travel app

Version 2.6.0 2013-22-08 5
 (Great simple effective) Simple, easy, effective wonderful app.

Version 2.6.0 2013-22-08 5
 (Great app!) Easy to use and makes managing your listing a breeze!

Version 2.6.0 2013-22-08 1
 (can't add reservation to passbook) latest version doesn't let me add a reservation to passbook. it just scrolls to the house rules. otherwise love this app.

Version 2.6.0 2013-21-08 4
 (❤) This app is very easy to use and safe.

Version 2.6.0 2013-21-08 4
 (Great stuff!) Love this app and the entire program in general.

Version 2.5.6 2013-20-08 5
 (Highly recommend) We have rented many vacation rentals before. It is our preferred and recommended way to travel. This was our first experience booking on airbnb. Overall, it was fabulous. The nice thing about this site is the customer service, or middle man. They are working for both the host and guest. They are impartial and can therefore provide comfort that they will not take "sides". We did have to move from our initial rental into a new one because the amenities promised were not provided. Although it took a few days to get back to us after booking with another airbnb property (which is understandable) we did receive a full refund from the first place. My husband and I are planning at least one international vacation in the next year and we will absolutely be renting from this site.

Version 2.6.0 2013-19-08 4
 (Four Stars) Useful, no issues.

Version 2.6.0 2013-18-08 5
 (Love love love this app) Haha it is more then I can say!!! So Fab

Version 2.6.0 2013-18-08 5
 (One of the best UIs out there) Beautiful interface and smooth flow. Other services have a lot to learn on how to cater the desktop experience to the native app.

Version 2.6.0 2013-18-08 1
 (Not enough filters) Trying to find specific criteria is extremely difficult with only bed and bath number filters. Need bed size, children friendly, kitchen use access...etc etc etc. Completely useless for my needs.

Version 2.6.0 2013-18-08 5
 (Convenient) Easy to use, convenient, great way to reference messages while booking a place and update your profile etc.

Version 2.6.0 2013-16-08 5
 (Awesome. Just perfect.) I love the immediate notifications, the pictures, user experience, ahh. 
Just amazing. 

So easy to use and the payment way is so comfy. I never even use the website. Do everything on my phone!!! So easy! Thanks Airbnb!!!

Version 2.6.0 2013-16-08 5
 (Love it!) Simple to use and so much better than hotels!!!

Version 2.6.0 2013-16-08 4
 (Great app, would like more management features) I would like to manage my listing better from the airbnb app. That the only negative, otherwise it's a 5 star app for rental hunters.

Version 2.6.0 2013-16-08 5
 (Like air bnb) Like air bnb

Version 2.6.0 2013-16-08 3
 (Eats battery and searching is limited) Love the Airbnb service, but the app could be refined. First, on my iPhone 4, it keeps the GPS engaged which will eat up your entire battery in half a day. Second, I wish there was an easier way to search for specific type of properties instead of by location. For example if I wanted to find a cabin to rent within a few hours of my city, that's hard to do. Third, when searching within a specific city, it intermingles results from cities nearby which makes it difficult to only look at that specific city's properties.

Version 2.6.0 2013-15-08 5
 (Great place) Amazing website

Version 2.6.0 2013-14-08 4
 (The future of travel) So great.

Version 2.6.0 2013-14-08 5
 (Best) Awesome app

Version 2.5.6 2013-14-08 5
 (Love love love it!) Great app great company! I'm addicted.

Version 2.6.0 2013-13-08 5
 (Great For Solo Female Travelers) I absolutely love AirBnb, I have had nothing but wonderful hosts for every place that I have visited. As a solo female traveler I feel very comfortable and safe booking rooms on this site. Also, I love that I have the opportunity to go beyond the touristy hotels and really learn the places that I visit because the hosts are usually locals of the area. Super easy layout to book rooms and you've saved me a lot of money. Thanks AirBnB for helping me see the world!

Version 2.6.0 2013-13-08 5
 (Great Service) We have been using Airbnb as hosts and guests for a couple months and we are loving it!

Version 2.5.6 2013-13-08 5
 (Absolutely amazing experience!) Enabled us to make some extra cash to travel.

Version 2.6.0 2013-13-08 4
 (So helpful) I love Airbnb and this app is not only easy to use, it has become the primary way for me to manage my vacation rental. It is so helpful!

Version 2.6.0 2013-12-08 5
 (Must add) This app is phenomenal. I'm going to Europe this month and with this website I was able to book unbelievable places in different countries and cities.

Version 2.6.0 2013-12-08 5
 (Amazing app) Used it for the first time!! And will never use anything else ever again

Version 2.6.0 2013-11-08 4
 (Great design, and shedding glitches with every update) This app makes managing my AirBnB listings incredibly convenient. I would likely not participate in this site without it. Some glitches come up from time to time, and it will shut down without warning. But it still gets the job done when I need it to.

Version 2.5.6 2013-11-08 5
 (Perfect for traveling) This app is a must-have if traveling and staying at air BnB accommodations. So useful and makes it very convenient to communicate wit hosts.

Version 2.6.0 2013-11-08 5
 (Love it!) Great app for a great service!

Version 2.6.0 2013-11-08 5
 (Great App) So far so good

Version 2.6.0 2013-11-08 2
 (I cannot login with Facebook account) I use Facebook a lot to market my studio, I cannot login with Facebook account, it keeps giving me the server error message.  Please take a look!  Otherwise, it would have been a five app!

Version 2.6.0 2013-11-08 3
 (Good but limited) I think this app could be well more comprehensive.

Version 2.6.0 2013-10-08 5
 (Great company/ great app) Airbnb is a really well run company. The user interface of their website is easy to run manage and the app is no different. I manage 8 rental properties in Atlanta and I can use this app to manage all of my bookings mobiley. That's quite remarkable of you think about it.

Version 2.6.0 2013-09-08 1
 (Airbnb is stupid) No long support Passbook

Version 2.6.0 2013-09-08 4
 (Super easy way to organize thoughts) I use this app every day and love it. This version seems to crash on launch for me though. But once I open the app a second time, everything is fine.

Version 2.6.0 2013-09-08 5
 (Awesome and fun app to use!!!!) Love the app and its even more fun to make a wish list and share your favorite listings with friends to talk about over coffee, etc.

Version 2.6.0 2013-09-08 2
 (Seriously lacking) I don't know what app all of the five star reviewers are using, but it must not be the same as mine. You can't: save favorites (heart icon does not exist in app), drag $$ slider below $110 per night, and it's hard to drag anywhere at that, you can't filter by any amenities such as high speed Internet, pet friendly, laundry, etc, and all of the information on each listing is so basic as to be a waste of time. This is clearly a website that works best on a desktop or laptop. I give the mobile airbnb websites on phones, iPads and the app itself a combined 3 out of 10.

Version 2.6.0 2013-08-08 5
 (Great APP!) This app is great! It makes communicating with guests is made FAST and simple. Get it!

Version 2.6.0 2013-08-08 2
 (Not syncing properly) I am a host and this new version is NOT transferring property description.  Airbnb website also needs a troubleshooting contact point.  I had to phone to report the problem and the customer service person was not helpful at all with troubleshooting question

Version 2.6.0 2013-07-08 5
 (Great!!) Airbnb is great!

Version 2.6.0 2013-07-08 4
 (Great app) Great app but in the latest update the "add to passbook" button no longer works and shows "directions" instead (yes, just like the directions button below it). Please fix.

Version 2.6.0 2013-07-08 5
 (In love.) I am totally in love with this concept and app. So much cheaper than hotels and you can pay how you want for the most part ( debit card vs major credit card and the security deposit hold blah blah blah). 
I have traveled so much more and met some really cool connects on the way.

Version 2.6.0 2013-06-08 5
 (Perfect for serious travelers) What a great app and it is so nice to have on the fly. Works very well with my Passbook too and gives me a quick reference to pull from when in a hurry!!

Version 2.6.0 2013-06-08 5
 (Great App) Changes the way you travel, excellent App

Version 2.6.0 2013-05-08 4
 (iPad version, please!) Very well done on the iPhone... Now what I'd love would be a dedicated iPad version, much better for browsing places.

Version 2.6.0 2013-05-08 5
 (Amazing) A really great company and app, I used it for my entire summer to find prime locations to stay at!

Version 2.6.0 2013-05-08 5
 (Great app, great service) Really easy app to use and I love the layout

Version 2.6.0 2013-05-08 4
 (Love it!) I love AirBnB and I love this app! It's incredibly easy to use. I wish we were able to make changes to the Wish List via the app, but it's not a deal breaker. Highly recommend.

Version 2.6.0 2013-05-08 3
 (App needs to be improved.) Most of basic stuff can get done with this app, except 1) edit your ad, 2) alter daily rates, currency, or claim issues if you're a host. 

Developers should definitely make it work the same as the website.

Version 2.6.0 2013-04-08 1
 (Unable to complete verification) I would rate the app much higher except I was unable to complete the verification process (I could not verify my phone number, and all attempts to contact Airbnb were unsuccessful), therefor I was unable to complete the booking, and had to revert to other options.

P.S. I tried to use the web version to complete the process or contact Airbnb and and still no success.

Version 2.6.0 2013-04-08 5
 (Wonderfully brilliant.) Amazing.

Version 2.6.0 2013-04-08 2
 (Nice, but no prices listed) Good interface, but I can never see the price listed when I search for a place. Price shows up no problem when I use the mobile site

Version 2.5.6 2013-03-08 5
 (Perfect !) Are u friendly and have extra space at  your house ? Use Airbnb :)

Version 2.6.0 2013-03-08 5
 (Fantastic App!) I can run my entire rental from this app alone! It's so intuitive and easy to use. I thought I would have to use my desktop most of the time but after downloading this app I rarely find myself logging on from my home computer.

Version 2.6.0 2013-02-08 5
 (The best!) This app has been a true diamond on my new travel adventures! Love it! Thank you!

Version 2.6.0 2013-02-08 1
 (Lacking Features) Nice UI, but lacking the ability to filter by amenities.   That's really weak.   Missing that major feature makes this app almost unusable.

Version 2.5.6 2013-02-08 5
 (Awesome App and Fabulous Concept) Great job with this app!  It's really easy to use.

Version 2.6.0 2013-01-08 1
 (Non efficient app) I love airbnb. But I hate this app. I've been using airbnb to rent out my apartment when I travel which is every 2 months or so, and I like to be able to change the rate on my apartment to be competitive. It is next to impossible to change the rate on this app for certain days, and they never show you how much you could potentially get from an inquiry. I literally log in every time to the desktop version of airbnb on safari on my iPhone, it's much more user friendly even if a few more extra steps. I feel like people who wrote the 5 star reviews must not need to know the amount of $ a reservation can add up to or never change their price, or aren't actually people that use this app... Step up your game airbnb!

Version 2.5.6 2013-01-08 5
 (All-Timer) "This is the business of the year."
In quotes is the pre-text put in by apple or airbnb and I cannot disagree. This is my favorite business of the year. I have met awesome people, made money, and vacationed in Mexico on it. BUSINESS OF THE YEAR.

Version 2.6.0 2013-31-07 5
 (For on the Go) I really enjoy this app. It is easy to use and allowed me to communicate with the owner of the property where we were staying, since we didn't bring our laptop. I highly recommend this!

Version 2.5.6 2013-31-07 5
 (Airbnb: Makes For A Great Life) I love Airbnb! It was just what I was looking for when I decided to rent out my houses. I have met great people and it has helped me financially as well. I really appreciate the team behind Airbnb... They are great and helpful!

Version 2.6.0 2013-31-07 5
 (Ibra) Nice

Version 2.6.0 2013-31-07 5
 (Great app and useful) So good and awesome app

Version 2.6.0 2013-30-07 5
 (Easy to use) Love the interface.

Version 2.6.0 2013-30-07 5
 (Excellent business tool!) I LOVE AirBnB and I love this app.  I can run my entire little cottage rental business from this app. I also have a competitors app that I use from time to time but I find this app far superior.
It's also fast. Efficient. I love it!

Version 2.5.6 2013-30-07 5
 (Fabulous!) I love the mobile app! Works really well, kept all the reservation info handy for me. We rented a fabulous apartment with great owners. Excellent experience all the way around.

Version 2.5.6 2013-30-07 5
 (Airbnb is super) We LOVE Airbnb app. While traveling we could easily find hosts and a map showing where places were available. It is great!!

Version 2.5.6 2013-30-07 5
 (Superb!) An awesome app - try it for your next getaway - you won't regret it!

Version 2.5.6 2013-29-07 5
 (Airbnb) Simply great!

Version 2.5.6 2013-29-07 5
 (Every vacation with Airbnb!!) I already used airbnb few times and i was happy with an app as well as with the whole idea of renting places.
Happy to recommend!!

Version 2.5.6 2013-29-07 5
 (Awesome) Love love love this app. Totally easy to use and great to have with you when traveling.

Version 2.5.6 2013-29-07 3
 (AIRBNB) Have used this company many times to find great places to stay while on vacation but the app is missing a lot of features for hosting a place such as setting price.

Version 2.5.6 2013-28-07 1
 (app crashes when accepting a reservation) when attempting to update listing with new pix from an iOS device, you must take pix at that moment. no support for pix saved for uploading within app. are you listening airbnb?!

July 28, 2013 update: airbnb continues to ignore basic and common-sense bug and usability fixes with their iOS app! it's extremely frustrating, and despite repeated calls and discussions, no return phone calls to address or fix the issues. we are going to begin moving our listing to two competing services out of sheer frustration. airbnb: don't do anything to change, we know you won't anyway!

Version 2.5.6 2013-27-07 5
 (Airbnb, the way to go) Airbnb is a fantastic way to find accommodations when you travel. The app works well and is very consumer friendly.

Version 2.5.6 2013-27-07 5
 (Love) This is hands down my favorite app of all time!

Version 2.5.6 2013-27-07 5
 (Essential for Airbnb hosts) I use this all the time to respond to inquiries faster, set my calendar availability, approve instant bookings, etc.

Version 2.5.6 2013-27-07 5
 (Wonderful Way to Travel) Traveling alone or with company the AirBNB app makes traveling a breeze. Cheaper pricing than most hotels with all the ease of staying at home. Depending on your comfort level you can share a room, stay in a private room, or rent a whole place. The app even tells you if dogs are welcome! It is so easy to use and helpful!

Version 2.5.6 2013-26-07 5
 (Excellent App) Makes the already great AirBnB experience even better.  I would just suggest a better layout for the menu.  It's not overly confusing but could be better.

Version 2.5.6 2013-25-07 5
 (Great.) Highly visual, intuitive--just a great app and a great service. I DO feel like wish list functionality should be beefed up, and hey, why not a native iPad version!

Version 2.5.6 2013-24-07 4
 (I'll take it!) It's not as comprehensive as the online computer version. But it is fantastic enough to spend 2hrs at a time on planning your next spectacular trip

Version 2.5.6 2013-24-07 5
 (I use it more than the website!) I am a host and I use the app to manage everything. Even when I'm traveling people send me messages for reservation and I never miss it! There is a reason why my response rate is 100%!!
As a traveller too, I can find any accommodation on the road. Hardly any bugs!
The only thing I would want is to manage your calendar feature in the app as a host 

Great tool!

Version 2.5.6 2013-24-07 5
 (Making it better, yet) I love Airbnb, & the app makes using it even better. As a hostess, I know I am always available to respond thanks to this app!

Version 2.5.6 2013-23-07 5
 (Impressed) I've used AirBnb 4 times in the last 3 months. It's a great way to find MORE space for LESS money. I stayed in a 2-bedroom house in San Fran, less than a mile from the beach in the Sunset District, for less than a basic hotel room in the city. Great deals from great people. I'll be using this service again and again!

Version 2.5.6 2013-23-07 3
 (Not ideal for hosts but gets the job done) As a host, I wish my calendar was easier to view and access. Also, when I'm responding to messages, I need to be able to see the message I'm responding too. Often, a guest has several questions and ill have to copy what I have, go back to read the question, then return and paste my original response. Overall the app is super helpful, but doesn't feel like it was built for hosts first.

Version 2.5.6 2013-23-07 5
 (Best travel concept) This app is such a cool idea.
A really great way to connect with others and get insider tips on the area you are visiting from your host.
Super affordable way to travel; never feel ripped off by a hotel again!

Version 2.5.6 2013-23-07 5
 (Love airbnb!) The airbnb app is very easy to use and fast. It makes the business perfect. Thanks.

Version 2.5.6 2013-22-07 2
 (Update please) I've had several problems with iOS device on this app...
Once, I was in Germany and I decided to stay somewhere and for some reason not only it gave me the wrong address but it also didn't let me know about the extra fee since I was with my wife.
Than now I have an issue with notification center and it's not Apple problem like you've mentioned a few time. It doesn't save the settings on in your app where I wanna be notified on my iphone the second I get a message from somebody! And for that reason I've missed a few people!
Thanks for fixing it!

Version 2.5.6 2013-22-07 2
 (Looks Great? No Wait!) I couldn't find a way to click to cancel through the app. ( i could understand if it's because you want to protect again people using the app to find places and not paying for the hook up) BUT If you have booking remorse you still have to call someone to do it for you if you aren't near a computer and if you haven't gone to the place to check it out first, they will encourage you to do that. I'm sorry, with people padding their online reviews left and right these days I want to have the right to back out of a deal quickly if a place isn't quite what it's made out to be! ( I don't want to have to go there just to make sure it does in deed "smell of smoke and urine" as some two weeks older but now buried reviews stated) I ended up eating the booking because the place had a "flexible" but no short notice refunding policy... Makes we wonder how many other people may have run into similar situations... booked and canceled which then null and voids their right to review a place.

Version 2.5.6 2013-22-07 5
 (Lincoln/Ideal Apt 4 NYC) My husband and I just spent a week in this Brooklyn apt. next to Prospect Park,  across the street from a subway station. We rented a room from Lincoln/Phillip, and it was quiet, clean, & comfortable.  Lucille

Version 2.5.6 2013-22-07 4
 (Pretty Amazing!) The only reason this isn't a five-star review is for two reasons:
1) Ideally a rep would contact a new listing owner and give tips to get the most out of it and explain more on how to capitalize this opportunity. I feel lost and not sure if I'm doing it right. No bites on my listing. Is it price or verbiage? I don't know. 

2) There needs to be an Edit button on the photos page to pivot portrait style photos to landscape. The program does not allow for imported portrait style pics to be pivoted. Seems simple enough to solve on the back end. 

Otherwise, this concept is amazing.

Version 2.5.6 2013-21-07 5
 (I love Airbnb) After being diagnosed with cancer and being told I can't work, I was devastated. I found Airbnb and signed up it has saved me. Gave me the ability to support myself during kemo and next month surgery.  I love hosting people and i met the most awesome people. If it wasn't for Airbnb I don't know where I would be now.

Version 2.5.6 2013-21-07 3
 (Almost perfect!!) The app is almost there to perfection. It can handle basic reservation requests and approve or deny and basic messaging to the guest or host. However it's missing the following:
- ability for the host to call the guest from the app, I can only do this on full desktop version which is annoying when I'm out on the road. 
- no ability to adjust the price in my calendar
- no ability to adjust my profile description 

It's almost a home run app, but I guess it's better than nothing. For what one can do on the app its great! So thank you airbnb!

Version 2.5.6 2013-21-07 3
 (Where is the iPad version?) Seriously need iPad version.

Version 2.5.6 2013-19-07 5
 (Pure perfection) Very user friendly, and finds great deals! Very reliable too! 
My boyfriend and I were looking for a place together in TLV and were not the richest kids on the planet, it appears. When we found this app it made my life so much easier with finding the perfect place for us by the beach for a great price! These are amazing findings and I never thought it'd be this easy to pinpoint them. Now I can go about y traveling with the option of not pulling out thousands of dollars on a place to stay. Thanks airbenb!

Version 2.5.6 2013-18-07 5
 (Best way to travel) Best way to travel for my family. Will always check AirBnB first!

Version 2.5.6 2013-17-07 5
 (Only Way to Travel) I've been an AirBNB host in Beverly Hills, CA for 6 years. The hundreds of guests I've had the pleasure of hosting has enriched my life immensely. I have gotten to know people from every continent..... Privileged travelers that want a more personal experience, young budget-minded travelers, honeymooners, future Angelino's wanting a home base while seeking their new place to live, business travelers that can't stand the thought of one more hotel, medical patients recuperating after coming to Cedars-Sinai for treatment from one of their many fine doctors.  There are couples, straight, gay, seniors, first-time travelers, young lovers. I look forward to a trip to Spain & Portugal this year to use AirBNB as a guest. I can't wait!

Version 2.5.6 2013-16-07 3
 (Null) Everything is null and 0$ in iOS 7 beta 1,2,and 3

Version 2.5.6 2013-16-07 4
 (Very useful for most actions!) I love AirBnB and really like the app. Two things I wish we're available: profile editing and viewing past reservations. I talk this service up everywhere I travel and I'd love to be able to show people photos and descriptions of places I've already stayed.

Version 2.5.6 2013-16-07 5
 (Airbnb) Love this app. Love that we found it through a friend and we can't wait to use it again in upcoming trips!!  Our experience in Austin, TX was out of this world awesome

Version 2.5.6 2013-15-07 5
 (Amazing app) My wife and I are traveling through Europe and this app has saved us hours of searching and loads of money. Great, intuitive app. I like that there are multiple ways to find a place, especially with the map & pins.

Version 2.5.6 2013-15-07 5
 (Wonderful site, now with wonderful app!) Airbnb is my go-to site for vacation housing.. Now the app makes it easier for me to view offerings while I'm on the go.. That's a win in my book!

Version 2.5.6 2013-15-07 4
 (Fun!) Awesome!

Version 2.5.6 2013-15-07 1
 (App does not work!!) I love Airbnb but I have iPhone 5 and the app has not worked for some time time now. :(

Version 2.5.6 2013-15-07 1
 (Crash!) Ever since I installed(and keep reinstalling) the newest version, all it does is crash. Very irritated!!!

Version 2.5.6 2013-13-07 5
 (Refer friends) I refer everyone who shares their upcoming travel plans to airbnb. I'm a big fan!!

Version 2.5.6 2013-12-07 5
 (Great app!) App makes it easy to find places to stay and has tons of information about the hosts and reviews on the properties in easy to find and simply presented.

Version 2.5.6 2013-12-07 5
 (Excellent) I believe it is a great app and a great idea similar to Facebook!

Version 2.5.6 2013-12-07 5
 (Great app!) Easy to navigate and very useful. I will never use VRBO again!

Version 2.5.6 2013-11-07 5
 (So convenient.) I love it! Seeing options around the world with my phone? Doesn't get any better than that!

Version 2.5.6 2013-11-07 5
 (The best) Love The Properties they offer, their customer  service is exceptional, we have used air bnb twice and could not have been more satisfied!! I have been recommending this site to everyone I know is going on vacation!

Version 2.5.6 2013-03-07 5
 (Great app) Love this app

Version 2.5.6 2013-03-07 5
 (This is it!) This is just what I've been looking for! A smooth, easy,way to,rent our lake house

Version 2.5.6 2013-03-07 5
 (Perfect) Easy to use. Good people. Good times :)

Version 2.5.6 2013-02-07 4
 (Great app) Just completed my first airbnb stay. It was great. Not sure how to leave feedback for my host with the app, but communication with app was great.

Version 2.5.6 2013-02-07 4
 (Awesome app) This app is awesome. As a host, I use it often to keep track of my calendar, manage reservations and help others find a place to stay. I wish you could change the price of your place using the app, and I wish the instructions were more clear on how to sync this app with your phone's calendar.

Version 2.5.6 2013-02-07 5
 (The best !) Never use another travel app to find accommodation !

Version 2.5.6 2013-01-07 5
 (Great) I travel constantly and often. App is well done and the service is a lifesaver.

Version 2.5.6 2013-01-07 5
 (Awesome) Incredible service made better through this easy to use app. Makes traveling a breeze, as well as more economical.

Version 2.5.3 2013-01-07 4
 (Useful Rent by Owner App) If you like renting places from individuals. AirBNB is the best resource.

Version 2.5.5 2013-01-07 5
 (Airbnb) I used the app to arrange for all my lodgings while traveling in Europe, it works great& I was able to use the wifi on my Verizon  phone in Europe to use the app

Version 2.5.6 2013-01-07 3
 (Great service but app a little glitchy) Airbnb is a great service and I really enjoy using the app to search out places to stay, but I had difficulty making a reservation. The app was telling me my requested dates weren't available (they were) and that they didn't take discover (they do).   I finally ended up getting on my computer to make the reservation itself.

Version 2.5.6 2013-01-07 5
 (Great App, Great Concept) My teen daughter and I just returned from a 3 week road trip in which we used Airbnb exclusively instead of hotels. 

The app has consistently worked for me. I can easily find what I need, communicate with hosts, look at pictures, maps, reviews, and get my needs met whether I'm planning a trip ahead of time or on the road and needing a place for that night. 

The only change I'd suggest for this great App would be to have a filter for things other than how many bedrooms and bathrooms I need on a given night. I'd like to be able to filter which amenities are critical to me (ie Which of these houses available tonight have air conditioning? Anyone have a hot tub?) without reading each one and manually searching for Amenities. 

Aside from that- perfection!

Version 2.5.6 2013-30-06 3
 (Crashes) Love Airbnb but the app crashes constantlyEspecially when logging on through fb. I then want to sign up separately because i think it might be crashing due to the facebook app but Airbnb won't let me create a Airbnb only log-in. Making this flexible might be nice. Once on however, the app is phenomenal!

Version 2.5.6 2013-30-06 5
 (Good times) Thanks to airbnb, we have had some of the best trips, ever!  I really enjoy the comfort and privacy as apposed to a hotel.  Don't get me wrong, there is a time and a place...

Version 2.5.6 2013-30-06 2
 (Take it or leave it) The world would keep spinning without this app. I LOVE Airbnb, but the app is basically useless. This app is probably better for guests than hosts. Managing your listings using the app is difficult at best, sometimes impossible. It gives you an "inbox" but.... I already get those emails on my phone. It lets you see what reservations you have coming up but that's about it. You can't set your pricing or change your pictures, and for some strange reason when I look at the app my listing says "$125/month" when it's actually "$125/night". Whatever. I manage by waiting till I get home and going on my computer. Anyways, love you Airbnb but you can do better.

Version 2.5.6 2013-30-06 5
 (Hi) Goooooood

Version 2.5.6 2013-29-06 5
 (Great!) Great!

Version 2.5.6 2013-29-06 4
 (Great App!) We just joined Airbnb as hosts and having this easy to use App on my iPhone makes it fast and easy to respond to guest requests. I only wish It could do more: like block dates on my calendar or edit my profile. But I love it!

Version 2.5.6 2013-29-06 4
 (Great App, but its not enhanced for the iPad.) Airbnb offers a great and innovative service, this is a great app also. Anyway, an iPad version with a more interactive interface would definitely make the difference and enhance the user experience!

Version 2.5.6 2013-28-06 5
 (Life saver.) If you are a chic traveling alone this is your new bestie.

Version 2.5.6 2013-28-06 5
 (App worked great for all my needs) I don't know if this speaks more to the app OR to the service itself... but I had an excellent experience recently with using this app!  I was able to download the app in one day, find the property, book my reservation, and check-in to that property - all in/on the same evening!

No matter what you're looking for… I recommend at least downloading this app and giving it to try!!  I can't find anything negative to say; at least not yet.

Version 2.5.6 2013-28-06 5
 (Does good job) Best of all similar apps industry

Version 2.5.6 2013-27-06 5
 (Awesome) Very useful and fun. I am in the military and get sent to many different places. This app allows me to discover great places to stay and the prices are unbeatable! Must have app!

Version 2.5.6 2013-25-06 4
 (Useful for booking on the go.) It's great for booking places on the go. Easy to use.

Version 2.5.6 2013-25-06 4
 (Great for business!) I love this app, I use it to host my apartment. Its great since I'm always on the go, I can receive and respond to potential guests immediately! Only downfall, a few features are missing from the app that are only available on desktop version:
1. I cannot see the potential income I would make off of each reservation request in my Inbox. This is still only available in desktop version.
2. I cannot change price based on day (ex: making Thanksgiving weekend a few dollars more) using the app. 
     These may seem like miniscule complaints but they are important to me and would smoothen out my day. If I could avoid altogether finding a desktop computer to accomplish these tasks, it would save me a lot of time!
    If these things get fixed, I'll give 5 stars!

Version 2.5.6 2013-25-06 5
 (San Fransicso) (Cont'd)
From the first time I contacted Nicholas about his place, I knew I could rely in the best place. Followup with him was direct, airbnb was there to meet and show the apt, it was exactly as represented, luxurious, elegant, bathroom lovely, and kitchen with a washer/dryer! My contact was always available in case of questions, and the stay was excellent.
It is located in the 7th three doors from Rue Cler, a very fashionable street (4 blocks long) full of restaurants, flower shops, grocery stores, dry cleaners,  boutiques and everything you could possibly wish for! Cafe Central and Le Petite Cler became the favorite morning and evening stops, and it is an easy walk to San Germaine past Invalides, or up Ave Bosquet to The Champs Élysées !
You can continue from both locations to the Louvre, walk to Angelina's for Tea, and Notre Dame, with shopping at Galleries Lafayette!
The apt is walking distance to anything. 20 minutes in any direction and quiet at night unlike the 6th arrondissement around San Germaine.
Enjoy this apt, I will again!

Version 2.5.6 2013-25-06 5
 (Great service, great app!) This app is a great way to access the Airbnb service, including new things they've added to aid in emergency situations.  Wish there was an iPad version, but the iPhone version scales up nicely regardless.

Version 2.5.5 2013-25-06 5
 (Superb) My husband and I have has amazing experiences and met cool people because we use Airbnb for all of our travel! Always will! I love this website! Just wish I could buy stock in it!

Version 2.5.6 2013-24-06 4
 (Totally awesome!!!) This is definitely an awesome App!! If you love to travel, you need Airbnb!!!

Version 2.5.6 2013-24-06 2
 (No price) Must be a glitch with the app- not one place I searched for in NYC listed any price cost.
Also, a nice addition to the filter, "pet friendly".

Version 2.5.6 2013-24-06 5
 (This app keeps getting better) Awesome app + great service + unique places = fun

Version 2.5.6 2013-23-06 5
 (Awesome) I think the air bnb app is a great resource for traveling people - especially for long term stays. I think it helps real people earn extra income, and other real people save money. I will definitely try to use this app next time I'm traveling

Version 2.5.6 2013-23-06 1
 (Buyer beware) I've used AirBnB twice & had excellent experiences. However a close friend of mine had an absolutely terrible experience. He booked a private apt months in advance. Less than a week before the reservation the apt owner emailed him to say he'd finally gotten around to googling him as a potential guest & since he didn't approve of my friend's profession, he was canceling the reservation. Leaving my friend in a mad dash to find a hotel last minute. The app is great when people act well, but they take no responsibility for the bad business practices of the people they allow on their app. So buyer beware!

Version 2.5.6 2013-23-06 5
 (I'm addicted) Love this app.  Have two trips planned and a huge wish list.

Version 2.5.6 2013-21-06 5
 (AirBnB rocks!) This is the easiest way to sublet your place to vacationers that you can actually screen first.  Highly recommend this service to anyone to wants to make a little extra money or anyone who is traveling.

Version 2.5.6 2013-21-06 5
 (Good App for traveler) Really good apps for a travelers all around the world

Version 2.5.6 2013-20-06 5
 (Great app) This website is the best and most secure to rent out your place

Version 2.5.6 2013-20-06 3
 (Needs more features) The app is missing several important features that appear on the main website. When responding to a request from a potential guest, you cannot see the total amount of dollars for the stay. If you're writing a message, and need to save it to get back to it later, the app doesn't allow you to do so. 

Also, if you want to make any modifications to your profile or the property listing, you're not able to do so through the app.

I hope they continue working on this app to improve it and make it more user-friendly.

Version 2.5.3 2013-19-06 5
 (Extremely useful) This app has all the features of the airbnb website scaled down to phone size. I've used this app several times while traveling and it's never failed me.

Version 2.5.6 2013-19-06 5
 (Great so far!) So thankful I found this app! Finding places that I would have never seen on a web search!

Version 2.5.6 2013-19-06 5
 (So amazing. What great options. Better than a hotel) I love this app and cannot imagine going somewhere now and staying at a hotel. So many cool and unique places with so much charm and usually less expensive than a hotel. Several mind blowing properties. I suddenly got the travel bug. ✈💺🚁⛵🚤🚂🚢🌅🌄💗😜😍

Version 2.5.6 2013-18-06 5
 (My favorite travel app) I used airbnb for a road trip across country and I'll never use another app.

Version 2.5.6 2013-18-06 5
 (Great app) Very efficient and fast

Version 2.5.6 2013-18-06 4
 (It's not you, it's me...) Admittedly, I am not the most app-savvy kid on the planet. I felt a little hung-out-to-dry after I hit "confirm." I wish there was a little more hand-holding through the process. As I write this, I'm waiting to find out if I a.) did the process correctly; b.) will in fact be staying at the place I charged $206 to my card (possibly twice); and c.) if I need to keep looking for accommodation. After I charged my card, the screen did not take me to a confirmation page, which seems like a glitch to me. Also, I'm guessing (hoping) that since I theoretically booked a place, it's no longer listed. This means however that I can't contact my prospective host. That being said, airbnb is a pretty great service. Very handy for travelers. I await word from my hosts...

 (Love Airbnb) The best site ever !

Version 2.5.5 2013-15-06 5
 (Feels like HOME away from home) I spend ours on airbnb looking for vacay spots, i love browsing the diversity of it!

Version 2.5.5 2013-15-06 5
 (AirBNB ROCKS!) I've used it four times now both for business & pleasure trips and I'll never look at hotels first again. The app is awesome, and nearly as complete as the site (I normally prefer the full site view) and I even found a private message from a host in the app that I never noticed on the site. Wish I could send referrals from it, but that's a paltry issue.

Version 2.5.5 2013-14-06 5
 (Awesome!) Such great prices and such a good range of places

Version 2.5.5 2013-14-06 3
 (Ugh!) It keeps kicking me out of the app! When ever I'm in the heart of looking, it does that. Then I would have to start all over again. FRUSTRATING!!! Please fix.

Version 2.5.5 2013-14-06 5
 (Great app!) Love this service & the app.

Version 2.5.5 2013-14-06 4
 (Nice) Just downloaded it, already like it.

Version 2.5.5 2013-14-06 5
 (Air Bnb - works well for us) We like this page a lot. Easy to use and the phone app is genious

Version 2.5.3 2013-13-06 5
 ("La solución") Airbnb se transformo en la solución para mí y muchos amigos que viajanos a través del Mundo por diferentes motivos. Y podemos alquilar de manera seguro nuestras propiedades y conseguir lugares muy especiales en diferentes ciudades a precios razonables. Y gracias a la App puedo estar conectada permanentemente con potenciales pasajeros. Realmente lo Mejor . App de Airbnb

Version 2.5.5 2013-13-06 5
 (Great app!) I'm a host and this app makes it very easy to book and message people.

Version 2.5.5 2013-13-06 5
 (Love) Great app

Version 2.5.5 2013-11-06 5
 (Great app!) Works great! Able to search easily and access other properties!

Version 2.5.5 2013-10-06 5
 (Just wow) This is a very impressive app, I've found many beautiful places to stay at many locations. I highly recommend this app to those adventure seeking, local-wannabe travelers! I love it!

Version 2.5.5 2013-10-06 4
 (Host user needs more options.) I am a host and I love being able to keep in contact when on the road or when in bed from my iPhone. However, this app lacks some of the features available when logged in through the website. If it were more robust, I'd give a 5 star

Version 2.5.5 2013-09-06 5
 (Love airbnb) Used for 1st time on 1st trip to Europe and highly recommend and Recommend Gayle's apartment in Milan

Version 2.5.5 2013-09-06 1
 (Bad functionality and customer support will leave you hanging) This app cannot be used to do all you will need to get done through airbnb to be able to reliably rent a place to stay at.  They require you to upload a video of yourself, at a random time, to the website to verify your online profile, but yet you can not do this video through the app on your phone.  I am currently backpacking though Switzerland using airbnb when all the sudden they wanted me to upload a video of myself to verify my next destination or else they will automatically cancel my next reservation.  I cannot do that with this app, now I need to find an internet cafe with a webcam, very frustrating.

Version 2.5.5 2013-09-06 5
 (5*) Best app for rent apartments

Version 2.5.5 2013-09-06 5
 (Terrific app!) An excellent product; works seamlessly, doesn't crash or freeze. It offers all the functions necessary to run your bed-n-breakfast right from your phone. If you have an iphone and an AirBnb property this little app is simply a must.

Version 2.5.5 2013-08-06 1
 (Absolutely worst experience ever.) No customer support, can't book stay. App is glitchy, messages have heavy delay, neither host nor I can get transaction to go through. Airbnb should invest in some infrastructure and customer support.

Version 2.5.5 2013-08-06 5
 (take a chance...) I have 2 homes on airbnb and started with a home at a discounted rate for people seeking medical treatments from out of town. a place to call home during a difficult time. we've met incredible people and paying human kindness forward...

we enjoy having people stay in our place and enjoy all the comforts of home. airbnb also gives us the opportunity to stay in great places at reasonable rates. 

thanks for being born airbnb!

Version 2.5.5 2013-08-06 5
 (Tenant) Good so far

Version 2.5.5 2013-07-06 5
 (Phone app rocks!) Finding some great options for my trip to Spain!

Version 2.5.5 2013-06-06 5
 (Awesome) Streamlines the process for both host & guest! Keep it up!

Version 2.5.5 2013-03-06 5
 (An app with a real purpose!) This app isn't just another travel app or something you download for a day then delete. Using AirBnB opens up the world to exploration and while creating friendships that otherwise never would have existed. Brilliant idea, I look forward to more future trips!

Tip: If you use hostels you gotta start using this! More locations and safer

Version 2.5.5 2013-03-06 2
 (violates my privacy by showing "groups" on my profile which I have no control over changing) Wish I didn't have to leave a negative review but their support team was totally unhelpful. This is a complaint about the iphone app specifically, not the website. I do not want the groups on my profile to appear, they do not appear on the Airbnb site, but I have no control over editing the list or removing them on my profile inside the app.

Their support team was entirely unhelpful and refused to resolve the issue - total oversight that I can't control every aspect of the profile the app presents.

Version 2.5.5 2013-03-06 5
 (Great interface. Great service) Simple. Quick. Intuitive (apart from finding your favourites).

Version 2.5.5 2013-03-06 5
 (Great app) I always use this app to book my bed n breakfast in the heart of big cities! I love airbnb

Version 2.5.5 2013-02-06 5
 (Fantastic Community) As travelers who appreciate the more personal experience of B&Bs but on a budget, airbnb allows us to meet new and interesting people along the way and stay more in our budget. We love it!!

Version 2.5.5 2013-02-06 5
 (Fabulous app!) This app is terrific and I use it every week for hosting and for traveling, too. I hope to never got to a boring old hotel ever again, thanks, Airbnb!

Version 2.5.5 2013-02-06 5
 (Awesome!) This is the best site and app ever!

Version 2.5.5 2013-01-06 5
 (Smooth & Capable!) This app is a smooth as silk to use and is capable of doing almost everything I can do on the full airbnb website. As a host, it makes accepting reservations and managing my booking calendar a breeze. As a guest, it makes it easy to find the perfect pad on-the-go.

Version 2.5.5 2013-01-06 5
 (Best Company and App) I love Airbnb's app. The interface is clean and easy to use. I communicate with all my guests through the app and it is very simple. I have been using Airbnb for over a year now as a host and a guest and I love the company as well as the app.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (App is no longer working.) App is not working for some reason...

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 5
 (Almost better than the actual site) No problems, just solutions.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (The app crashes everytime I try opening it) The App crashes everytime I try opening it on my phone. It hasn't been jailbroken or anything so it has been working fine, but suddenly it doesn't work.

App support - please look into it.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (Crashes) App never loads. Crashes every time it's opened.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (Crashing) Crashing every time after opening it. Please fix! Otherwise good app.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (Fail) I wanted to like it but I could only get it to open once.  Crash and burn every other time. No developer info so who do I contact?  IPhone 5 & latest iOs version.
Sorry, but this needs some work to get to stable release.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (FAIL for iOS 6.1.4) The app won't open on the iPhone 5. It crashes immediately every time. I wrote to the Airbnb and they recommended I use the desktop version.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (Crashes) Downloaded this app today to prepare for a summer trip. All it does is crash. Epic fail! Delete!

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (Crashes!) Won't even open.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (Doesn't work) The app won't open in my iPhone 4S. I have the latest version of the OS.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (Won't Open) Won't open on my up-to-date iPhone 5... Just flashes the screen for one second, then returns me to my home screen.

Version 2.5.5 2013-31-05 1
 (Doesn't work) App closes every time I open it on my iPhone 5

Version 2.5.5 2013-30-05 1
 (Worked... And now it doesn't) This app is beautifully designed and worked beautifully.  I logged out of my account on the app and every since I haven't been able to launch the app without it crashing.

Version 2.5.5 2013-30-05 1
 (Crashes every time) The app crashes upon loading on BOTH my iPhone 4 and my iPhone 5.
Please fix.

Version 2.5.5 2013-30-05 5
 (Fantastic) Great app and amazing product.

Version 2.5.5 2013-30-05 5
 (Fantastic) Great app! Easy to use, secured, no fuss, and most importantly, the hosts and the properties have been checked out by AIRBNB. This is the best way to get great accommodation at a great price. And staying with the hosts helps you make friends!

Version 2.5.5 2013-30-05 5
 (Abnbfan) App is easy to use !! Easy access to a home away from home!! Will use again;)

Version 2.5.5 2013-29-05 3
 (Missing some important features) This app is missing practical features essential for hosts. For example, there is no way to manage your inbox (delete messages) or check your account ($) details- i.e. past and future payments. I also suggest giving the option to NOT leave a review for someone without having that distracting notification number just sitting there forever. This last suggestion may seem trivial to some, but as a busy host I find the notification alert a useful reminder. However, having it there permanently nullifies this otherwise convenient function. Thank you.

Version 2.5.5 2013-29-05 5
 (Love it) Use it all the time. Not as many features as the main site but great. On the iPad you have to enlarge the app to make it bigger.

Version 2.5.5 2013-29-05 5
 (Great houses around the world) Entertaining, fun and useful to find places to stay world wide. 
Apartments, houses, villas, lofts, everything you could imagine.

Version 2.5.5 2013-28-05 4
 (Orlando trip) We went to Orlando for memorial weekend found a great deal with Airbnd. The apartment was clean, great deal, t was what it shows on the picture . The transaction went very easy
I love it

Version 2.2.1 2013-27-05 5
 (Love!) Airbnb is a fantastic company and service and their app is a total pleasure to use!

Version 2.5.5 2013-27-05 5
 (Excellent!) Used Airbnb for the first time on a recent international trip. The property management company we booked with were excellent and helpful, and the entire process was smooth. Highly recommend for a visit outside of tradition/all-inclusive hotels

Version 2.5.5 2013-27-05 5
 (Live it.. Love it!) Before 2011 I will stay at hotels who would just eat my money and left me with no experience but only the experience of paying extra for everything you asked, consumed, touch, etc. In my opinion a traveler is nothing without wifi.. We need it to communicate with our friends/family, for general info about the surroundings where we are staying etc. Since I discovered airbnb my EXPERIENCE when traveling has never been the same. Trust me it would change the way you travel! Expect for you "fancy" people who don't like to experience $h*t (w/ all due respect)

Version 2.5.5 2013-26-05 5
 (Great App!!!) I love this App!!!

Version 2.2.2 2013-26-05 5
 (Great app) This app makes it easy to be in communication with our renters.  Great tool!

Version 2.5.3 2013-25-05 5
 (Love this) Greatttttt

Version 2.5.5 2013-25-05 5
 (Simply the best!) Thank you so much to the creators of such a great App! Now I can travel easier and also can earn some money renting my space!

Version 2.5.5 2013-25-05 5
 (Love this app) Made my trip to Paris on airbnb, was really great!

Version 2.5.1 2013-25-05 5
 (Great idea) Wish I'd thought of this concept. We booked a great place in Chicago. Owner was fantastic to work with and the condo was perfectly located, close to family. Love the pics on the app. Gets me excited about our upcoming travels because I know we'll have tons of options to consider.

Version 2.5.5 2013-24-05 5
 (Excellent option for Traveling) This app is fantastic. I've stayed at 4 residences now sight unseen and thanks to honest review from other users I've had *excellent experiences on my travel adventures. The app runs so smoothly and allows you to do business right from your phone or iPad. Very well recommended for anyone seeking a reliable company to help you find a place to stay while abroad!

Version 2.5.5 2013-23-05 5
 (Favorite travel site) Best website ever invented! Way better than hotels. I haven't looked at one since I started with Airbnb!

Version 2.5.5 2013-22-05 5
 (Love it.) This is awesome.

Version 2.5.5 2013-22-05 5
 (Excellent way to travel-GOOD App) Easy to navigate, clear app. Good photos and options for searching a place to stay. Lots of availability to stay in most cities. Looking forward to trying to host & make some $$!

Version 2.5.5 2013-22-05 4
 (Great app) Easy to navigate.

Version 2.5.5 2013-21-05 5
 (Absolutely wonderful!) This app is a lifesaver and gives me the opportunity to respond immediately to my guest requests!

Version 2.5.5 2013-21-05 1
 (App fails to open) App always crashes on iPhone 4S with iOS 6.1.3 up date.

Version 2.5.3 2013-21-05 5
 (Awesome) The airbnb app has made traveling all over the world so much easier!

Version 2.5.5 2013-20-05 1
 (App crashes) I love airbnb, but whenever I try to open the app it crashes every single time. I've deleted and reinstalled it a few times. Same thing. Airbnb please fix !!

Version 2.5.5 2013-20-05 5
 (Thank you AirBnB) We love to host people. A great way to meet travelers and earn some money!

Version 2.5.5 2013-20-05 5
 (Great way to rent housing all over the world) It work great, the application works great on my phone. I'm very happy.
It's fast and private.

Version 2.5.5 2013-20-05 5
 (Phenomenal) Last minute trip????   PERFECT SITE!!!

Version 2.5.5 2013-20-05 5
 (Excellent) This service makes hosting a breeze. It basically runs your business for you. I get a text whenever an inquiry or booking comes my way. I can log into the phone app and accept, decline or email for additional info. I can route payouts to more than one account. And they have great customer support!  Really all you need to do is take a few great pictures of your place, come up with your pricing, update your listing and voila. Just sit back and enjoy your bookings.

Version 2.5.5 2013-20-05 5
 (Love Airbnb and this app is great!) Best thing to happen to travel since airplanes.

Version 2.5.5 2013-20-05 5
 (Love airbnb) Best way to stay in great places!!! Love this app

Version 2.5.5 2013-19-05 4
 (Great service, decent app) Airbnb is an awesome service. The mobile app is good too, though I wish it was a bit more full-featured. For instance, I wanted to view/edit my reviews (since I'm traveling and don't have my laptop of course!) but seemed like I couldn't do that. Also the app failed to save my review after I submitted it so I had to write it all over again.

Overall I've had so much fun traveling through airbnb, looking forward to my next trip!

Version 2.5.5 2013-19-05 5
 (The best) Airbnb isn't just an app it's a community. There's no better way to get the most value for your money when traveling.

Version 2.5.5 2013-19-05 5
 (Helpful!) I usedit at the wifi spots in Italy to book all of my stays. Worked great! 

I even used Otto write quick reviews while on the go.

Version 2.5.5 2013-19-05 5
 (Amazingly useful app) Really user friendly interface.

Version 2.5.5 2013-18-05 4
 (Great App for great service) Easy to use for the already amazing airbnb service. Everything you need is right in your hand.

Version 2.5.5 2013-18-05 5
 (Manage hosting on the go) So nice to be able to sit around and book new guests through the app. Doesn't have all the site features but it has matured nicely for most of what hosts need.

Version 2.5.5 2013-18-05 5
 (Cherry orchard timber- frame cabin) Love this app! Love Airbnb! Love being a host!

Version 2.2.2 2013-17-05 5
 (Airbnb is a MUST!!!!) Airbnb offers a great alternate for people to have unique travel options and not stuck with the same hotel chains...

Version 2.5.5 2013-17-05 5
 (Amazing) Superb app!

Version 2.5.5 2013-16-05 5
 (Very good) Good app for finding place to stay

Version 2.5.5 2013-16-05 5
 (Stop WASTING your money! Download Airbnb and get your money's worth once and for all!!!) Airbnb provides every type of traveler, business and leisure, with the perfect app to find a GREAT place to stay. From hotels & small apartment to mansions & castles, Airbnb has it all. Whatever your budget, whatever your preference Airbnb has you covered. The best part is that they VERIFY you to make sure no creepers stay in any of their places. Also, reviews can only be made by people who have actually stayed in one of their places so there are no false reviews...EVER.

Version 2.5.5 2013-16-05 5
 (Fantastic) An excellent app. Makes traveling so much more easy and pleasant. I've made new friends and stayed in many interesting places since finding this app.

Version 2.5.5 2013-16-05 4
 (Nice app) But need to improve host friendliness. Managing listing, settings, calendar pricing, and all that good stuff. 

Sometimes the desktop version on safari doesn't work.

Version 2.5.5 2013-16-05 5
 (Airbnb app) Quick and easy way to manage my listing!

Version 2.5.5 2013-16-05 5
 (Useful, Easy App) Great way to browse listings & keep up w/ communications. I use this app frequently to stay in touch w guests & potential guests :)

Version 2.5.5 2013-15-05 5
 (Love it!) The best app to ever happen to a new traveler. Yay!

Version 2.5.5 2013-15-05 4
 (love it!!) never spend a vacation in a boring hotel ever again!!

really fabulous selection of properties. only gripe is some of the facebook sharing seems to be broken...

Version 2.5.5 2013-15-05 5
 (Traveled near and far) I started using Airbnb in 2010 when it was widely unknown. Skeptical and very, very nervous whether is was legit or not, I booked my stays all through Europe because it seemed more personal and cost far less than hotels or hostels. When my group and I arrived in England at midnight I was sweating, holding onto hope it wasn't to good to be true. Now 3 years later I am more confident than ever with success in every rental I've booked (I hope I don't jinx myself). I recommend it to everyone who asks me how I save money traveling. I am sure people have horror stories but I love Airbnb!

Version 2.5.5 2013-15-05 5
 (Awesome.) Beautiful and very user friendly, in depth information at my fingertips. The app itself is perfect for someone on the go.

Version 2.5.5 2013-14-05 1
 (Left me stranded in Germany) A terrible terrible service. Greedy company wouldn't cancel my reservation until midnight the day I arrived even with no contact from the host for a month, leaving me to book a hotel at premium prices the day of. The service staff doesn't know anything except what they can Google (for example, where the booking was physically located) and were rude to boot.  After they couldn't reach the host they posted a fake review in my name on their site indicating that *I* had cancelled the reservation the day before I arrived. Spent hours waiting at the premise and ran up $50 in roaming fees talking to their service staff for nothing. No thank you, never again. The company gives you a false sense of security by taking you money directly, but really all they do is take control out of your hands to resolve issues yourself and their only interest is collecting their fee.

Version 2.5.5 2013-14-05 3
 (Almost great!) For hosts its kind of a pain that you can't see the total for an inquiry. And when you go to your calendar you can't see what your rates are, so I've had to call Airbnb every time I want to respond to a guest with a special offer, since I can't see the calculated total anywhere!

Otherwise.... It's a simple app and pretty intuitive. I Just want all the same info as the website, please.

Version 2.5.5 2013-13-05 5
 (Love it!) Great app and service!

Version 2.5.5 2013-13-05 5
 (Greaattttt) Perfect idea & excellent application

Version 2.5.5 2013-13-05 4
 (Near perfect) As a host, I love having everything on my iPhone. But full editing capability just isn't there. For instance, I can't find the method or button to sync calendars between iPhone and app.  Otherwise, good job. Probably better for traveller than host.

Version 2.5.0 2013-13-05 4
 (Calendar Updating) I enjoy the app but there really should be a way to view the Itinerary from the calendar view.

Version 2.2.3 2013-12-05 4
 (Awesomeness) Found great places to stay...a few bugs but works amazingly well overall...

Version 2.5.5 2013-12-05 5
 (Luv airbnb app) Luv it

Version 2.5.5 2013-11-05 5
 (Brendan) Airbnb is a great website

Version 2.5.5 2013-10-05 3
 (Like the app but WHERE IS THE IPAD VERSION?) You really need an iPad or Universal version of your app!

Any plans?

Version 2.5.5 2013-10-05 5
 (Best App for Travel) I love how easy this is to use and how reviews, photographs and payment is being taken care of. I had great locations all the way through and can recommend this App to everyone who loves to travel!

Version 2.5.5 2013-09-05 5
 (Awesomeness) I love the app

Version 2.5.5 2013-08-05 4
 (AirBnB in the palm of your hand!) This is a great way to have AirBnB at your fingertips. I do which it had more if the web based features like my reservations for bookings but I'm sure that will be soon.

Version 2.5.5 2013-08-05 1
 (Airdnw) Air does not work.  Worst app ever.  Get used to seeing "an unknown error has occurred". Unreliable is a terrible feature for an app used to book travel arrangements.

Version 2.5.4 2013-08-05 5
 (Excellent experience) Through Airbnb we've stayed with loads of great people all over the place. We'll be using this to plan our next big trip!

Version 2.5.5 2013-07-05 5
 (Awesome!) This is the best recommendation ever!!
It was an awesome experience!!

Version 2.5.5 2013-07-05 5
 (Couple traveling together) We love Airbnb and recommend it to all our friends.  It is a friendly adventure each time we have stayed through Airbnb!

Version 2.5.5 2013-07-05 5
 (Absolutely love this app!) Fantastic!! Use it not only to book a place while traveling but also a great way to get new ideas on design.

Version 2.5.5 2013-07-05 5
 (Auh-maze-ING) Pretty much the ONLY way to travel!!!

Version 2.5.5 2013-07-05 5
 (Awesome) Great idea. Already used it and was very happy!

Version 2.5.4 2013-06-05 5
 (Airbnb at your finger tips) Very well designed app - easy to browse through all the interesting housing offers worldwide. Nice touches for getting in touch with your host via
Email or a convenient button to call then. Keep track of open reservations and favorites. Snappy and intuitive in delivering up pics and videos of the properties. Wish all apps were so easy to use!

Version 2.5.4 2013-06-05 4
 (Great tool) Overall a great tool and pretty easy to use. Based on personal nature of this service, would like ability to filter based on gender of roommates. (My wife and I might be uncomfortable if I were to stay with a single woman.)  

Would also like to be able to remove properties and delete messages from my inbox.  That way, if I choose to reject a place, it doesn't keep showing up again. Just the opposite of the favorites list. 

Overall a really useful app.

Version 2.5.3 2013-05-05 5
 (It does what it's supposed to!) Brilliant app keeps you connected while away from you desk!

Version 2.5.5 2013-05-05 5
 (Love Airbnb) Pretty much the only a I travel now!

Version 2.5.4 2013-05-05 5
 (Great app and service!) I love airbnb, and the app is fantastic! It allows hosts to instantly reply to potential guests which is a big plus in getting reservations. Great concept!

Version 2.5.3 2013-05-05 2
 (Great company- terrible app) Amazing idea, great dot com, great visual design, worst ux for an app I have seen In a while. Unreliable, inconvenient and un-befitting of such an awesome company.

Version 2.5.4 2013-05-05 5
 (Wowzers!!) Updated after trip.   Love love love this app!  Made my first travel arrangements and looking forward to it!!  Well, I traveled and just got back and was thrilled with my experience!  I can't wait to book another place with airbnb!  Awesome service and app is great way to stay I touch with travel plans when no computer available;)

Version 2.5.5 2013-04-05 5
 (Great app) With great features and easy search filters

Version 2.5.5 2013-03-05 5
 (Awesome.. Makes traveling easier) Awesome app saved me tons of money and still had a great place to stay ... Its like home away from home. 

Just freaking awesome ... I was stupid not to try this before .. From now on this is how i book a place to stay ... 

Thank you for whoever made this app

Version 2.5.5 2013-03-05 3
 (not convenient. just for messaging.) the idea is cool, but it is not convenient at all. one could browse the apartment, and write messages only. it's a headache to manage one's listing, to make changes.

Version 2.5.5 2013-03-05 5
 (Where have you been all my life?!) My new favorite thing.  That is all.

Version 2.5.5 2013-03-05 4
 (Love this service) I haven't used the app very much on my phone, but I was able to message easily  the people I need to contact.
So far I love airbnb.

Version 2.5.4 2013-02-05 1
 (App crashes) App used to be ideal.....however now App crashes each time I attempt to accept a reservation request.  Please fix this bug ASAP.

Version 2.5.4 2013-01-05 5
 (A review) Such a great experience. :)

Version 2.5.4 2013-29-04 4
 (Easy to use) Awesome inventional app, with every resources in the palm of your hand, literally. Good.

Version 2.5.3 2013-29-04 5
 (HANDY!) Great for hosts--so helpful.

Version 2.5.4 2013-29-04 3
 (Crashing) The app is fabulous, but the bugs make it counterproductive. When attempting to accept a reservation, the app closes, so I have to log into the mobile site anyway. Please repair it.

Version 2.5.4 2013-29-04 5
 (Best user interface ... Ever!) Love this App it really makes it easy to manage my reservations!

Version 2.5.4 2013-28-04 1
 (Broken, confusing format) With this version I can't accept reservations without the app crashing. I don't know when I'll have computer access next, so my request will likely expire due to this bug. This app could really use a dashboard because the notifications are also broken and will still show up as new even though I looked at them multiple times. Fix this!

Version 2.5.4 2013-27-04 5
 (Love AirBnb, Love the App) This app gives all the convenience and accessibility of the website in the palm of your hand. The alerts are so nice when communicating with hosts!

Version 2.5.4 2013-26-04 4
 (Amazing App !) Have me so many options,, even greater than I first thought.

Version 2.5.4 2013-26-04 5
 (Love it) This website is just what the 20th century needs! The app could be a bit simpler but it's still great

Version 2.5.3 2013-26-04 4
 (Four Star!) Great App! Even when I don't really plan a trip, I like to look through houses/apartments for designing purposes. Should definitely  include the mileage radius and specific requests. For example if I'm looking for a place with indoor pool I want to be able to filter all of the other places out. Other ways very handy app!

Version 2.5.3 2013-26-04 5
 (NYC SÃO PAULO) Great app. It has given me not just great guests but made great friends from it. All over the world. Strongly recommended .

Version 2.5.1 2013-25-04 5
 (Amazing !!) Its amazing and friendly

Version 2.5.4 2013-25-04 5
 (Great app) Easy accessible.

Version 2.5.4 2013-24-04 2
 (Won't accept reservations) New version crashes when attempting to accept a reservation request

Version 2.5.3 2013-24-04 5
 (Mr Aloha) The next big thing!! Hotels are out.. Vacation rentals are in.. Value x3 .. AirBnB is a revolution.

Version 2.5.4 2013-23-04 3
 (Was a nifty program) This program was pretty neat. 

But with this version, it won't launch at all. 

iPhone 5. 
Always at latest version of iOS. 

Ps: hard to know how to rate.

Version 2.5.3 2013-23-04 5
 (Change Agent for global good) Awesome app and awesome service!

Version 2.5.4 2013-23-04 2
 (New version is bugged) Can't accept reservations...

Version 2.5.4 2013-23-04 2
 (Booking issue) Great app but as a host you can't accept reservation since last update.

Version 2.5.3 2013-23-04 5
 (You'll be so happy you have this!) This is the best app I've ever used! I'm staying in beautiful homes in the best areas of Paris and Florence for a fraction of the cost!

Version 2.5.3 2013-22-04 5
 (Changed my life) Airbnb makes traveling much more fun and personal.  Highly recommend this app.  It works great!

Version 2.5.3 2013-22-04 5
 (Darling Companion) Airbnb goes with me to anyplace at anytime. It keep me on total contact and on call to be there if my guest need me. Efficiency and reliability must be mandatory, also a true love for hosting.

Version 2.5.4 2013-22-04 5
 (The AIR in BNB) Airbnb is very user friendly, affordable, easy to get to better than any hotel

Version 2.5.3 2013-21-04 5
 (Improves my response rate) Having the Airbnb app on my iPhone has really made it easy to respond to new reservation requests quickly. It alerts me with a distinct tone, and I instantly know someone is requesting a stay. I can read the inquiry, accept, deny, or ask for more information, check my calendar, and even make a special offer if I choose to. This app saves me so much time, and it works perfectly. The guests appreciate the rapid response, and my reservations get accepted more often because of it.

Version 2.5.4 2013-20-04 4
 (Useful and easy to use) This app is easy to search and browse with. I wish there was an iPad version. Some enhancements I would like to see are support for rotating the phone into horizontal mode, and the ability to zoom in on pictures and text.

Version 2.5.3 2013-20-04 5
 (One of the best apps out there) So easy and actually fun to use! It has features that make your travels so easy. Couldn't ask for better

Version 2.5.4 2013-20-04 5
 (Very easy to use!) Even easier than the web version, very user friendly!

Version 2.5.4 2013-20-04 5
 (Bueno) Excelente. Aplicacion

Version 2.5.3 2013-19-04 5
 (Super and they even have live tech support) Great way to find great places to stay for the price of many hotels. And they actually have live customer service! Great design.

Version 2.5.3 2013-19-04 5
 (Not the website but still very good.) I cannot say enough good things about airbnb, I love the site and the people who put their homes out for travelers. This website makes me feel a connection to the host in a way that hotels never do. I will always check airbnb before looking into hotels. I just wish more people would join.

Version 2.5.3 2013-18-04 5
 (✈💺🚊🚕🚖) A great app, it revolutionizes the way of traveling, finding a great room for the price. When I travel I like to explore and sometimes to travel you have to succumb to hotels but why pay more when you can pay less and still have a great experience?!?

Version 2.5.3 2013-18-04 5
 (Love it) Better than hotels at around the same prices. I love this app if it isn't for big fixes dnt change it!!!

Version 2.5.3 2013-18-04 5
 (Genius) We just absolutely love AirBnB. It has revolutionized the way we travel. A suggestion for the app itself would be to make it possible to change the user profile in the app....rather than having to log into the desk top. But honestly all in all this is a 5 star service. We LOVE it.

Version 2.5.3 2013-17-04 5
 (Just an amazing travel experience! :)) I do love airbnb and its style of travel! 

I always feel really confortable in the places that I stayed and meet people that become real friends. 

Oh! And I went to the airbnb's HQ in San Francisco and that just cause an upgrade in my admiration for the easy, funny, nice and local way of travel all around.

Hotels are boring! Let's try something less tourist and more real.

:)

Version 2.5.3 2013-16-04 5
 (Amazing) For me it is an amazing app, easy and simple to find what u want

Version 2.5.3 2013-16-04 5
 (Melinda McLain) Our first airbnb experience could not have been more delightful! This warm, comfy, lovely home was perfect for our needs. The fantastic view and sunny porch were a delight. We loved parking our car upon arrival, then walking to great neighborhoods all weekend. The personally written, comprehensive guide provided guests is of great benefit to tourists. People who love opera/classical music, gardening/sustainability, parakeets, and     interior design would really find Nirvana in this home, with these wonderful hosts.  We'll be back!!

Version 2.5.3 2013-15-04 5
 (Great for hosts or guests) I'm an airbnb host and this app makes managing incoming reservations much easier. Being notified of a new request means I can react faster and book more guests. Easy to use. Love it.

Version 2.5.3 2013-14-04 5
 (Works great for hosting) And for travel

Version 2.5.3 2013-14-04 5
 (Great alternative to hotels!) I've met lots of cool locals & have had great experiences all around!

Version 2.5.3 2013-14-04 5
 (Light years better than hotels) Love the concept, love the app, love the results. Real people and a local's-eye-view of wherever you visit. Just love for the folks at Airbnb.

Version 2.5.3 2013-14-04 5
 (Muito bacana!) Pessoas legais, atraem pessoas legais.

Version 2.5.3 2013-14-04 5
 (Great app... Works perfect.) Lets me manage my property through my phone

Version 2.5.3 2013-13-04 5
 (It's amazing!) Good ideas!very useful !the best way to travel u want!

Version 2.5.3 2013-13-04 4
 (Pets allowed filter would be nice) Pets allowed filter would be nice, otherwise great app!

Version 2.5.3 2013-12-04 5
 (Love this service!) This is the coolest site in the internet, especially for travelers, not only those on a budget but who want more from their stay. I have just experienced staying with two different hosts, in two states, and cherish the local cultural perspective one can't get from staying in a hotel.

Version 2.5.3 2013-12-04 5
 (Easy to list property!) The process of listing my property was very easy, and the end result looks great on the app as well as on their website!  I'm excited to see where this app takes me!

Version 2.5.3 2013-12-04 5
 (Five stars) Absolutely amazing. So easy to use and saves me tons of time!!

Version 2.5.3 2013-12-04 3
 (Promising… but now just a watered down version of the website) (Disclosure, I use this app to manage guests who want to book my property. I haven't used it to book myself into other's homes). 

This app has promise. The best feature is push notifications for when a person contacts you about a reservation. You can easily accept or make them an offer. It shows you your upcoming reservations. You can also "block" out dates for unavailability for your property. 

But, this is a watered down version of the website. You cannot set (or change) pricing. You can upload, but not reorganize photos. You cannot edit your personal profile or the profile for your property. The navigation is a little confusing.

And my biggest gripe… Only one device can be logged into the app at any given time. I manage my property with a co-owner. When I log in, he is kicked out and vice versa. Once signed/kicked out, push notifications no longer arrive (which defeats the purpose of push). 

I would say this app is essential if you are an airbnb property owner, but more work is needed to really make this app function independently from the website.

Version 2.5.3 2013-11-04 2
 (Basic function Improvement for Hosts) The app has little utility for Hosts.  Most importantly a refresh button for messages.  I get SMS alerts stating part of a message but no way to make the app give me the message on congested NYC mobile bandwidth.  Very frustrating for me and I'm sure anxiety inducing for guests who were accustomed to my immediate responses on wifi/laptop.

(And an upward swipe doesn't always respond)

Would like to be able to see the potential price of what a rental is before booking (from the host perspective).

Version 2.5.3 2013-11-04 4
 (Awesomeness.) Great service!

Version 2.5.3 2013-10-04 5
 (Joachim) I stayed in Joachim 's flat and it was great. It was one block from a grocery store and 5 blocks from the Main Street where you could catch local transport. It is definitely in a safe neighborhood. 
He had great Internet service and tons of tv stations which was nice to relax in front of the tv after a long day of sightseeing. It was perfect for our stay and I highly recommend staying in his flat. Joachim was great at communicating with me and he made arrangements to get us our key. We loved Copenhagen and the people are fantastic. The Queen would be proud.

Version 2.5.3 2013-10-04 4
 (Fantastic app) It's a great app but I can't see price about a request when hosting.

Version 2.5.3 2013-10-04 5
 (My "go to" when traveling!) Just finished my third stay with an Airbnb host and LOVED it! You have such variety to choose from wherever you go! The prices are usually the same or better than a hotel and often for an entire place! I love this app!! So easy to use!

Version 2.5.3 2013-08-04 5
 (Great awesome App) New member and so far I love it!! A few of my friends found out about this app all at the same time and none of us can stop looking at all the great potential world destinations to visit. Have recommended it to many people.

Version 2.5.3 2013-08-04 5
 (Excellent app for see the world economically) Live this app. You could literally see the world on a frugal budget and not give up safety, cleanliness and location.

Version 2.5.3 2013-08-04 5
 (User friendly) This app and site is amazing! So easy to use and so much better than booking at hotels, where you get less for more money! I recommend to anyone who loves to travel!

Version 2.5.3 2013-08-04 5
 (Great app!!) I never have to use the website...and being someone who travels..that is a huge plus!

Version 2.5.1 2013-07-04 5
 (Love it) Not sure what the previous reviewers are talking about. I've had no trouble with this app and booked my reservation seamlessly. I was able to look at all info and contact information. It's super convenient. I don't have to login every time either... Anyways, love the app- but most important adore Airbnb!

Version 2.5.3 2013-07-04 4
 (Needs a couple tweaks) Overall a good app. My only complaint is the inability to update a reservation via the app; one must go to the full site for that, which is a hassle.

Version 2.5.3 2013-07-04 1
 (DO NOT USE THIS APP) If I can give negative stars I would. I have had many problems with this app including not getting emails and my accepting reservations not going through.  I called AirBnB customer service and they said "Don't use the app it's not made by us. Use our website instead. This app is known for issues."  Could have fooled me that the app wasn't made by AirBnB so don't download the app says AirBnB customer service because it's buggy as heck.

Version 2.5.3 2013-07-04 3
 (Needs work) Some people think this is the place to review airbnb as such, but this is not the case. These reviews are meant for the app only. That being said, despite the large number of updates, the app still misses the mark on a couple fronts. The first and most egregious is the fact that unlike most (non-bank related) apps, you have to log-in every single time you want to use it. This seems like a small matter, but can get annoying when you have multiple guests/inquiries and use the app a lot. Second - when you try to send messages to guests, often the message disappears when you hit send and does not actually send. If you don't think to save the message first as a safety, you'll have to recompose it. 
As a side note, airbnb itself is awesome! We are hosting more than ever and loving it.

Version 2.5.3 2013-06-04 5
 (Awesome app and website!!!!) I love airbnb! I don't think I will ever stay in a hotel! Or actually before I go anywhere I will definitely check places to stay before any hotel!

Version 2.5.3 2013-05-04 5
 (Convenient!) This app helps keep me informed about new inquiries and respond on the go, as they happen. I believe I've been able to secure many of my new bookings because of this app. It's easy to use and looks good too.

Version 2.5.3 2013-05-04 5
 (Amazing) Love it! So easy and convenient. I'll never stay at a hotel again! AirBNB is where it's at!!

Version 2.5.3 2013-04-04 5
 (Airbnb saved me) Wow in 2 months I had people from 8 counties visit and stay with me airbnb I love u I live on a remote island in the Caribbean Vieques puerto Rico come visit me too

Version 2.5.3 2013-04-04 5
 (Good) I hope there is also an app for iPad.

Version 2.5.3 2013-03-04 5
 (Greaaaaat App!!!) Besides the fact that everything works, is the background idea that rules Airbnb, the experience of getting to know people and places is remarkable!!! Nice to see and remember that great things happens trough tech!!!

Version 2.5.3 2013-03-04 5
 (A.M.A.Z.I.N.G... Awesomely easy and users are real!) Last minute trip to London and Rome and literally within 15 minutes of looking and messaging, two great places. I pray fraudsters/commercial companies don't figure out how to exploit this great community.

Version 2.5.3 2013-03-04 5
 (What is life, w/o Airbnb?) First things first, Airbnb has to be one of the few trusted sites i have used. 
Customer service is great and there is a 24/7 service and online assistance to avoid headaches. 

I am a college student abroad in Europe and Airbnb has helped me travel to places at ease, w/o having to worry about booking a hostel and such. 

This application is very handy. I rarely go on my Macbook and book places anymore, its super easy to use and recommend everyone! 

Happy booking!

Version 2.5.3 2013-03-04 5
 (Great!) This app lets me find houses/condos that are surprisingly cheap to rent if going on vacation and you want more privacy than staying at a huge hotel with lots of ppl. Its awesome having the pool to yourself with your fam :)

Version 2.5.3 2013-02-04 5
 (Fabulous) Great!!!

Version 2.5.3 2013-02-04 5
 (Great Alternative to Expensive Hotels) Great App design. Have been using Airbnb for short and long term stays. Great alternative to expensive hotels. Have met many nice people during our travels. Highly recommended.

Version 2.5.3 2013-02-04 5
 (Fabulous!) 5 stars for ease of use, intuitive design, and highly recommendable.

 (Nicely done!) Great place to find a great place

Version 2.5.3 2013-30-03 5
 (Intuitive) Beautifully designed app. Works well and every user need was considered without going over the top.

Version 2.5.3 2013-30-03 5
 (A Must Have for Trip Planning) After great experiences staying in AirBnb flats during a trip last year to England and Scotland, I am absolutely sold on this app! Whether you're planning your next big trip, a weekend getaway or just adding an adventure to your wish list, airbnb has everything from the practical to luxurious to choose from. And the app is so easy to navigate, the only thing you'll have to worry about is what to pack!

Version 2.5.3 2013-29-03 5
 (Tremenda!!!!!) Waooooo! Indispensable para mi alquileres. Puedo hacer todo desde mi teléfono sin tener que acceder a mi computadora de escritorio. La aplicación me da la libertad de contestar las inquietudes de las huéspedes, hacer reservaciones y recibir los pagos desde cualquier parte, mientras disfruto de otras actividades. Además mantengo una agenda de con la fechas de las estadías lo que me permite minimizar cualquier omisión con las fechas de disponibilidad de los huéspedes. Lo recomiendo %100.

Version 2.5.3 2013-29-03 1
 (Facebook login does not work) I get a string of errors every time I try to log in. I have to use the web to access my account because the app us now useless

Version 2.5.3 2013-29-03 4
 (Great app, would be 5 stars if dog friendly filter) Need to be add the capability to filter by dog friendly options. Would definitely be 5 star app once that feature is added!

Version 2.5.1 2013-28-03 5
 (Hotel beater) This is the downfall of hotels. I love it.

Version 2.5.3 2013-28-03 5
 (looooove) completely addicting...I could spend hours on here carefully constructing a lifetime's of dream vacation stays.

Version 2.5.3 2013-28-03 5
 (Great App! Easy to use!) The service provided by airbnb is amazing, now pair that up with a super sleek, easy to use app and it's a win win for everyone! I sometimes prefer using the app over the site bc it's so easy!!!

Version 2.5.1 2013-28-03 1
 (Worst thing ever) Giant scam the whole airbnb system is a scam and its associated with first call resolutions as a client don't work for then they are a scam

Version 2.5.3 2013-28-03 5
 (Impressive app) This is by far my new favorite app. Extremely intuitive and easy to use, seamless. It even saves my previous requests and will automatically swap out the names of the hosts, really smart app!

Version 2.5.3 2013-27-03 5
 (Very Impressed!) So far my experience with airbnb has been outstanding. Wish I would have checked it out sooner!

Version 2.5.3 2013-27-03 5
 (Great!) Tremendous App!! Very useful and reliable.

Version 2.5.3 2013-27-03 5
 (So easy to use) I am loving this so far.  So easy to locate just the right vacation rentals.  Found two wonderful cottages where we'll be traveling this summer and not only are the prices incredibly reasonable, but the photos are invaluable to give you a real feel for the properties. Thanks to the friend at work who hipped me to Airbnb.

Version 2.5.3 2013-26-03 5
 (The whole service rules!) Not just the app! The whole service of AirBNB rocks! Save time, money and logistic.

Version 2.5.3 2013-25-03 5

 (Great tool!) I found this through a friend and I am very impressed about how easy and cheap it is to find properties to stay at!

Version 2.5.3 2013-25-03 5
 (Love this app!) I spent hours browsing amazing spaces with this app. I can't wait to travel more, and this certainly lends to my wanderlust.

Version 2.5.3 2013-24-03 5
 (wonderful) five stars

Version 2.5.3 2013-24-03 5
 (Gold Standard for Apps!) This app is smooth, intuitive and leads to the desired conclusion flawlessly. Air BnB should also be in the app business.

Version 2.5.3 2013-24-03 5
 (Great) Excelente app and even best website. The best way to travel.

Version 2.5.3 2013-24-03 5
 (Excellent) Flawless app with priceless service for traveller like me. Check it out!

Version 2.5.3 2013-24-03 5
 (Fabulous!) Took a trip to Paris for my first experience, it worked out perfectly! I plan on using this for all my trips this semester. It works really great when traveling in groups (I traveled with 6 college aged girls) you can find a place for very reasonable.

Version 2.5.1 2013-23-03 4
 (Must have!!!!) Great app! Have used it all over and it's a great way to get a more "local" feel when visiting a new place. I wish there was a way to view past reservations (I've often wanted to recommend places I've stayed to friends). Other than that, it's great!! :)

Version 2.5.3 2013-23-03 5
 (🍆) 🍅🌽🍑🍓

Version 2.5.3 2013-23-03 5
 (Must have) Great app. It have some things that you can't do like in the computer but is a msut have.

Version 2.5.3 2013-22-03 5
 (Future of online enterprise) This site (I've used only the iPhone app, which is flawless).. is fully customized, positioned for growth, and done very, very well..

When will you guys be going public? Haha

Version 2.5.0 2013-21-03 2
 (AirBB has been forever ruined) I have been using AirBB for traveling, short term rentals and even as discovery app. I was one of the first members and I always believe in it's potentials.

Unfortunately AirBB it is not anymore a tool to connect private users throughout the world, it became the Disneyland of real estate brokers. 
Now a good 60% of the users are actually professional brokers who will want your fee on top of airBB fee.

What was a wonderful way to reach new friends and new places, became a new Craigslist. 
Do a little search! Try Tokyo, New York.. you'll se that many apts are advertised by the same person.
This person is a broker who will ask you to pay his fee (on top of airBB fee and daily rental).

Version 2.5.3 2013-20-03 4
 (Convenient!) This app is easy to use on the go. I needed a room ASAP and used it and within 30 mins had paid and secured a room. There are some aspects of this app that are slow. The emails update a bit too slow.

Version 2.5.3 2013-20-03 5
 (Spread the word) A cost effective way to bring humanity back into the world.

Version 2.5.1 2013-19-03 5
 (This app is a game changer!) I only use this for places to stay when traveling

Version 2.5.3 2013-19-03 5
 (Extremely cool app) This app is very useful if u love traveling

Version 2.5.3 2013-19-03 1
 (No Facebook login) App doesn't let you log in via Facebook, which is how I log in on the web.

Version 2.5.3 2013-19-03 5
 (fantastic) works great

Version 2.5.3 2013-18-03 5
 (Great travel options) I love the variety and the cool places you can stay!

Version 2.5.3 2013-17-03 4
 (Useful Travel App) My husband and I stayed in this amazing tree house on the Big Island of Hawaii after finding and booking it on this app. 
I love Airbnb, however the app is a little glitchy/slow on the iPhone 4S. It's fun to browse the app, but the website is much more efficient for booking.

Version 2.5.3 2013-16-03 5
 (Love at first type!) Amazingly perfect.

Version 2.5.3 2013-16-03 4
 (Wish App had full functionality) Love the App but there are some quirks and things you can't do on it that you can do from the website (like refer friends).

Also, be aware that there is a SERVICE FEE ADDED to tenants' bill AFTER booking. It's hidden until you've booked. Not nice.

Version 2.5.3 2013-16-03 3
 (Good app, but needs a few more bells for renters) I've been using the App for a few weeks and its super easy.  I mainly use it right now to check emails from potential renters.  However, I wish it had a better calendar system on it so I can check the availability of my rental down the road.  That's ultimately why I'm giving this app a 3-star rating.

Version 2.5.3 2013-16-03 5
 (Great App, Even Better Company) The app is amazing. The company is amazing. Great way to travel. Great way to make some $.

Version 2.5.3 2013-16-03 5
 (Great app) Great app to have if you like to travel! It's fun to browse and if you do have a trip planned its nice to have the stay info accessible from the app. I used it a ton on my trip to Puerto Rico

Version 2.5.3 2013-15-03 5
 (Great app) This is a great app. Does everything it should. Very user friendly. And we love airbnb!

Version 2.5.3 2013-15-03 5
 (Wonderful service... great Ap!) I was new to the airbnb concept, downloaded Ap to iPhone, searched properties for dates I needed, contacted host, negotiated a price, and booked the property ... all from my iPhone using the Ap!  Great service, easy to use and intuitive Ap!  You won't regret using either!

Version 2.5.3 2013-14-03 5
 (Great!) I love to travel but don't always have the funds to do it as much as I'd like. Airbnb is great for finding places that fit my budget. The app is incredibly easy to use. Pictures are accurate as well. Love!

Version 2.5.3 2013-14-03 5
 (Superb app!) Airbnb has really done their homework on this one.  Perfect!

Version 2.5.3 2013-14-03 3
 (Decent app) The places on airbnb look great, but the host takes a while to reply sometimes. Some have never replied. One should not post their place if they don't plan on replying. The places I have stayed are very nice and well kept.

Version 2.5.2 2013-14-03 4
 (Love this app!) This app is amazing! Allows you to search and use filters to find the results you are looking for! Also, it keeps you in constant touch with the owners. Wonderful! I just wish I could specify a desired neighborhood. That's my ONLY con!

Version 2.5.2 2013-13-03 5
 (Wonderful company and great app!) Love Airbnb and have had a great experience using the app.

Version 2.5.1 2013-13-03 4
 (AirBnb Love!) I like the AirBnb idea and service a lot! and I like the App because it helps me being efficient in replying also when I'm traveling or I don't have my laptop with me. Keep on improving it ;-) Awesome job guys!

Version 2.5.2 2013-13-03 5
 (Flawless App) This app is great. It makes an already convenient website even more accessible. You can access all your bookings, contact hosts, and even book and pay for new trips on the app. Never crashes and very simple to navigate.

Version 2.5.2 2013-13-03 5
 (Excellent) Can't find the payment tracking though?

Version 2.5.2 2013-13-03 5
 (Great app!) I love Airbnb! This app just makes it so much easier!!!

Version 2.5.2 2013-12-03 4
 (Has exactly the features you need on the road) The AirBnB app is easy to use and has just the features you need when you're on the road: specifically, it's very easy to use the app to track your reservations, get directions, contact your host, and leave feedback when your stay is done. For actual research / booking I'd stick with the website, unless you're in a last-minute pinch.

Version 2.5.2 2013-12-03 5
 (Yes) Love it

Version 2.5.2 2013-11-03 4
 (Come on, we can do better) I am a very seasoned air bnb user and this app needs a lot of work. There is a lot going on but since you are an internet company your apps should rock. And rock bigtime. Come on, no dedicated iPad app? Clumsy interface? Passbook is a good addition but i would love to see you raise the bar.

Version 2.5.2 2013-11-03 5
 (Love it) Great help

Version 2.5.1 2013-11-03 2
 (Great App now flooded w/ realtors) This app was great when not so many people knew about it. Now there's more available, more and more realtors and hotels have flooded this market. Most likely get more congested. Wish Airbnb monitored it more.

Version 2.5.2 2013-11-03 5
 (Sweet!) Filters are great, love the photo - centric layout. Very visually stimulating.

Version 2.5.2 2013-11-03 5
 (Makes the World your neighborhood) I appreciate how accessible the world becomes with air bnb and how immersive and creative travel becomes...leaving the power to tailor your experience in your hands. The app only enhances that accessibility and promotes community even further...all the while at your fingertips. Thanks air bnb for the care evident in the execution of the idea to transform and invigorate the travel industry!

Version 2.5.2 2013-10-03 4
 (Great and convenient.) Needs an upgrade though, calendar maybe?

Version 2.5.2 2013-10-03 5
 (Love!) Great app, fantastic idea. I'm at an AirBNB place now and it's so pretty & clean & the hosts are warm & inviting.

Version 2.5.2 2013-09-03 5
 (Wonderful app) So easy to use and make air bnb life easy.

Version 2.5.2 2013-09-03 5
 (Just wonderful!) Everything about this service is top notch!

Version 2.5.2 2013-08-03 5
 (Great app) Easy to use, it's a great app

Version 2.5.2 2013-08-03 5
 (Great App, even better Service!) AirBNB is the way to stay when traveling. The app is clean, appealing, and easy to use. I love using AirBNB to find amazing places to stay when I travel!

Version 2.5.2 2013-08-03 5
 (Great app!) Awesome!

Version 2.5.2 2013-08-03 5
 (Great app) Makes booking easy!

Version 2.5.2 2013-08-03 5
 (Woo) Hoo!

Version 2.5.2 2013-08-03 4
 (iPad Version PLEASE!) Really like this app. Please, please, please make an iPad version with a little more functionality. Would defn give five stars then.

Version 2.5.2 2013-07-03 5
 (This app has NEVER let me down) If you are traveling this app is a must to locate homes to stay at wether its one night or a month! Highly recommend

Version 2.5.2 2013-07-03 5
 (Great app and very useful service!) Used airbnb a few times now and this companion app is designed and developed well. Able to respond to hosts and browse apartments easily.

Version 2.5.2 2013-07-03 5
 (Easy. Great.) 'Nuff said

Version 2.5.2 2013-07-03 4
 (Great App & Useful Tool!) I absolutely love this app, it's an identical replica of their site and business. The instant notifications are super useful, and it's so easy to communicate and book/host any stay! A full mobile Calendar and Guidebook feature would put it at 5 stars for me :)

Version 2.5.1 2013-06-03 4
 (Great app!) Easy to use, love all futures. Only one recommendation: when someone is requesting to stay at our place, the app does not display the total amount. Also, once reservation is done, there is no way to look up how much are we to receive.

Version 2.5.1 2013-06-03 4
 (Good, but needs tweaks) You need to be able to price out an itinerary right in the moment, and as hosts, the calendar should be front and center. And also, signing in every single time is an incredible headache. I realize this is likely for security, but maybe you should leave it up to the user.

Version 2.5.2 2013-06-03 4
 (Awesome!) Absolutely love this app. Completely planned out trip around Europe with it!

Version 2.5.2 2013-06-03 5
 (Awesome App) I love looking at all the different places to stay! Definitely affordable too!

Version 2.5.0 2013-06-03 5
 (Airbnb fo' Eva) Best apps design. Period.

Version 2.5.2 2013-06-03 3
 (Needs one more feature) Needs to tell you how much an itinerary is worth at a glance. Otherwise it is a great app for managing your airbnb listing.

Version 2.5.1 2013-06-03 4
 (Must Hate Dogs) If you had the option of filtering by dog friendly joints you'd be getting five stars, my airbnb friends.  Other than that great app.

Version 2.5.1 2013-05-03 1
 (Awful for hosting PLEASE CREATE A DASHBOARD!) This app is nearly useless as a host. It does not provide the dashboard to control your properties and does not show prices for inquiries. It allows nowhere near as many options as the normal website and is incredibly frustrating. The actual website is wonderful so I do not know how this app falls so short.

Version 2.5.1 2013-05-03 5
 (Awesome app and company!) Airbnb is awesome to work with and do a great job of connecting travelers with people who have interesting homes to share

Version 2.5.1 2013-04-03 5
 (The best) We had an amazing experience and look forward to many more!

Version 2.5.1 2013-03-03 5
 (Must have!) Airbnb is an incredible site. It's brilliant. I have met some of the most incredible people ever, & have been 100% satisfied with every place I've stayed at. I've yet to have a bad experience yet. I highly recommend.

Version 2.5.1 2013-03-03 5
 (Awesome) Awesome app

Version 2.5.1 2013-03-03 5
 (Great App) Love the AIRBNB app.  Easy to use while on the go, great response time, and great layout.  Makes traveling a breeze !

Version 2.5.1 2013-03-03 5
 (Great App) A must have to travel and host. I've tried other sites and other apps but airbnb is by far the best!!

Version 2.5.0 2013-02-03 5
 (My favorite app!) I love AirBnB. I don't book hotels or stay in places any other way anymore. The app has a clean design and intuitive navigation style making it easy to search for places or communicate back and fourth with hosts.

Version 2.5.1 2013-01-03 5
 (Love it) Great app

Version 2.5.1 2013-27-02 5
 (V) I LOVE the Airbnb ap when I'm traveling!!

Version 2.5.1 2013-27-02 5
 (It's great) Love it

Version 2.5.1 2013-27-02 3
 (Basic functions ok; lots of crashes in host features) This last update introduced a lot of bugs for me. The app crashes when I access host features like adding pictures or leaving a guest review.

Version 2.5.1 2013-27-02 4
 (Very Handy App!!) I do a lot of traveling and this app always helps me find places

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-02 4
 (Very good) The app isn't as versatile as the website on a desktop, but whose is? It's still easy to work with. I use the desktop to do my searching, and the app to manage once I've booked. Very nice.

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-02 5
 (Love the app - Booked Guest Room Immediately after listing my space. Awesome Safe and User Friendly.) Immediately after listing my guest room I booked a reservation for a lovely couple that were unable to secure a hotel room last minute due to everything being sold out. The inquires and reservations have been on a daily basis and I LOVE the app and website for all the obvious reasons. Thank you AirBnb,

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-02 5
 (The travel bug!) This is one of the most amazing ideas! Makes me want to travel even more!

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-02 5
 (Finding tenants made fun, sharing what I love, helping people & getting paid for it! Airbnb rocks!!) The benefits of Airbnb are amazing!... Think about what happens when you know you are going to host some guests: You clean up your home, put out your most inspiring stuff to share, courageously anticipate letting new people into your world, discover assets and income you didn't know was there, all with full coverage insurance and partners that provide world class, quality service etc. etc. - Airbnb is a humanitarian cornerstone in a new sharing economy that puts hope  and prosperity back into people's hearts.

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-02 5
 (Love AIRBNB and my Brazilian rental.) I used AIR BNB to book an apartment in Rio De Janeiro, the apartment was phenomenal and the experience using the service was flawless. I will never use a hotel again!

Version 2.5.1 2013-25-02 5
 (GREAT IDEA!!!) I love the concept of this website and app! I look forward to using this app in the future when I'm traveling or need to get away. Simple and easy to use, and I love being able to see each room with reviews and amazing photos.

Version 2.5.1 2013-24-02 5
 (This app makes me want to travel!) I haven't used any of the services yet but I love the look and feel and the concept of this app! I can't wait to actually book something!

Version 2.5.1 2013-23-02 1
 (Frustrating disappointment) The app doesn't show the wish lists created on the desktop site or show changes you've made to your wish lists. As a result its almost worthless. Also, it doesn't display all the listings it says it has. Inked one page is visible. A real disappointment.

Version 2.5.1 2013-22-02 5
 (Impeccable) Facile à utiliser, et qui permet de répondre rapidement aux éventuels locataires. Très pratique également en cas de recherche de location

Version 2.5.1 2013-22-02 5
 (Love it) Great app

Version 2.5.1 2013-21-02 5
 (Amazing) Beautifully designed app. Simple to use. Great compliment to web site.

Version 2.5.1 2013-21-02 5
 (Love it!) Need a place right away?  This is the app...  I have a wife and 4 kids and can find a place faster and either comparable or way less than a measly cheap motel room...  Worth it ALL DAY LONG :)

Version 2.5.1 2013-20-02 5
 (Wonderful appl!) I love that I can view all when all my guests are coming and going.  It's o easy to reply back to emails and such via the phone appl.  A must have!

Version 2.5.1 2013-20-02 5
 (Love my airbnb) Great computer application, very easy to use and well thought out. My rental business is really heating up and I am excited to be lucky enough to do this very well. Love it!

Version 2.5.1 2013-20-02 4
 (Airbub rookie) 1st time using this app. App provides endless options and fairly easy to maneuver and reasonable prices.  Looking forward to booking my 1st rental.

Version 2.5.1 2013-20-02 5
 (its ok) fixed my rating

Version 2.5.1 2013-20-02 4
 (Thrilling!!) I am about to book my first stay with Airbnb and I can not wait.  This app really puts fun back into lodging options.  The best part is that you get to interact with great new people.  I love adventures and can't wait to embark on my first with Airbnb.

Version 2.5.1 2013-20-02 3
 (Lacking filters) The app doesn't have all the filters that the desktop site does. This makes searching with it a pain!

Version 2.5.1 2013-20-02 5
 (Fantastic, beautiful and easy to use) Couldn't imagine life without this app. A  must use for the traveller an not the tourist

Version 2.5.1 2013-19-02 5
 (The new age of travel) This app makes using airbnb and traveling that much easier and efficient. App helps you find a play to stay last minute as well as gives you immediate access to your entire trip itinerary. It seems like the 'meetup' part of the app is still in the works but will terrific when more people start using it!

Version 2.5.1 2013-19-02 4
 (ALMOST perfect!) Airbnb needs to fix 'Leave a review' ... app keeps crashing. Otherwise, I love it!

Version 2.5.1 2013-18-02 1
 (Poorly designed) For one thing the app lacks a search engine. Secondly you can not access your dashboard or contact or respond to potential clients. I really don't see any use at all for this app except to advertise the service.  Airbnb is a wonderful company which provides a useful service but this app has been useless to me.

Version 2.5.1 2013-18-02 4
 (So fun!) This app makes it so easy to plan my next wonderful vacation from the comforts of my own bed on my phone. So easy!  And love the interface.  One thing I would say is that you can't change your reservations from the app. In addition, the wish list is not on the main menu which is not that convenient.

Version 2.5.1 2013-18-02 5
 (The awesomest) Five big stars for making my life easier by being able to accept and confirm reservations regardless where I am.

Version 2.5.1 2013-17-02 5
 (Love It!! 👍👍) I find this app. & website to be incredibly helpful in planning trips, it's a great way to travel. Making (real) connections & immediately knowing where to go. Essentially getting a crash course on almost ANY destination, I think that these qualities are intangible!! AirBnB fills a worldwide market in a welcoming, warm as you want way!!!

Version 2.5.1 2013-16-02 4
 (Great But Still Far From Perfect) For any traveler the airbnb app is simply perfect but for us hosts there are still a few tweaks that should be made

For starters I wish that old messages that i delete from the website itself also disappear instead of sitting there for months end. Second of all for travelers asking for special deals I wish I could see how much they're being charged along with the date and number of guests. Finally much like the website I wish I could click on booked dates in the calander to see who's coming that day

Version 2.5.1 2013-16-02 5
 (Fit for purpose) Easy to use app. I love the add to passbook for easy access to reservations.

Version 2.5.1 2013-16-02 4
 (Listing) Would love an iPad app

Version 2.5.1 2013-15-02 4
 (Great!) I love AirBnB, and there app is very helpful to keep on top of the ins and outs of their service!!

Version 2.5.1 2013-15-02 5
 (Great way to travel) I love this app. It is easy and simple. The one thing i would add is on the sidebar you should be able to see the places that you saved. Other than that this app is fantastic and I highly recommend it!!

Version 2.5.1 2013-15-02 5
 (Very helpful) Great app.

Version 2.5.1 2013-14-02 5
 (Great app, great service) Only used airbnb once so far, but had an amazing experience. Never staying in a hotel again if I have any say! Try it out!

Version 2.5.1 2013-14-02 5
 (why ever use a hotel again?) this app is so easy I would laugh at anyone who wastes money on a hotel again. just dl the airbnb app and your life will become so much simpler when traveling. better locations and cool people await around every turn.

Version 2.5.1 2013-14-02 5
 (Only used AirBnB on our 3 month S America trip) We only used AirBnB on our 3 month South America trip and it was fantastic. Everywhere we went people were saying how much they paid for hostels/hotels/etc and then they would hear how much we paid. I think I convinced about ten people to use the app while traveling.

Version 2.5.1 2013-13-02 5
 (Saved $$$ and had more fun!) Used this app extensively during my medical residency interview season. I saved huge amounts of money, met cool people, and had way more fun than if I had stayed alone in a hotel. I heart AirBnB!

Version 2.5.1 2013-13-02 2
 (Terrible on the iPad, good on the iPhone) It's just not functioning on the iPad

Version 2.5.1 2013-12-02 4
 (Great but) Wished they had an iPad version, annoying having to use this app and not have full potential of entire screen even with 2x

Version 2.5.1 2013-12-02 5
 (great and easy app) very easy to use. very intuitive. airbnb beats using a hotel so this app is great to find a place while on the go.

Version 2.5.0 2013-12-02 4
 (Mondrian unit 403) Wonderful location with host Myron there to great me.  The condo was delivered as expected,  clean and in good repair. I would surely stay there again.

Version 2.5.1 2013-11-02 4
 (Need to able to add existing photos) Great app! But users should be able to add existing photos from iPhone.

Version 2.5.0 2013-11-02 5
 (Love it!) Fantastic app and service.

Version 2.5.1 2013-11-02 5
 (Change the way you travel!) As a current user i can say that Airbnb gives you a chance to really design your own vacation while working harmoniously with your budget. Explore luxury like 5 star options or seclude yourself from the world in a modern mountainous hideaway. There's no marketplace like Airbnb, so do yourself a favor and stop being a tourist and start being a traveler!!

Version 2.5.1 2013-10-02 5
 (Nifty and beyond cool) This app has become an addiction! I love to look for new listings and it works very smoothly!

Version 2.5.1 2013-09-02 5
 (Open to fun!) This app has opened up a whole new world of travel and fun. It's a very thrifty way to travel and enjoy places you would not usually be able to afford.

Version 2.5.1 2013-09-02 4
 (Good app for Tryin to book a cheap vacation) I listed my listing House of the Doggz surf vacation house and it was easy to set up, easy to upload pictures and overall a good way to get my house outt here. Check it out

Version 2.5.1 2013-08-02 4
 (Love to travel) This place is awesome. I just started prepping my place so that I can host. Would be able to update and edit postings and profile from app.

Version 2.5.1 2013-08-02 4
 (I love me some Airbnb) It's true - I'm a big fan. I've only hosted thus far, but will be using the service as a guest in November. 

One thing: the website and app are buggy. The app crashes, and the website did strange things to the ad for my apartment. 

Other than that, excellent service!

Version 2.5.1 2013-08-02 3
 (Works but could use some improvements) Needs links and more directives to add more photos and edit profile text

Version 2.5.1 2013-07-02 3
 (Love) Love love it 1000x

Version 2.5.1 2013-05-02 4
 (Good but could be better) It works fine, but could be better if we could upload photos from iPhone's camera roll.

Version 2.5.1 2013-04-02 5
 (Works Great) Great app, faster and easier than using the actual website.

Version 2.5.1 2013-04-02 5
 (Amazing app!) Great idea. It's all over the world.

Version 2.5.1 2013-03-02 1
 (Lame app) Crashed after I left a review, and left me with no way of knowing if the review was accepted.

Version 2.5.1 2013-03-02 5
 (Airbnb) All you need

Version 2.5.1 2013-03-02 5
 (:)) Well done.

Version 2.5.1 2013-02-02 4
 (Great Company) Love AirBNB and the app is near perfect. Highly recommend.

Version 2.5.1 2013-02-02 5
 (Awesome App, Awesome product) This app and product will blow your mind. You will find awesome places at great rates in every place you can imagine. Also, this app is very intuitive and extremely user friendly, highly recommended!

Version 2.5.1 2013-02-02 4
 (Love airbnb) And the app does it justice

Version 2.5.1 2013-01-02 5
 (Fantástico..) Hermosos lugares descubiertos

Version 2.5.1 2013-31-01 5
 (Awesome) Great app

Version 2.5.1 2013-31-01 5
 (Great App!) Allows me to manage my listing from the iPhone, have found it very useful and well put together in communicating and setting up reservations for guests & myself.

Version 2.5.1 2013-31-01 5
 (Smooth UI and Simple Booking Process) This app is solid.

Version 2.5.1 2013-31-01 2
 (iPad app?) Really ? No iPad app? I find that hard to believe kind of a pain in the but

Version 2.5.1 2013-30-01 5
 (Love it!) The app is great and the service is great!  Let the airbnb be!

Version 2.5.1 2013-29-01 5
 (Amazing) Love this company, love this app.

Version 2.5.1 2013-29-01 4
 (Awesome) The air bnb app makes it super easy to access all of your tasks from the comfort of your own phone wherever you are. So glad to have it.

Version 2.5.1 2013-29-01 3
 (Decent app) Good usability overall, but missing most features (I can't really edit my property details).

Version 2.5.1 2013-29-01 4
 (Great!) I love airbnb for travel!

Version 2.5.1 2013-28-01 4
 (Love air bnb) I would def recommend using air bnb for your upcoming travel. :)

Version 2.2.3 2013-27-01 4
 (Looking forward to a great experience in Paris with AirBnB) I heard so many great stories and I am really excited to try it out!

Version 2.5.1 2013-27-01 5
 (Awesome) Super easy to make arrangements to stay in nice places quickly

Version 2.5.1 2013-27-01 5
 (Recibo todos mis mjes al instante!) Es tan fácil de usar que no pierdes ni 1 minuto chequeando tus búsquedas, mensajes o lo que sea. Las opciones son geniales!

Version 2.5.1 2013-27-01 5
 (Easy peasy) Makes it so quick to accept reservations and search for places to stay!  I love the updated version with the ability to change the calendar. They just keep getting everything right!!

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-01 5
 (Love this company) And the app is great too, especially the newly updated version. Great concept, makes it possible for anyone to share their home safely and meet nice people!

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-01 5
 (Easy to manage reservations at my fingertips!) We recently started using Airbnb to rent out an extra room in our house. Not only have we enjoyed hosting interesting guests in our homes, but Airbnb makes the whole process a snap! I get text message alerts whenever some inquires about renting the room, and can easily respond or look for more information on the app. It make it easy to manage our posting from anywhere! We use both the iPhone and iPad apps, in addition to the website.

Version 2.5.0 2013-26-01 5
 (A true life saver!) The combination of this idea and this application has been a true lifesaver for me.  To my knowledge there's no better way to find pre-verified and prequalified people to stay in your home.  Thank you airbnb and keep it up!

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-01 5
 (Great app) Just download it. You gonna love it.

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-01 5
 (Simple and easy) I've been traveling for months now, setting up places to stay as well as renting my own property while I'm away, has been absolutely easy and awesome.  ...if only we could get landscape mode for iPad!!

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-01 5
 (Love it!) I love this app AND website! Now they just need to create an iPad app :-)

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-01 4
 (Boa experiência) Bom app

Version 2.5.1 2013-26-01 5
 (Great app.) Perfect app for Airbnb. Makes booking and hosting super easy.

 (Better than staying at a hotel) The app is very user friendly and very reliable. Reservations are easily made and works just like the full website.

Version 2.5.0 2013-23-01 4
 (Al oSt 5 star ;)) Great App! I am a Host and so far I cannot figure out how to update my listing. That is the only issue I can see....and it may be capable of doing that - I just do not see how, YET ;) if nothing else,  I would think it needs to be more clearly defined how hosts can update the property description. THANKS AIRBNB! Swan Hill B&B and Lake Cabin love you!

 (Private room with private entrance.) To put it simply, Adam and Sophie we're a fun loving couple with a wonderful atmosphere. The room cozy with a plush bathroom.

Version 2.5.0 2013-22-01 5
 (Great service) I love airbnb. It's the only way we will travel from now on. The app is so convenient too!

Version 2.5.0 2013-22-01 5
 (Perfect way to keep up!) I have been using airbnb for a few months as a host and soon to be guest. This app is fantastic. I am often not at a computer so this is crucial to me so that I can respond in a timely manner to inquires. 

Thanks!

Version 2.5.0 2013-22-01 5
 (Très facile d'utilisation et très pratique. Merci.) Parfait

 (Super app. Easy, handy and quick.) Love it!

Version 2.5.0 2013-21-01 5
 (Works perfect.) This is a great app that is easy to use and functional. We loved air b&b as guest and now we are host. I use the app all the time and almost never use the full site now. Couldn't be happier with this awesome service.

Version 2.5.0 2013-20-01 5
 (Superb) Fantastic app for a fantastic service. Thank you!

Version 2.2.0 2013-20-01 5
 (Great!) I'm both an Airbnb host and guest, and this app is super helpful.

Version 2.5.0 2013-20-01 5
 (Great app for travel!) The map feature is great for finding a spot when on the move- logging in from a non mobile device gives you more in depth options like reviews and references but the app works great.

Version 2.5.0 2013-18-01 4
 (Ms) I love everything about the airbnb concept. 
With regards to the app and some of the recent updates, I find that the interface went from being clean and straightforward to a little murky and unnecessary. 
My main gripe is the favourites/wishlists. For any perso. Browsing or planning, it is obviously one of the most important features, I like that you have added the ability to create specific lists but it is annoying and initially it was kind of confusing because you add something to a list and the drop down stays on the screen waiting for you to do something... Too many taps and untapping things by accident. 

The wishlist is also nowhere to be seen when you open the app and surprisingly it isn't even in the sidebar, you have to go into your profile to find your wishlists and it seems very deprioritised In terms of the UI menu hierarchy. I find myself always wanting much more Immediate access to it.

Version 2.5.0 2013-17-01 5
 (Easy on the go) Easy to use

Version 2.5.0 2013-15-01 5
 (Amazing) My first time booking with airbnb... Love the place I stayed in Paris, it was perfect better then hotel. Privacy and able to be part of the city and the surrounding. I will use airbnb for all my travel. It gave the city of Love Paris more Love then I could ask for it was perfect.

Version 2.5.0 2013-15-01 5
 (Love this app!) I've used airbnb three times for European travel. On 2 trips, I stayed with hosts & on my upcoming trip, I've reserved a private flat. The hosts I stayed with were absolutely wonderful people & I would recommend them to anyone. It saved me a fortune & I learned things about the cities I would have never known had I not stayed with a local.

Version 2.5.0 2013-15-01 3
 (Great App, Inaccurate availability listings) The app is fine, airbnb is a great concept that often works well. The problem is people who list places that are not really available, it is very time consuming and difficult to plan a trip with this problem. Airbnb needs to deal with listers who can not manage their listing and waste everyone's time. For my recent booking to San Francisco I finally got a hotel after many listers either did not respond or said it was unavailable though listed as available.

Version 2.5.0 2013-15-01 5
 (Even Better) I just got the new upgrade and I love the way I can view my upcoming guests. I think I'll rely on the iPad more now. Thanks!

Version 2.5.0 2013-14-01 5
 (Good & Good For You) A great app and even better customer service. We booked and had a bad experience only to have all our problems solved

Version 2.5.0 2013-14-01 3
 (Issues with responding to customers) I love this ap, but recently, I've been having issues when trying to respond to inquiries from customers trying to make a booking with me. It will ONLY allow me to send a special offer, but not leave or attach a message in any way that I can see. I'm using the site on my browser instead until this gets fixed.

Version 2.5.0 2013-14-01 5
 (It's nice) It's nice

Version 2.5.0 2013-13-01 5
 (A perfect way to travel) I live this concept and it brings you much more in touch with the authenticity of a location. You can live like a local and cut down on restaurant eating and meet fantastic people! As both parties are reviewed it makes it more save to meet since no one wants to ruin their reputation ...

Version 2.5.0 2013-13-01 5
 (Brilliant) As a guest or a host, it's efficient and you meet cool people wherever you go. Hotels are so 2.0.

Version 2.5.0 2013-12-01 5

Version 2.5.0 2013-11-01 5
 (Love to browse this app!) Easy to use. I just booked a room in minutes. All my info is stored.  I love the air bnb picks and neighborhoods!  I have discovered so many places to consider in my travels.  Have had great luck with places we've stayed.  No complaints here.

Version 2.5.0 2013-09-01 4
 (Login Problem) I love the app. My one complaint is that every time I try to login, the app kicks me out. Any suggestions or solutions? 
Thanks
Van

Version 2.5.0 2013-09-01 5
 (Love it!) Love the easy user interface! Very clean and simple design. Love the way I am able to view my wish lists.

Version 2.5.0 2013-09-01 2
 (Missing features) Good but regrettable that is not available high definition in full screen for iPad.
No sort from low to high
No sort "available from..."

Version 2.5.0 2013-08-01 3
 (Needs more extensive search filters) Works fine, but would this app would be great if they developed more filtered features like if a place has a security deposit or not.

Version 2.5.0 2013-08-01 5
 (Great App on the go) Would be nice if app had a dashboard like it does on the website for ppl who host to check metrics. Overall very user friendly app.

Version 2.5.0 2013-07-01 5
 (Great app) Helps me do everything I need to manage my account.

Version 2.5.0 2013-07-01 4
 (Easy to use) Love AirBnB as it alerts me to potential bookings on all my mobile devices and then allows me to respond or update my listings remotely! Enables me to easily maintain a 100% response rate!

Version 2.5.0 2013-07-01 5
 (Muito Bem Airbnb) This app is truly incredible. Very user friendly, beautiful images of hosts locations, very simple to navigate. Great job Airbnb.!!!!

Version 2.5.0 2013-07-01 1
 (Not good) Beware, after using this app several times I booked a place with a bad host. After discussion with the host he agreed to cancel the reservation, but airbnb still is trying to charge me $165. They will not allow customers to speak to the airbnb employee who makes the decision. I would strongly recommend using a different company like VRBO.

Version 2.5.0 2013-07-01 5

 (Used to be perfect, now crashes every time) That's pretty much it--it's a wonderful app when I can actually log into it. I've gotten an error every time I've attempted to log in since the latest update, and all my other apps/software are up to date, so wondering when this will be fixed. Does not appear that everyone is having the same trouble though...hm...anyone find a fix?

 (Literally Brilliant) This is how every iOS app should work!! Flawless, powerful, and easy to navigate.

Version 2.5.0 2013-04-01 5
 (MOST USEFUL APP EVER!!!) I constantly use apps for business, house hunting, everything really. We came to LA with very little money and high hopes. (The usual moving to Hollywood story) it took maybe 10 minutes to find the perfect place in the perfect location and 7 of those minutes were just figuring out how much the app has to offer! It really tells you everything you need to know. Searching by location was easiest. Each listing has photos, house rules, amenities, parking info, everything you need to know right there. No fees, no bs, just a credit card to book the room (which we didn't have and they let us pay cash when we got there). Everyone on this site is very different and the properties and locations are endless. I just talked to a couple of girls who used the same app all over the country. If we did not find this app we would have been lost to say the least! Thank you for this app!

Version 2.5.0 2013-04-01 5
 (Wonderful app!) Absolutely fantastic and super easy to use!

Version 2.5.0 2013-04-01 1
 (No customer service) App is fine but no customer service to back it up. You will open your home to strangers but you will not get a straight answer from airbnb if you contact them with a problem. You will not receive a return phone call. You will be told to take care of your problem yourself with your problem tenant - assuming they even show up. I'm not happy with the service. Shiny website and app backed up by 3rd world service.

Version 2.2.3 2013-04-01 5
 (From Delaware to beyond...) Airbnb is the absolute best for helping me book affordable spots all over and meeting amazing folks along the way. The app is a great way to stay in contact with property owners on the go.

Version 2.5.0 2013-02-01 5
 (Wonderful app) It's easy to use and contact host !

Version 2.5.0 2013-02-01 5
 (Really hits the spot) Wonderful app that gives you the lower of the website in an easy to use format. I use it mainly for communicating with guests, and it is indispensable.  Being able to respond to questions within minutes is extremely helpful when trying to book reservations.  A must have!

Version 2.5.0 2013-02-01 5
 (Amazing) Very easy to use app and powerful to help you plan your next trip!

Version 2.5.0 2013-01-01 5
 (Save money, travel well) We've stayed in the most unique places and met the best people because of Airbnb. It also saves us money during our extensive travels. It's so much more comfortable to stay in apartments and houses than sterile hotels. Plus we can cook our own food when we get tired of restaurant fare. Win, win, win!

Version 2.5.0 2012-31-12 5
 (Great Alternative to Hotels) Great way to travel and always act like a local

Version 2.2.3 2012-30-12 5

 (Airbnb is great) Airbnb is my only option when I travel they are the best option for any type of accommodations all over the world..

Version 2.5.0 2012-28-12 5
 (Law student) Airbnb saved my life. I needed a last minute 5 month rental in Austin, TX. I found the most wonderful hostess. Also, the customer service is second to none! I will no longer book a regular hotel.

Version 2.5.0 2012-28-12 5
 (Best Lodging experience) This is the best app. I find places last minute all the time(best to look in advance). I've had such a positive experience and feel it is much more worth it than paying an over priced hotel. All the hosts I have felt with have been super accommodating and friendly. I feel much more comfortable knowing that my hard earned cash is going to good people rather than a hotel who doesn't care for your concerns. I recommend this to anyone who travels often or just for a quick getaway. You will always find what u are looking for and more. I can't rave enough! Thank you!

Version 2.5.0 2012-27-12 2
 (Can't log in) Every time I try to log into the app the app crashes. It does not work for a host who is trying to access the functionality, needs to be improved. The web site works great and the concept is terrific but the user login is not working.

Version 2.5.0 2012-27-12 3
 (Simply Savvy) As a huge supporter of Airbnb, I enjoy using the simple interface of their app. I would like to see the following improvements, however:
- refined search capabilities ie. ability to click on a map, choose state, borough, or area. 
- more detailed filters ie. search box that allows me to enter exactly what it is I'm looking for.

Version 2.5.0 2012-27-12 5
 (A traveler's dream) I never knew this existed and now that I do I feel cheated for wasting thousands upon thousands of dollars at hotels. This app is the epitome of social media greatness.

Version 2.5.0 2012-27-12 5
 (AirBnB made our trip work) AirBnB allowed us to find 2 great apartments for our family if 5 in the nicest part of Istanbul. It worked flawlessly.

Version 2.5.0 2012-26-12 5

 (Efficient and Worthwhile) Love the app!

Version 2.4.0 2012-25-12 5
 (Great app, great company!) Love love love air bnb. The app needs to allow you to review your guest! It would be so helpful to not have to wait until you get to a laptop to do so...

Version 2.5.0 2012-23-12 4
 (App is good, but could be great!) My one complaint with the app is when someone new makes a booking request, it is unclear how much it is for. This particularly poses problems when I have special prices set for certain days.

Version 2.5.0 2012-22-12 3
 (Host) This app is helpful as a host but its really geared towards guest. All the updates must be for the iPhone 5. I have a iPhone 4 and am very limited what I can do with the app. 

I can't view my calendar, update properties, write reviews nor can I message potential guest from my inbox and see what I'm typing in the message field once it reaches a certain area.

The newest updated didn't do anything that could be helpful for me. 

Other than that Airbnb is a great site and a great way to host trusted 
people from all over the world.

Version 2.4.0 2012-22-12 5
 (Love it) Great app

 (A New Era Is Ushered In For Travelers) This is the Best Website Ever!!!!!

Version 2.4.0 2012-22-12 4
 (AirBnB is a life-changing app) I researched a number of websites before deciding to list our guest cabin on Airbnb. I give Airbnb 5 stars for their model to connect individuals with one another. The app works flawlessly but  is still missing a key feature for hosts: it lacks access to view and edit the calendar.

Other than that issue, the Airbnb app is ABSOLUTELY essential to be successful as a host. Instant notification of requests for info and requests to make a reservation are so, so, so essential to be able to know immediately what the guest wants (reservation, question, info). With the amazing instant notification feature, I'm able to respond to the prospective guest within a few minutes or less.

In overnight rentals, it he first bird gets the booking.  If you're a host, you can't afford not to eek out a little space on your iPhone, install this app

Version 2.4.0 2012-22-12 5

 (Fluctuating Currency Settings) Please update this app. Apparently, the currency settings are not being honored in the features section of the app. The price fluctuates with different currencies every time I open the app. It is not very helpful to glance at locals to see prices in Thai Baht or in English Pounds when what I want to see are prices in dollars. Thanks!

Version 2.4.0 2012-18-12 5
 (Kewl app) Vrrryy kewl

Version 2.2.3 2012-13-12 5
 (Great App for People that Love to Travel) I was a bit intimidated by airbnb'ng at first as I had never traveled that way but had hosted people before through similar websites. However I love airbnb and their app. They are always quick to respond with help or questions you might have, the app is like a mini notebook with all of your notes for your trip. Very useful, very organized.

Version 2.4.0 2012-13-12 5
 (Great app) Useful, for real.

Version 2.4.0 2012-12-12 3
 (New app needs calendar editing ability) I love AirBnb, its service, and its design, but the new app isn't great for hosts. There's no ability to edit or update your calendar. That's nuts. Fix that and it'll be a great app.

Version 2.4.0 2012-11-12 5
 (Life changing) It's truly amazing when an app can literally open a whole new world to you. I had no idea places like these were available to rent. This app will now be my companion for every future trip!

Version 2.4.0 2012-11-12 5
 (Entrepreneur) I don't write reviews. However, this app and AirBnB have helped me raise $3,000 in 2 months for a 9' x 5' room and provided me more options that I didn't know existed.

Version 2.3.0 2012-11-12 4
 (Great) Great app!! A simple alternative to hotels- fun way to check listings . 

 2 details prevent this app from getting perfect 5 stars score: 1st there is no "sort". No option to organize results based on price or amount of reviews. 

2nd it's a bit difficult to define geographical parameters, for instance, looking for places in manhattan will also show places in Brooklyn. 

Small details easy to resolve by developers.

Version 2.3.0 2012-11-12 4
 (Super convenient) The app makes pulling up info on the go really easy!

Version 2.2.0 2012-09-12 5
 (Very well designed and easy to use) The only complaint is I've had problems searching by a certain price

Version 2.3.0 2012-09-12 4
 (Old version was better) Recently the application switched from bottom navigation buttons to the current version. I found the older version better easier to use. No iPad support yet.

When traveling, the application is increasingly useful though. The one time I used AirBnb when traveling, I didn't feel the need to bring a computer at all.

Version 2.3.0 2012-07-12 3
 (Good app but location drains battery) This is a good app that is frequently upgraded. I would like to bring to the attention of developers that enabling the location bases services drains the battery. Even when the app isn't opened, location is used and uses way too much of the battery. It would be great to have a fix in the future.

Version 2.3.0 2012-07-12 5
 (Great help!) I love Airbnb it's been helping me rent my apartments for almost a year now and this app helps a lot. I just wish there was a way to sync my Airbnb calendar to my phone's.  I recommend this for hosts and future travelers.

Version 2.2.1 2012-05-12 5
 (The Glorious ........) I love Air BnB!! As a performer I am constantly using this service to find rooms for cheap cheap cheap! They are always as nice or nicer than hotels. The descriptions of the rooms are always very accurate. Air BnB saves me from having to impose on my friends every time I come in town for an audition. I've never had an unpleasant experience. I will continue to use this service as long as it is available :-)

Version 2.3.0 2012-04-12 1

Version 2.2.3 2012-04-12 4
 (Best app in my phone) Makes finding a place to stay and adventure. Wish it could sort by price and features like parking. Otherwise of give it a 5 star

Version 2.2.3 2012-02-12 2
 (Very limited unless using a desktop) So far I've had to call the site and have them verify simple things like my phone number. It's confusing, but I'm sure after everything is set up it will be useful. I just have to use a desktop version not my iPhone.

Version 2.2.3 2012-02-12 5
 (Awesome) This app should be number one the appstore cuz it is first in economy first in enthusiasm in traveling and also in social networking greatttttttttttttttt from now i won't saty in any hotel cuz i have the airbnb app

Version 2.2.3 2012-02-12 1
 (Great concept but needs improving) Here are the experiences I've had with Airbnb so far:

1. I booked a place in Santa Barbara. Unfortunately we had a tragedy the day before the trip so needed to cancel the reservation. The cancellation cost me 50% of the booking, around $500. The owner offered me to use the place another time but I can't find another time to visit Santa Barbara, and can't recover the $500 cancellation fee. 
2. I reserved a place in ShenZhen, China, but then discovered the address of the apartment was no where near the location on the map shown on Airbnb, i.e. the location I wanted to be in. Other apartments also had this map placement problem. Apparently Google maps also has issues displaying the correct locations in China, which may be related to this problem. I ended up having to sleep on a couch instead. 

So while I love the concept of AirBnB, it hasn't worked out for me in the first 2 cases I've made a booking :(

Version 2.2.3 2012-01-12 1
 (App prob) I go to contact host and the app brings me to the select calendar page. Then the unit says 99 for one night so I put that in and it says total 200$. 

Not cool!

Version 2.2.3 2012-01-12 4
 (Has saved me beaucoup $$$) Never travel any other way when you're young and low on cash - you still get to see the world on a budget!

 (Must Have Travel App) Very impressed with the UI and functionality of the App. I wish some of the functionality from the site were available but I'm sure that will come.

Version 2.2.3 2012-29-11 5
 (Great App) Great app for anyone that likes to travel!

Version 2.2.3 2012-28-11 5
 (Its cool but not for iPad) Why is it so hard to make an iPad version and make this perfect?

Version 2.2.3 2012-28-11 5
 (Life saver!) Great for booking a room at the last minute. I only wish they could get rid of the delay between when messages arrive in the app and when they arrive in your email inbox...

Version 2.2.3 2012-28-11 5
 (Good app) Great app. Love it.

Version 2.2.3 2012-28-11 5

 (Slick app, great service) AirBnB is a solid renting service that offers a very different take on vacations than a hotel room.

The service itself is great and transactions feel safe.  As for the app, very convenient and easy to use.

Version 2.2.3 2012-25-11 5
 (Unbelievable and reliable!) I use Air BnB and its great! I rely on it as much as I rely on my GPS. I use it to book a place and communicate with my  hosts. My stays, because of this app, have been fantastic!

Version 2.2.3 2012-24-11 5
 (I love ABnB) I was a guest in 3 ABnB listings while traveling in Israel October. I was a first time user and certainly will consider the site as my #1 source for foreign and domestic travel in the future

Version 2.2.3 2012-24-11 4
 (Good app but) Needs more features for hosts!  Calendar and pricing most important!

Version 2.2.3 2012-23-11 5
 (Awesome!) If you use Airbnb, this app won't disappoint!

Version 2.2.3 2012-22-11 5
 (Love this app) This app helps dreaming girls like me makes those dreams a reality!!! Thank you for making air BNB an app.  

Dreams really do come true!!!

Version 2.2.3 2012-21-11 5
 (Nice!) Pretty cool idea!  No more over priced hotels!

Version 2.2.3 2012-21-11 5
 (Very convenient) It's useful to have when you are shuttling between apartments!

Version 2.2.3 2012-21-11 5
 (Love it) Just had my first guest - the app made it super easy!

Version 2.2.3 2012-21-11 5
 (Loveeee this app!) So awesome I love to travel and this app is perfect

Version 2.2.3 2012-21-11 5
 (Very happy) Great website, great App. Extremely happy!

Version 2.2.3 2012-20-11 3
 (AMAZING service, but limited iOS functionality.) Being almost 100% mobile, I need to manage my property with an intuitive app, but it falls short of being able to effectively do so. From errors during login to limited functionality, you are better off using their website. I LOVE airbnb, but they need schooled in mobile needs and UI design.

Version 2.2.3 2012-20-11 4
 (5 stars) This app is great and extremely easy to navigate. I was able to make vacation plans without using my laptop once. But I give it 4 stars because some financial aspects are not viewable until checkout (such as the deposit, in some case). However, everything else is great including the messaging system and the push notifications.

Version 2.2.3 2012-20-11 4
 (Sent?) Where are messages sent? Not sure if messages went out? Overall great concept.

Version 2.2.3 2012-19-11 4
 (Great, user friendly app) Everything just works well. I just hope they have all the features of the site in the app too. Nonetheless its user friendly and well thought app.

Version 2.2.3 2012-19-11 2
 (Airbnb is obv gr8, but the fact that they dont have ipad app??) Ok, obv the airbnb concept is great and it is blowing up. They are also expanding into detailing variances in neighhborhoods aiding people to be even more satisfied with their experiences. However why does airbnb not have an ipad app yet. Thumbing through places on iphone can be a headache. Their service is blowing up and it has been for a while and yet they are unable to come up with the funding it takes to put an ipad app on the market yet? Who is managing this company??? They are on a gold mine and they dont even know how to mine gold.

Version 2.2.3 2012-17-11 2
 (Lots of bugs) The app is great for looking up places to stay. However, if you book a room and it is not available for the nights you want it, then you cancel said reservation and rebook it for only the night that it is available, the app says that you cannot rebook because you already have booked it. Hmmmm...so I called customer service ( on hold 7 minutes) to find out that the app is riddled with glitches and bugs and that it is best to open air b&b in a web browser and avoid the app. When I opened in a web browser it showed my pending request but it will not appear in the app. They told me that it will be some time before the app is fully functioning.

Version 2.2.3 2012-17-11 5
 (Great travel app! Must have!) I just made my first booking through this app for a BnB in Bangkok. It was super easy, very quick response and inexpensive! I will definitely use this app for all travel bookings in the future!

Version 2.2.3 2012-17-11 5
 (wow!) super awesome app! im planning a 2 month stay in argentina next summer and then a travelling-nomad-extravaganza thru the US next fall/winter ... this app/site is a super helpful tool!

Version 2.2.3 2012-16-11 5
 (Love!) Such a great app!

Version 2.2.3 2012-14-11 4
 (Works great!) I'm used to using the full site, but the app was great for being on the road and finding a last-minute stay. I wish the host calendar was easier to find, but the "I need a place tonight" feature helps make up for that.

Version 2.2.3 2012-13-11 3
 (Missing The best Features of Website) The app is great in terms of usability, but lacking in functionality. I was disappointed when I searched lodge, and there were no results! Really? Then searched tree house and again nothing... only came up with 20 listings ALL in steamboat springs, CO, and NONE of them had anything to do with tree houses! Cmon airbnb!

Version 2.2.3 2012-13-11 5
 (Cleanest and very comfy beautiful) Awesome place. Highly recommended.

Version 2.2.3 2012-12-11 4
 (Great for traveling but no good for hosts.) My wife and I are dedicated airbnb users and it allows us to travel the world while renting our house out to guests. The app works beautifully for us as we travel but does not allow us to change our calendar or review guests. When we travel in Asia, my iPhone is often the only source of Internet connection so it would be great if these management features were added.

Version 2.2.3 2012-11-11 5
 (Great places at your fingertips) The app is so easy to use but stil detailed. The search function is simple and the pics are phenomenal. You know exactly what you're getting when book thanks to reviews, maps and pictures. Using this app makes me want to travel because there are so many beautiful homes. And the rates are comparable to Expedia Travelocity etc but NICER homes

Version 2.2.3 2012-11-11 5
 (I love this App.) Awesome App. The best. Don't think I'll ever stay at a hotel/motel again.

Version 2.2.3 2012-10-11 5
 (Travelers best friend) Just finishing a two week wine trip through Oregon and Washington states where we used airbnb almost exclusively. The app was so handy because we often didn't know where we might end up each night and so needed last minute accommodations. It worked well to use the "help, I need a place tonight" feature every time. Thanks airbnb!!

Version 2.2.3 2012-10-11 5
 (A must) If you are not using this App, then you're crazy!

Version 2.2.3 2012-09-11 5
 (Airbnb) We think this concept, and this App, are so great. We've travelled the world, often staying in "regular folks" homes, and loved it. Yet, when we travel in our own country, we often staying in sterile hotels with no character and no kitchen. Why?  Because we didn't know about Airbnb. No more. Great App!  Great company!

Version 2.2.3 2012-08-11 5
 (Langrune-sur-mer Studio Apt) 2 day/nite stay, 05-06NOV12
GREAT location, across fm beach; part of Juno Canadian Dday landing areas.
Off season, quiet village; but adj Italian + Hotel de la Mer Restaurant(s) open.

Top recommendation; wld rtn!!

Version 2.2.3 2012-08-11 4
 (Cool) Cool app man.

Version 2.2.2 2012-08-11 5
 (Dream come true for any apartment Owner) The site makes me wonder why I haven't done this before? The most interesting and easy organized way of extra adventure in your life , new friends and exciting ideas for your own travels. Recommending it to anyone I know so far and using as a host and guest I'm in awe with the Idea. Brilliant.

Version 2.2.3 2012-08-11 5
 (Owners) Love AirBNB. For 6 months now we have had great responses and renters

Version 2.2.3 2012-07-11 5
 (Great app, great service.) Better than hotels and cheaper.

 (I like it, but...) Look the app is good and well design just no option for us dog lovers.

Version 2.2.3 2012-06-11 5
 (Awesome App and Service Provider) You can't help but be successful using Airbnb! Simple, thorough, and everyone loves using the service. WishI had a 6th star to give them!

Version 2.2.3 2012-06-11 5
 (Very usefull and reliable!) Really, this app surpresed me. It is very good designed and usefull, turning a hard work simply and enjoyable!

Version 2.2.3 2012-05-11 5
 (Amazing app and life-changer!) Seriously, I'm on this app every single day.   It's super easy to navigate and really changed my life.  Sounds silly but a definite $$$-maker if you have extra space and you enjoy sharing it and  providing for travelers.

Version 2.2.3 2012-05-11 4
 (Great Hosting Experience) Thanks to airbnb I've been able to make additional $$$ while sharing my large house and spare room(s), and meet nice worldly travelers. Looking forward to being a host, again and again.

Version 2.2.3 2012-05-11 5
 (Airbnb) It is a great app for booking homes

Version 2.2.3 2012-05-11 2
 (Listings are not accurate) I downloaded the app on the go and decided to make a last minute reservation. The listing stated that dog(s) were allowed under amenities. I went ahead with the reservation because it was a great location and I could bring my pets. The home owner accepted and I contacted the seller just to confirm the dogs section and they stated that it is listed as pets not accepted in their listing. I contacted airbnb customer service and they were very helpful in assisting. I went ahead and sent a screen shot of my phone for proof to both the home owner and the customer service representative to prove that this app info is incorrect. 

Great concept though.

Version 2.2.3 2012-04-11 5
 (Thank you) I am a host and just want to say " thanks"

Version 2.2.3 2012-04-11 4
 (Nice App but need some addt'l features) This app is great but you should e able to see payout history in the app and you should be able to write guest reviews in the app. You have to log into the website to do both but it would be nice if you could do these task within the app. Also, you can add pictures, however, you cannot add or edit a description for the pictures or for the property in the app. Would be a nice addition as well. Also, would be nice for check-in reminders. Otherwise, it's a great app.

Version 2.2.3 2012-04-11 4
 (Awesome) Planning my drive across country with airbnb. Love the amount of pet friendly places we are finding and the prices! What a great idea! App has made the bookings hassle free. Was able to change reservation dates so easy.  Love the ability to find thenplaces and message them right in the app.

Version 2.2.3 2012-03-11 5
 (Love) Love love love

Version 2.2.3 2012-02-11 4
 (Easy and convenient!) Easy and convenient!

Version 2.2.2 2012-01-11 5
 (I like it!) Very good app. To find the perfect vacation rentals almost anywhere!!!!

Version 2.2.3 2012-31-10 5
 (Makes your life easier) Great app and great idea for a service. The app makes your life easier because you can see your upcoming reservations without having to log on to the full site. If you're a host you should definitely have the app.

Version 2.2.3 2012-30-10 5
 (Great App, Amazing Service) Airbnb and the app are both awesome, period. But what's up with the new icon that neither reflects the uniqueness of the brand nor the fun of the spaces available inside? Please change it back!

Version 2.2.3 2012-30-10 5
 (Future of Hotel Industry) Loving this app...great graphics,easy to use,very informative and fun...

Will return for update after first booking...

Version 2.2.3 2012-28-10 4

 (Best idea ever) Great app that is very user friendly.

Version 2.2.3 2012-26-10 5
 (Excellent app!) Well designed app. Very handy with instant notifications. Booked a room last minute on the go with it. Love airbnb.

Version 2.2.3 2012-25-10 5
 (Everything Works) Superbly well put together app, coolest concept, reasonably good worrying about security and great appeal for the legitimate and coherent. 

AirBnB works well in virtually every way possible, beyond having a website that could alone smash its every competitor. 

I've been using it and cannot honestly utter any negatives, except perhaps that a few notifications failed on me; which is totally overlook-able. 

Good job lads.

Version 2.2.3 2012-25-10 1
 (Faulty privacy settings, doesn't synch with web) I set Facebook timeline posting to "off" but it still posts. You cannot stop it. 

Also doesn't synch with web site activity, wish lists don't match up and often saved properties aren't actually saved.

Version 2.2.3 2012-25-10 5
 (Great app) Just joined and just started using this app!  Great!!

 (Killer app, and it keeps getting better!) Every person I've interacted with at Airbnb has been authentic, kind, and compassionate, and it shows in everything they do.

Version 2.2.3 2012-22-10 1
 (App keeps crashing!!!) Usable!

Version 2.2.2 2012-22-10 5
 (Awesome application) Superb application..has almost every feature from the website. The search engine is good. The best feature is the direct communication with owner.

Version 2.2.3 2012-22-10 5
 (Great App) This app works great and I never have to miss a booking!

Version 2.2.3 2012-22-10 4

Version 2.2.3 2012-22-10 5
 (Nothing else compares..) I don't see any reason I would ever use another app or website to book a vacation spot. Simply awesome!

Version 2.2.3 2012-22-10 5
 (Amazing app! Useful way to book travel accommodations) Love it! Road less traveled spots

Version 2.2.3 2012-22-10 4

Version 2.2.2 2012-21-10 4
 (Great!!!) Wonderful job!!

Version 2.2.3 2012-21-10 4
 (Pretty darn good) An annoying bug: pricing doesn't always populate correctly when toggling. A feature I'd like to see: eliminating search results after I've ruled them out. Overall, well done UI & great service.

Version 2.2.0 2012-20-10 5
 (Best way to use airbnb!) The application is the most handiest when on the road...love the many features, especially the 'help! I need a place, tonight!'

Version 2.2.3 2012-19-10 4
 (Awesome!) App is great! Airbnb is awesome! I would like to be able to edit my pricing of my place and such though through the app.

Version 2.2.2 2012-18-10 3
 (Promising) I think its a great app, should cover more of the functionalities the website provides.

Version 2.2.2 2012-18-10 5
 (Beautiful Philadelphia room) I think this site was absolutely perfect for me! My stay at Juan's place in Philadelphia was a perfect location and was a great price for the time I stayed. It saved me $1000! The app works fine also!

Version 2.2.2 2012-18-10 2
 (Doesn't remember payment info) All of it needs to be entered every time for every reservation, which is a fairly big pain. Contacted customer support and was told there was no timetable to fix this problem.

Version 2.2.2 2012-18-10 5
 (Best Travel Deals!) It's saved me $1000's and has really allowed me to travel more frequently. I'm in love!

This literally is changing the way we view out future travel plans and has got us even more excited about seeing the world!! The app and website are simple, professional, and very user friendly!! So stoked about this site!!!

 (Fabulous site!) Love the flexibility and accessibility. Thinking of listing my own property too!!

Version 2.2.2 2012-10-10 3
 (Good service, adequate App) I find this app to have decent functionality, but I'm typically going to the site to do more involved tasks beyond checking in.  Also, would be nice if this actually fit a full iPad screen.

Version 2.2.2 2012-09-10 4
 (Love flipping thru the awesome properties) Well designed mobile app that definitely features photos very well. I wish All the features for Hosts were also available inside the mobile app. Overall it's an excellent tool to help me manage my awesomesauce Airbnb lifestyle. w00t! ;)

Version 2.2.2 2012-09-10 4

Version 2.2.2 2012-08-10 2
 (Great idea but buggy) It's fun to see what's available, but the app would freeze, then crash way too often.

Version 2.2.2 2012-08-10 5
 (I really love it.. cant believe it how cheap, i meant is this even real or a joke?? i) i love this one .. wow cant believe it how cheap the hotels,

Version 2.2.2 2012-07-10 5
 (Great idea.) Airbnb is a great idea, and the only thing holding it back is trust. If people had a little more trust it would be the most used app ever. I can't wait to get my extra room listed.

Version 2.2.2 2012-07-10 4
 (Nicely done) Nicely done

Version 2.2.2 2012-07-10 4
 (Love the service and now the app) Still you need to fix some bugs at times it crashes and I have to go to the laptop to interact with the host. Otherwise I like it

Version 2.2.2 2012-07-10 5
 (I love these guys) Serious, why stay at hotels, if you can now find awesome places around the world.

Version 2.2.2 2012-07-10 4
 (Good app) Solid

Version 2.2.2 2012-07-10 4
 (Great!!!) Wonderful job!!

Version 2.2.2 2012-07-10 2
 (Constant error messages) App worked first day.  I'll say navigation and layout are pretty good.  Second day though, can't create a user, can't login, can't research "current location". Every option gives an error message.  Big let down.

Version 2.2.2 2012-07-10 1
 (Terrible) I just got the app and am trying to use it and I've found that no matter how many times I force quit the app and or restart my phone, it continues to error out. Good thing it's free. It's worth every penny.

Version 2.2.2 2012-07-10 5
 (Love this app) It's so refreshing to have a different type of travel app out there!

Version 2.2.2 2012-06-10 5
 (I love them!) So easy to use. Thanks for this guys!

Version 2.2.2 2012-06-10 5
 (Like it, but...) I like this app but how do I verify whether it can be trusted or not?

Version 2.2.2 2012-06-10 5
 (Good app) Gateway to cool places! Great app

Version 2.2.2 2012-06-10 5
 (Stupendous!!) Wonderful app with helpful treats. Recommended for all adventurers & trip lovers.

Version 2.2.2 2012-06-10 5
 (Great!!) Awesome app. Beautifully designed as well.

Version 2.2.2 2012-06-10 1
 (App needs lots of work) I love Airbnb and have been a host for more than a year, but this app is very frustrating. No real calendar view. Logged out constantly. Intermittent notifications. No iPad app. At this point, I see no reason to use this app, and will continue to use the web app.

Version 2.2.2 2012-06-10 5
 (Beyond just a great app....) Not only is this a swell app but Airbnb is an all around great idea that is terrifically executed! Check out there website if you get a chance.

Version 2.2.2 2012-05-10 5
 (Avid traveler) I've been traveling abroad for years using services such as Hotwire, Expedia, and Hostelworld..... Never again now that I've found this! 

The service and hospitality that you receive by staying at a private home versus a hotel is unmatched. I've very much enjoyed getting to know both hosts we stayed with in Paris. One of which took a last minute reservation after we had missed our flight. 

Using the app is very simple. It was a snap to make a reservation from the airport wifi in CDG airport. 

The ONLY thing I would change about this app so far is to add a filter to place all the accommodations in order by price (least to most expensive etc)

Version 2.2.2 2012-05-10 5
 (Great app!) The Add to Passbook button is now showing up! Works great. The rest of the app is great. Made booking my upcoming trip out of the country a breeze.

Version 2.2.2 2012-05-10 5
 (Brilliant) This simple to use app is a great way to explore the world. I stayed over 7 places so far by using this app and there isn't a catch. The most troublesome I had was to decide what house or room or boat I should stay for the couple of days I went out of town or state. Why pay hotels if you can find a very comfortable house where you can call it home for a week or two? This app is simply, brilliant.

Version 2.2.2 2012-05-10 5
 (Great app) This will save me a lot when I travel.

Version 2.2.2 2012-04-10 3
 (iPad version) When do you finally release an iPad App for airbnb?!!!

Version 2.2.0 2012-04-10 5
 (Great ap) Love this app, easy to use. I only wish we can write reviews directly from ap

Version 2.2.1 2012-03-10 5
 (AirBnB) What a great way to connect people to local culture and activities! This is definitely the preferred way to see any city or destination! So go, enjoy what the world and AirBnB have to offer!!

Version 2.2.2 2012-03-10 3
 (Nice app, but Passbook not working) The app is very nice and seems to improve with each release. I was hoping I could add an existing reservation to Passbook, but the new integration is not working.

Version 2.2.1 2012-03-10 1
 (Passbook integration not working.) Just doesn't work with passbook.

Version 2.2.2 2012-03-10 5
 (Yay) Awesome

Version 2.2.1 2012-03-10 1
 (Passbook integration not working.) Simply doesn't show up in passbook.

Version 2.2.2 2012-02-10 5
 (📍🌎🌎🌎📍) I love this app. Even just looking at all the places to go keeps me busy. 🇯🇵🇰🇷🇩🇪🇨🇳🇺🇸🇫🇷🇪🇸🇮🇹🇷🇺🇬🇧

Version 2.2.2 2012-02-10 4
 (Passbook feature might have a bug) This is a great app, but with the addition of the passbook, there might just be a problem. I added a reservation that I have into the passbook, and it's got the wrong info. There appears to be sample text in the fields, and the location is showing in Australia, and California...

Version 2.2.1 2012-02-10 5
 (Great app) Easy to use, search and book!!!

Version 2.2.1 2012-02-10 5
 (Function & aesthetics) I have been a member since Aug 2012 and was frustrated when away from my desk using my iPhone 4, i was struggling to access the info I needed to host, respond to requests and messages. see people's profiles, etc. I downloaded the higher OS needed for the Airbnb app and now have the same functions the desktop offered. Excellent app and beautiful photos!

Version 2.2.1 2012-02-10 5
 (Airbnb Лучшее приложение из всех в своем ранге) Лучшие места представлены в списках, отдавайте предпочтения им!

Version 2.2.1 2012-02-10 5
 (Easy peasey) This app makes hosting and traveling a breeze.

Version 2.2.1 2012-02-10 5
 (well designed app) After searching on the computer website, I needed an app that could get me the same info (available properties, replies from owners, etc) while I was on the road. This app was easy to use, well-designed, and got me a great place to stay... all at my fingertips. keep it up!

Version 2.2.1 2012-01-10 5
 (Great first experience!) Found a wonderful modern condo near downtown for less than the cost of a hotel farther away! The app makes it very easy to book and manage reservations and keep in touch with the owners. We plan to rent out our extra room in our new home in Austin! This app will make it so easy! ;) thanks AirBnB!

Version 2.0.0 2012-29-09 5
 (Best App to monetize your space!!) I've been a member in the Airbnb community since June 2012 as a host. I've met many wonderful and exciting lives in the past 3 months. This app does what was impossible just a couple of years ago - it connects good people with space to good people looking for space. 

I will definitely use it during my upcoming travels!!

Thanks Airbnb team!

Version 2.2.1 2012-29-09 5
 (Great design, great functionality) What you'd hope for, what you'd expect

Version 2.2.1 2012-29-09 5
 (Great) Works good and the ease of use is prima!

Version 2.2.1 2012-27-09 5
 (Mr.) Amazing app. Very well done.

Version 2.2.1 2012-27-09 5
 (Great) Airbnb is great app ;)

Version 2.2.0 2012-26-09 5
 (Freedom in an app) Paired with the zipcar app, it turns the iPhone into an agent of freedom. Car and apt. in any city, at any time, on the spot. Technology, man.

Version 2.2.1 2012-24-09 3
 (Great App, but...) The message center (which is the only way to contact people) fails constantly. I either get error messages or the message appears to be sent, but then doesn't post to the conversation text board. 

When can we expect an iPad version? Love the iPhone app, would be thrilled to also have a version formatted for iPad.

Version 2.2.1 2012-24-09 5
 (Fantastic app!) Love this app! Haven't figured out how to leave a review from it yet, but I'm sure it's there. The call center for airbnb was very helpful and my rep worked with me to answer my questions. Love it!

Version 2.2.1 2012-24-09 5
 (First time user) My wife and I download airbnb just a few days before leaving on our trip. We booked an accommodation right away! The registration was simple. The searching for and the booking of rooms is user friendly and intuitive.  We can't recommend airbnb highly enough!

Version 2.2.1 2012-23-09 5
 (Super!) Highly recommend this app for anyone whom likes to travel and explore!

Version 2.2.1 2012-23-09 5
 (Even more functional than the website!) This little app lets you see even more than the airbnb site...so far, I've noticed additional location details and additional offer from a host that did not appear on the website.

Version 2.2.0 2012-23-09 5
 (Great app) All the features of the website conveniently in app form.

Version 2.2.1 2012-23-09 5
 (All about awesomeness!) AirBnb is all about awesomeness! Awesome idea into an awesome app. So easy to find the perfect place to stay, ranging from cheap to expensive, you'll find exactly what you want.

Version 2.2.1 2012-22-09 5
 (Well done) This app continues to improve and it is starting to show real refinement

Version 2.2.1 2012-22-09 5
 (Perfect!) I love AirBnb and this app is perfect for managing my bookings and guests.

Version 2.2.1 2012-20-09 5
 (Awesome & EZ to use!) Great site for the budget traveller although there are listings for those that prefer fancier digs too. Check them out!

Version 2.2.1 2012-20-09 5
 (Everybody wins !!!) It is a new way of traveling and not spending a lot of money on hotels and if you have a place to rent it is a great oportunity to do it.

Version 2.2.1 2012-20-09 5
 (Love air bnb) Love the service.  New to the app buy so far so good!!

Version 2.2.1 2012-20-09 5
 (Very good invention!) From your iPhone or iPad you can select your lodging for the next day! And pre-pay! You could get a luxurious B&B or a simple room in someone's condo in the middle of Montreal for cheap! Can't say too much about this.

Version 2.2.1 2012-19-09 5
 (Love this App.) Easy to use

Version 2.2.1 2012-19-09 1
 (Needs an update.) You cannot translate conversations on the app. It was very difficult to communicate with someone who spoke a different language. I had to keep going back to my computer.

Version 2.2.1 2012-19-09 5
 (Great app! Love it!) .

Version 2.2.1 2012-19-09 5
 (Exceptional!!!) I will be using this for my trip to Vegas for my bday in April! This app is so amazing and I have had it almost a year and is so accurate and such a great way to save money and experience travel the way it was meant to be experienced!!!
--G

Version 2.2.1 2012-19-09 5
 (I love this app!) I've been using airbnb for a year and everything was perfect, price, house and people. I highly recommend this app!!!

Version 2.2.1 2012-16-09 5
 (Grande) Ottima app anche per airbnb Italia

Version 2.2.1 2012-15-09 3
 (Good app but I need to see my calendar!!) I think that this is a good app and gets the job done. When you're not home you can still complete a reservation both as owner and guest.
However a big issue is for me (I'm a host) the fact that I cannot see my CALENDAR . 
It's very hard to accept or deny a reservation without the calendar in front of me. Please fix that!

Version 2.2.1 2012-15-09 4
 (Great work) Love the app for iPhone but where's the iPad version?

Version 2.2.1 2012-15-09 5
 (Awesome - But no iPad 3 app yet????) PLEASE IPAD WITH RETINA UPDATE!!!!!!

iPad this Shiz ASAP!

This would be perfect on the new iPad.  Please hurry and develop.

Version 2.2.1 2012-15-09 5
 (Love AirBnB Mobile App!) I love the AirBnB iPhone app! It helped me book rooms while I traveled Europe in 2010, and now that I'm settled back in the States it helps me manage my apartment booking requests on the go and keep my listing current! It's easy to use and very intuitive! Love it!

Version 2.2.0 2012-14-09 5
 (Convenient app) I was able to book a place to stay with this app while traveling.

Version 2.2.0 2012-14-09 4
 (Great Service, good app) I love airBnB!  As a host, this app is indispensable!!!  It makes answering emails and reservation requests SUPER easy.

My only complaint is, I cannot view a calendar with all my upcoming reservations for both my rentals on one page like is possible on the website.

Also, I can't figure out how to leave a review of someone from the app.

Overall, though, it has a beautiful interface and is a really important tool for a busy host like me!

Version 2.2.0 2012-13-09 4
 (Wowza) Great concept. App is easy to understand and use.  My only complaint is that the bnb price advertisements inaccurately display the lowest price and do not reflect total fees until check out.

Version 2.2.1 2012-13-09 4
 (Love the service) I love this service. But the photos take forever render when not connected to wifi.

Version 2.2.0 2012-13-09 5
 (Travel app) Best travel app ever!

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-09 4
 (Wonderful website with a great app.) Great app for the wonderful website! The wish list causes the app to close which is a bummer but everything else runs smoothly. Fix that glitch and it's definitely 5 star worthy. Will be using this on any trip that I take.

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-09 5
 (Mrs) Best service  and app will be using it for all my travel accommodation requirements

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-09 5
 (Lone this app) Wish I could ate my wish list, but otherwise awesome!

Version 2.2.0 2012-10-09 4
 (Greatest but) Love the app and concept... But wish lists crash the app

Version 2.2.0 2012-08-09 4
 (Works great!) Makes it easy to do nearly everything from your phone.

Version 2.2.0 2012-08-09 4
 (Very good but crashes on wish lists) Well organized and fast, but the app crashes every time you try to access or save to your wish lists

Version 2.2.0 2012-08-09 5
 (My first time.) So after a few months of worry about how my trips would play out using this service I am happy to report that I am more than pleased.  My first stop was to Susana's in Alfama Portugal. It was exactly as described and she was very kind and generous to us. Two bottles of  wine ( table and Port) that were wonderful iced tea and water. Oh yes and half a dozen fresh peaches! What a love. Next Barcelona with Tere. First of all she picked us up at the airport and her rental was perfect clean and very well decorated. Full of amenities and Wifi! I'm super happy that we used this valuable service!

Version 2.2.0 2012-08-09 5
 (Great App) One of the best app.

Version 2.2.0 2012-08-09 2
 (Keeps crashing wishlist) As said, this version keeps crashing on wishlist.

Version 2.2.0 2012-07-09 2
 (Crashes on wish list) It was great until recently. Not sure what's happening but it crashes everytime I click on my wish list. Also I got a message yesterday about some quota and I couldn't log in. Pls fix!

Version 2.2.0 2012-07-09 5
 (Love this app but love the program more!) I know I'm supposed to review the app which I think is wonderful but the whole idea of Air BnB is brilliant! I love it, it is the best thing for good people who love to travel. So much better than paying for a hotel. And you end up meeting interesting and kind people along the way. Worth the risk for a fantastic experience.

Version 2.2.0 2012-06-09 4
 (Very well done) From both a host and guest perspective......nearly flawless. But how about a landscape keyboard please..... Then it's a 5 star app.

Version 2.2.0 2012-06-09 5
 (AirBnB Love) This app is such a handy little tool for keeping track on my reservations and searches. I especially like that I can chat and call my prospective host directly from the app. The fact that it's integrated with Google Maps also makes it a wonderful travel tool.  I highly recommend it!

Version 2.2.0 2012-06-09 5
 (Super app) Does everything it needs to and works great.

Version 2.2.0 2012-06-09 5
 (Efficient app!) Thanks for making an efficient, user-friendly, easy-to-use app! I've found great and unique lodging. Although I do love the app, it's not as detailed as the website. A couple of suggestions for the mobile app:

- Ability to edit profile (besides just adding photos).

- A way to let customers see the total fees (the fee might increase depending how many people are staying) prior to pushing "Book it!" button.

Version 2.2.0 2012-06-09 5
 (Amazing) Best app ever!!!!p

Version 2.2.0 2012-05-09 4
 (Wonderful App. Just a few additions) Great inventory and amazing marketplace for the traveler, jet setter or otherwise. 

I'd add some features though:

1. Permanent filters so I don't have to set it after every search in a new location. 

2. CC profile for faster transactions (I haven't made a booking yet so I'm not 100% sure of the process, but the app GUI doesn't have a "wallet" feature for me to add a CC. 

3. Filter by needs to be sticky. Sometimes i want to search different areas in the same city. Or willing to stay in the town over (Brooklyn instead of NY,NY) the filters should memorize last previous filter by state.

Version 2.2.0 2012-05-09 5
 (Fantastic) Sooo happy to have found this app. Works well to communicate with the host. Happy traveling!

Version 2.2.0 2012-05-09 5
 (Happy to use this app!) Love airbnb!

Version 2.2.0 2012-05-09 5
 (Happy with app) I'm very happy with this app, well done & great job by the developers.

Version 2.2.0 2012-04-09 5
 (Airbnb es lo máximo) Tiene todo lo que puedes necesitar. Es tremenda, fácil uso, comunicación en todo el mundo y lo mejor que es gratis.

Version 2.2.0 2012-04-09 5
 (Fab) Easy, convenient, user friendly and fabulous. A must have for hosts and travelers!

Version 2.2.0 2012-03-09 5
 (sweetmaker) Love it and it will get better too!

Version 2.2.0 2012-03-09 5
 (Love it!) I've been looking for a source that aggregates affordable accommodations for international travel. This app is beautiful, smart and full of amazing apartment rentals.

Version 2.2.0 2012-03-09 5
 (...and they lived happily ever after) Don't know how I travelled without airbnb before getting to know them. Amazing

Version 2.2.0 2012-02-09 4
 (Cool) U guys r cool thnx for the best app. The only thing missing is prise from low to high

Version 2.2.0 2012-02-09 4
 (Love Love Love the app) Super convenient, accurate and I can find last minute availability anywhere I am. Which is perfect because I don't always know exactly where I'll end up. 

You made my visits through Cinque Terre affordable and lavish!

Version 2.2.0 2012-02-09 5
 (Amazin app) Help to travel anywhere

Version 2.2.0 2012-02-09 4
 (Turn off location settings when not in use) Love the app and love the concept. However, the app keeps my gps location settings on when the app is running in the background and not in use. I have to fully quit the app (double tapping Home button, press on minus sign on the app) in order for the purple gps arrow to disappear in the top right corner of my screen.

Version 2.2.0 2012-01-09 5
 (Excellent App) This app is incredible!

Version 2.2.0 2012-01-09 4
 (Love it) I love this app. Still waiting to be able to use it horizontally, but apart from that, I love it.

Version 2.2.0 2012-01-09 3
 (Need iPad version!!!!!!) Bring back the old icon!!!! please make iPad compatible!!!! So annoying that you can't use horizontal!!!!!!!!

Version 2.2.0 2012-01-09 5
 (Beautiful layout) Wonderful flow. This is a hip n' happenin' lil app.

Version 2.2.0 2012-30-08 5
 (Airbnb) I love this app, a friend of mine told me to try it and we did. We went to LA in may and I sent less for a weekend at a house then my friends did for a hotel LOL.....

Version 2.2.0 2012-30-08 4
 (Love the site) Have booked a week in New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Service has been excellent from both the host and AirBnB.

Version 2.2.0 2012-30-08 5
 (A world of adventure awaits!) Easy to use, fun app! I had no idea that places like this were available for a stay.

Version 1.4.2 2012-30-08 5
 (An eye for user experience goes a long way) The guys who built the air bnb app have done things right. Very responsive and with image preloading / caching the experience is great. Love to check up on my reservation via the app and search for properties to check back on later. 

Well done.

Version 2.2.0 2012-30-08 5
 (App and Site) Love the app, love the site!

Version 2.2.0 2012-29-08 2
 (Keeps signing me out...) It's really frustrating when I have to sign in EVERY time I use the app. On my iPhone and iPad. Also, there is so much information missing on the mobile app compared to the website, like additional costs for extra people so it looks like random fees are being added. Please fix this. 
Thank you!

Version 2.1.0 2012-29-08 5
 (Great app) Works great

Version 2.2.0 2012-28-08 5
 (Travel lodging at your finger) Love this app!  So easily accessible via your iPhone!

Version 2.2.0 2012-28-08 5
 (Airbnb) Love this site, love this app.  Real game changer for traveling.

Version 2.2.0 2012-28-08 5
 (Love it!!) Airbnb is such an amazing site, and the app is so easy to use, you can book a room right from your phone!  It is also great to have the maps and the hosts phone numbers easy to access.

Version 2.2.0 2012-28-08 1
 (App won't open) Every time I try to open the app the splash page comes on and then then app shuts down

Version 2.2.0 2012-28-08 1
 (App makes you loose money !!!) As a landlord DO NOT use this app. The app is missing the very important feature if pre-approving travelers, which are interested to book your place. Without pre-approving the travelers CAN NOT book your place and you loose the costumer and the booking and the money !!!

Version 2.1.0 2012-28-08 4
 (Very handy as host and guest) This app has made being both a host and a guest super convenient! I love it. I would give it the fifth star if there were the abillity to do reviews and access more account info preferences such as payment options etc and if it were a bit less buggy but I am very happy with Airbnb both as a guest and a host. It is a brilliant system!

Version 2.2.0 2012-28-08 1
 (Be careful where you stay) I've sadly burned my fingers one to many times now with AirBnB.

With our last visit to San Francisco, the place we stayed at reeked of cigarette smoke, the wall sockets were exposed, the beds and linen were substandard, there were an image of a naked lady in the bathroom which our host didn't want to remove despite us telling him it's bad for our kids. As soon as we arrived and saw the setup, we request to cancel our reservation with valid reasons and concerns, our host was horribly rude and blazé and said he will only refund 50% of our money. Airbnb - when we called them - was really not helpful, and they just said that it stated on the site it allows smoking - which we didnt see at all. We ended up losing so much money and staying in the Hilton. A proper hotel might have smoking rooms, but you won't have to inhale smoke in the public reception areas of the hotel. Yet it seems like airbnb is passive when it comes to smoking. I just realized I can get a 2 or 3 star hotel for the same price, yet with safe electric wall plugs, acceptable beds and linen, without smelling like smoke, and without a host being rude and belittling me and AirBnb folding their hands and saying I need to deal with tons of money I lost. Not again, thank you very very much.  Bunch of amateurs trying to play hotel-hotel at others cost.

Version 2.2.0 2012-26-08 4
 (Pretty cool) I like this app, easy to use, great being able to secure a room and everything. Like others, wish there was an iPad version, make an iPad version!

Version 2.2.0 2012-26-08 5
 (Great App) Great app to find a place to explore the world

Version 2.2.0 2012-25-08 5
 (Friends around the world) Air bnb is not only about rental it's about making new connections making new friends. I don't treat my guest as guests I treat them as friends and they treat me the same way. Thanks air bnb for allowing me to make friends all over the world.

Version 2.2.0 2012-25-08 5
 (Solid app, works great!) This app is truly a joy to use! Great UX and functionality.

Version 2.2.0 2012-24-08 5

 (So useful!) I love this site and the app is so helpful!!!  I am now ready for my trip!

Version 2.2.0 2012-23-08 5
 (Excelent) Well designed, easy to use.

Version 2.2.0 2012-23-08 4
 (Useful) I'm impressed by the design of this app. Just wish there were an iPad version.

Version 2.2.0 2012-23-08 5
 (Great App) Like most apps, this does not have all the functionality of the full website but it  is well laid out, easy to use, and makes it possible to manage reservations and contact guests remotely which is critical to managing our cottage.

Version 2.2.0 2012-22-08 5
 (Airbnb) Open the world of travel n lodging in ways n spaces you never would find while expanding new relationships. Fabulous resource!

Version 2.1.0 2012-22-08 5
 (Very convenient) Love the convenience, the pictures and user interface is great. It's simple to use, yet has enough functionality to do what you need. I haven't tried wish lists, etc. But for responding and communicating with guests, it's great.

Version 2.2.0 2012-22-08 5
 (Great app) Very easy to use. Fantastic app.

Version 2.2.0 2012-21-08 4
 (Хорошая программа) Замечательный сервис, хорошая программа. Только не пойму как сделать подтверждение телефона.

 (Useful but buggy) I found this app after the website and I have to say that both are a bit buggy. The app can't seem to load my wish lists, so I can't check what I found through the website.  I hope this is fixed soon.

Version 2.2.0 2012-20-08 5
 (Amazing) Simple. Powerful. Easy. And it looks great. One of my new favorite apps!

Version 2.2.0 2012-20-08 5
 (Just what the doc ordered.) This app is perfect for those who have to take call at hospitals that are too far a distance from their homes.

Version 2.2.0 2012-20-08 5
 (Great app) Very enjoyable to use.

Version 2.1.0 2012-19-08 5
 (Easy to work) Awesome. Easy to work. Wish we could write reviews on app.

Version 2.0.0 2012-19-08 1
 (Calendar) How can you have a calendar based app with no calendar??

Version 2.2.0 2012-19-08 5
 (Big fan : ]) My best friend and I have stayed at two different places within the past two nights and we had amazing success! The places were great and it makes you feel at home even when you're on vacation! I will go here over hotels in the future... Thanks airbnb!

Version 2.2.0 2012-18-08 5
 (Great app) Super easy to use

Version 2.2.0 2012-18-08 3
 (AIRBNB is AMAZING the app not as good as desktop) AIRBNB is AMAZING the app not as good as desktop

Version 2.1.0 2012-18-08 5
 (Simply amazing) This is so much more cooler than HotelsTonight AND you get to meet fun locals. It's a win win

Version 2.2.0 2012-17-08 5
 (Great Design) My one quibble is that I generally want to handle my reservations on mobile, not search for new reservations. But I'm only one data point. And I still think the app is beautiful.

Version 2.2.0 2012-16-08 4
 (Pretty solid app) From time to time the app crashes, but usually works great. 

The concept is a brilliant one and the app is super easy to use.

Version 2.2.0 2012-16-08 3
 (No iPad version?) I love airbnb, and this app isn't bad, but come on... No iPad version?

Anytime now...

Version 2.2.0 2012-16-08 1
 (Crashes when you need it most...) ...for me, it's when I try to access saved reservations on the road. Just upgraded to a 4S and with no other apps running, always crashes within 5 clicks. Better to use via mobile browser.

Version 2.2.0 2012-16-08 5
 (Love love love) Great app! Love the functionality, love the site and love the AirBnB organization as a whole. This resolute has made our European vacation a success. We love staying with hosts rather than a hotel because you get closer to the culture and AirBnB makes it possible. Thanks!

Version 2.2.0 2012-16-08 5
 (Awsome) Great App 
I just loved it, great costumer service as well!
As soon as I put my place in I had reservations,
 Thanks airbnb!!!

Version 2.1.0 2012-16-08 4
 (Great app!) Great app...soo much better than the mobile website.

Version 2.2.0 2012-16-08 1
 (Had three places reject reservations) I have had three places reject reservations even though they were listed as available.  Do not waste your time as the rental owners apparently bait and switch pricing.   :(

Version 2.2.0 2012-15-08 5
 (Spot on) This app and service is spot on. I'm enjoying traveling again. Bye, bye holiday inn. Hello Airbnb.

Version 2.2.0 2012-15-08 5
 (People are incompetent) I love this app and air BnB in general, I've also NEVER have had a major problem with the app crashing, NEVER! My guess for the swarms of people who have problems either 1.) Have too many open apps 2.) Have too much 💩 on their device in general 3.) Are impatient... Yes the app has crashed occasionally, but mainly because my old 3GS is barely hanging in there and this app requires a fair amount of memory to run it. I can't stand people who give apps 1 star for apps crashing, 95% of the time it's human error on their part.

All and all it's a solid app, I do wish they would rethinking the nice flashy intro and fancier graphics to alleviate some of performance issues that people clearly do not have the ability to express without sounding like child having a temper tantrum. Remember kiddies, that annoying feeling you get when you try running the app isn't the apps fault, it's your subconscious suddenly realizing that you are in fact an idiot. 😃😘

Version 2.2.0 2012-15-08 5
 (Sweet) Haven't actually booked anything yet but I'm anxious to. Good app.

Version 2.2.0 2012-15-08 5
 (Solid product) All around bodacious, applicious software. Web and mobile. 👌

Version 2.2.0 2012-15-08 5
 (Awesome) Wow! What a way to travel!

Version 2.2.0 2012-15-08 2
 (Where's the iPad App?) The iPad has been out for several years now. Where's the iPad app? Please create an iPad version of Airbnb. I use this app when I travel overseas every year.

Version 2.2.0 2012-14-08 4
 (Great intuitive App) I love the app, it is do easy to navigate and make reservations on the fly. My number one companion for booking a place.

Version 2.2.0 2012-14-08 4
 (Say "YES!" to Airbnb!!!) The  app is very user-friendly. The Airbnb concept is, hands-down, ingenious! My only complaint is that I can't get to my dashboard on my iPhone. I have to log on to my laptop to write reviews...very inconvenient!

Version 2.2.0 2012-14-08 4
 (Great traveling app) This is an app that gives alot of opportunity to travel and see any great city!

I am having a hard time loafing everything I want on to my profile but it just takes sometime to get things going!

Version 2.2.0 2012-14-08 5
 (It is so nice!) The idea is perfect! Will always use this!

Version 2.2.0 2012-14-08 3
 (Wish list for this app?) Seems like the crashes are reduced, now can we get more functions that are available on the full site?

Version 2.1.0 2012-13-08 5
 (Airbnb hosting) I love airbnb.. So much I wouldn't mind working them. The application is simple to use, I have hosted people from all over the world and made new friends. The company listens to suggestions, continually refining the customer and host experience. I spread the word wherever I go.....  Airbnb is good for you and me!

Version 2.2.0 2012-13-08 5
 (Thanks AirBNB) What a beautiful idea! I'm so glad to be able to experience this journey.

Version 2.2.0 2012-13-08 4
 (Good app) Misses the opportunity of giving an alternate option to the guest. Overall its ok for host. 
Much better app for guests.

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (Not amused) App doesn't work. Opens for two seconds then quits. App deleted. Willnp longer use your stupid service. Am now using an alternative provider.

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (Crash) Must fix this issue! Can't even browse!!

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (Nothing but Crashes) I'd like to use this app but it crashes every time

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (Crashes constantly) Not sure if anyone else is having problems with this app, but it won't get past the start screen before it crashes! Too bad! I will rate it higher if I can get it to stop crashing.

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (Great Crashes!) This is terrible & embarrassing!

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (App keeps crashing) Hey the app keeps crashing each time I open it.

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (Crashes on opening) I installed it, signed in, and now it crashes as soon as it's opened. I have no idea if it's theoretically a good program because that's as far as I can get. The site isn't particularly mobile-friendly, so I was hoping this app might be less annoying.

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 5
 (Please fix!!! It's crashing!!!) Please fix it!! I go on this app everyday. I depend on it for my rental business. 
It keeps crashing when I open it since two days ago. I have tried reinstalling the app but it still doesn't work. I love this app so much. 
*What it does need is a way to see the availability calendar on rental properties.
* a way to sort the list of property finds by lowest price first.. Or highest price first... Or distance... And so forth.
*and the "see more" options for filtering on type of rental you are looking for. example " boat, tree house, villa..."
Thanx!

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 5
 (Great.) Easy to use. Great app. But recently it has started to crash a lot. May be a bug that needs attention. Overall really great and easy to use. It makes it easy to follow your hosts once you make the reservation.

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (Crash) This app has been crashing on startup ever since I downloaded it a year ago! I have been updating it and my phone and still the same issue. Please fix! Thanks!!!!

 (Crashes) Crashes as soon as you tap "let me browse". Love airbnb... please fix so I can give you guys a 5 star rating. ;)

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (Worked once....) Was able to get this app to work once on my iPad and iPhone. Thereafter, it would quit after launch on both devices - even after a reinstall. 

It looked promising when I was able to get it to work, but there's no,way I'd trust a vacation to it in its current state. Fix the bugs and I'll be all over it.

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (Needs Fix Fast) Seemed like a must have App based on its description so I downloaded it but it keeps crashing after the launch screen. Fix please.

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (It stinks!) Just downloaded this app and all it does is crash. SUCKO.

Version 2.2.0 2012-12-08 1

 (👎👎👎👎) Crashes every time I try to browse. Deleted.

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 4
 (Eh) It's been crashing multiple times in a row when just opening the app. Other than that, it's pretty helpful.

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 1
 (Can't browse, crashes) I thought this would be an interesting app to use traveling.  It's nearly impossible to use browse, however, because it nearly always crashes.  I will leave it installed for a while to be alerted for an update which it badly needs but if one is not here soon, will have to delete the app.

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 1
 (Crash and burn) Did anyone perform basic QA on this app before the release?  As soon as I attempted to login using Facebook, the app crashed. Every time I try to open the app it crashes.

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 4
 (Great app but CRASHING!!!) The app is fine and nice and basically works but since the update it only crashes before I can do anything. I tried restarting my iPhone, deleting and reinstalling the app, and it doesn't help. Also, before this update it was fine except if I was looking at pictures for too long it would crash. Please fix!!

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 1
 (Grrrr!) Was great......now crashing on opening!

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 3
 (3 Young Guys) Airbnb's founders are multimillionaires and a few years older than me. Nice job guys! (although I think they took too much VC money and don't have much control) Anyways very beautiful app but it crashed the first time I clicked on "browse" and started scrolling down through listings in the San Jose area. I'd expect Priceline and competitors to start competing soon but it's a cool idea.

Try to iron out those bugs guys!

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 1
 (Doesn't work) Everytime I select "let me browse", the app crashes.

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 1
 (Looks good but crashes) Won't open and crashes when I tap search button

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 4
 (Great app but crash sometimes) Same as the title

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 1
 (Crashing after clicking browse (100%) occurrence) Iphone 4 running ios 5.1.1 after the launch animation as soon after I click browse the app attempts to load new view and crashes.

Restarted phone same issue, re-downloaded app, same issue.

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 4
 (Great app but...) Great app but still needs a bit of tweaking. Crashes when "popular" tab is clicked

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 4
 (Crashing on iPad) Love the app on my iPhone so a good rating, but crashes on IPad 2 when I click Browse on the start screen 100% of the time.

Version 2.2.0 2012-11-08 5
 (Live on the Go!) Quite useful

Version 2.2.0 2012-10-08 5

Version 2.2.0 2012-10-08 5
 (Excellent app) I really like this app

Version 2.2.0 2012-09-08 4
 (Very user-friendly...) But I wish it offered a "sort" feature, like by price or ratings, once you've filtered your search. Other than that, excellent app—I'm using it in France now!

Version 2.2.0 2012-09-08 4
 (Very useful) Such a useful, easy app. Great work!

Version 2.1.0 2012-07-08 5
 (The new way to travel) My wife and I just used airbnb in Europe and we had a great time meeting the hosts through out the trip... We felt very safe and worry free

Version 2.2.0 2012-07-08 5
 (Good idea) Very good idea to make book a staying place

Version 2.1.0 2012-07-08 5
 (Airbnb) Best b&b source with photos of the people offering their space to you. No surprises here. Thorough,...I found two locations to stay, both were fabulous. I'm extremely discriminating with where I sleep...who isn't. ;)

Version 2.1.0 2012-07-08 5
 (Love the website and the app) Thanks airbnb

Version 2.1.0 2012-07-08 5
 (AIRBNB) I love this site. When I travel I want to experience the location not as a tourist that only sees other tourist. It is great to find homes and residents that I can relax and enjoy.

Version 2.2.0 2012-06-08 5
 (Perfeito!) Muito útil, funciona muito bem!

Version 2.2.0 2012-06-08 5
 (Accessible App) This app is very easy to use.

Version 2.2.0 2012-06-08 5
 (Better than the full site!) This app has so many useful features, I'm a avid homeaway and vrbo renter (haven't stayed in a hotel in years) but their app is a disgrace! I am always on the go and with communication with the owners via airbnb app (which also sends me a text to let me know I received a response to an inquiry or reservation) it's by far superior! Also the filtering and map search option are EXTREMELY useful to allow you to find something in the neighborhood even the exact street/block you want to be in. I'll never use another vacation rental site other than Airbnb!!!! 

Only recommendation is to contact owners periodically to review and confirm their listing and calendar are up to date to their current preferences.

Version 2.1.0 2012-05-08 5
 (I'll Never go back to Hotels Again!) I'll Never go back to Hotels Again! Love the home like feel on vacation.

Version 2.1.0 2012-04-08 4
 (Wow) Love this app this whole concept... Thank you!

Version 2.2.0 2012-04-08 5
 (Great app.) Beautiful and inspiring locations. I love the app but HATE the new icon. And I can't help but notice that there has been yet another update but the horrible icon is still there. Please bring back the luggage. There's nothing less original than having just a letter as an entire icon.

Version 2.1.0 2012-03-08 5
 (Great app) This works great. It opens up so many unique and favorable options every time I want to go somewhere. 
And the customer service has been fast and extremely helpful.

Version 2.1.0 2012-03-08 5
 (Best Airbnb app evet) Even easier to book here than book via hotels

Version 2.1.0 2012-28-07 3
 (Helpful, but with problems) When I click to see recent message it won't display new message. Mostly a blank screen. Sometimes I can see old messages but not the new ones.

 (The best app I ever downloaded) I love this app, the site, and everything about it! No more expensive hotels 100%. Love the places I've been too not a complaint! Just amazing!

 (Great app, great website!) So sick. Done booking expensive hotels .

 (Upload photos from device is missing!) When taking photos of my place I want to be able to upload photos from device. Frustrating that I have to take each picture at a time rather than just taking a whole bunch and just selecting the one or two that are great. Please make me happy and add it.  Thank you.

Version 2.1.0 2012-24-07 5
 (Pretty good) The app is great except I can't rate properties unless I sign in online, not using the app.  Maybe I just haven't figured it out yet.....

Version 2.1.0 2012-24-07 5
 (Simply easy and loving it) First of all, best idea ever! Who needs over priced hotels when you have a whole condo/house/apartment in the best locations!!! I'm in love with this app

Version 2.1.0 2012-23-07 4
 (Amazing service, app still limited) Airbnb is a great service, but I'm hoping they'll eventually bring parity to the app and website. The app doesn't allow hosts to Pre-approve reservations so I always have to sign onto the full website to do this.

Version 2.1.0 2012-23-07 2
 (Good Idea.  But....) The Service is great if there are no major issues.  But if you have a issue BEWARE!! Airbnb customer service is HORRIBLE, I mean just AWEFUL.  If you have problems don't expect customer support to come to the rescue.  Really, Airbnb CS should be ashamed of themselves.

Version 2.1.0 2012-23-07 5
 (Great resource) We have met some great folks. A wonderful way to travel.

 (Could have been much better) The problem with this app is that it's missing a lot of features on the full website I only use it for communication with the host and not leaving reviews or searching for places.

Version 2.1.0 2012-21-07 5
 (Awesome) Great!

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-07 3
 (Fix the crashes and we're shiny!) Great concept and easy to use but it constantly crashes on me.

Version 2.1.0 2012-21-07 1
 (Broken Search) App does not filter any results. It displays all 200,000 plus results whatever the search. Plus no way to delete your search history.

Version 2.1.0 2012-21-07 3
 (Decent) Needs some work, search results do not show.

Version 2.1.0 2012-21-07 5
 (Great) If you're looking for a place to stay and meet some cool people this is it

Version 2.1.0 2012-21-07 1
 (Faulty app) I like airbnb but this app needs some work.   No matter what I type in to search, the search results are always the same.  Only way to browse what's available in the area you are interested is to go to the map and click on each pin.   I rather wait until I am in front of a computer than using this app if I want to search.

Version 2.1.0 2012-20-07 5
 (Amazing!) What a fabulous app! I've stayed at B&B's for years, this is a nice little way to put lots of them all in one place and it does a lot of the handy work for you.. Some of the houses are breathtaking too. I highly recommend it

Version 2.1.0 2012-20-07 5
 (Love) I think I've found my favorite iPhone app by far. It's absolutely magnificent, more addicting than any game!!! I can spend HOURS browsing through these adorable apartments!!!

 (mr vacationer) First time using this site
It was a big help for me 
I love it

Version 2.0.0 2012-18-07 1
 (Horrible for Hosting) I love airbnb, hate their app. Maybe for travelers it's good but for hosts its completely useless. You can't view the calendar of your listings and future reservations, you can't pre-approve guests if they make an inquiry, you can't edit your listings, etc etc. What a joke. Airbnb does such a wonderful job on their website to make it super easy to list your place, which is why it's mind-boggling that the app is so limited.

Version 2.1.0 2012-17-07 5
 (Love it) I've been to many cities and via Airbnb, stayed with the locals who gave me very Comfortable accommodation.

Version 2.1.0 2012-17-07 5
 (Amazing! Love this!!!) This is a great app. The first thing I go to when making travel arrangements!

Version 2.1.0 2012-17-07 4
 (Needs an iPad version) The iPhone version just doesn't cut it on the iPad retina display.

Version 2.1.0 2012-16-07 5
 (Simply amazing) I know have a reason to travel

Version 2.1.0 2012-16-07 5
 (Love it) Love it. The best thing.

Version 2.1.0 2012-15-07 5
 (Great app for a great site) Easy to use, intuitive and fun to peak at all beautiful apartments all over the world. Looking forward to an IPad app soon I hope!

Version 2.1.0 2012-15-07 5
 (Airbnb) The site is fantastic! The customer service is very friendly and will spend as much time needed on the phone with you. The site makes it very easy to find a home anywhere you are traveling to. I think they thought of everything needed if you plan or vacationing or you have a rental you would like to advertise.  It is truly a wonderful and easy site! This is a must for anyone that travels or has a vacation rental.

Version 2.1.0 2012-15-07 5
 (Love it!) Great app! Easy to use and fun!

Version 2.0.0 2012-15-07 5
 (Love it!!) I just got Into Airbnb and I love that there is an app. It keeps me notified on all activity on my acct. I just wish it was available on blackberry playbooks. Otherwise, great app!!!!

Version 2.1.0 2012-15-07 5
 (My favorite app) So much fun to browse even if you're not going anywhere!!!

Version 2.1.0 2012-14-07 5
 (Make one for the iPad please!) Excellent iPhone app! I have a booking for our vacation in Sept & I'm able to communicate with the host & see photos of the apartment we rented. Please make an iPad version please!

Version 2.1.0 2012-13-07 5
 (Very slick) Really slick interface. Wish there was a way to control text notifications.

Version 2.1.0 2012-13-07 5
 (Love the pictures!) Great app.

Version 2.0.0 2012-12-07 5
 (awesome handy helper!) booked all our accommodations through airbnb, mostly from my iphone - 7 european cities in august 2012! love the ease and portability of the app. i could browse, view my favorites, communicate w owners, and book all while i'm out doing errands. wouldn't have gotten it done this quickly and easily without airbnb app.

Version 2.0.0 2012-11-07 5
 (Great app, great deals!!!!) If you travel this app it's a MUST!!!

Version 2.1.0 2012-11-07 4
 (Nice app.) I Love Airbnb!

Version 2.1.0 2012-11-07 1
 (I used to love it but the design is ugly) Please bring the old look back!! This looks generic now

Version 2.1.0 2012-11-07 3
 (Cuts sound off) Would like to browse while listening to music or podcasts but when I access the app it cuts the sound off. Don't know why this app co-ops the sound.

Version 2.0.0 2012-11-07 4
 (Great website & App!) This is a really cool website !

Version 2.1.0 2012-10-07 4
 (Almost but not yet...) The is getting better with updates.  As of late my only complaint is that you are unable to see reviews once you are emailed.  Otherwise keep going guys.  Great stuff!

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-07 2
 (Crash...!!!! Crash and more Crash!!!!) Everytime i try to search for a place it crashes. Then i hav to do my search again which is extreamly annoying

Version 2.1.0 2012-10-07 3
 (Almost there, but not quite) I only just joined AirBnB last week, and have already made over $400 renting to a few really nice folks disparate to find a place to stay in my area. The app works great notifying me about things happening on my profile, but lacks a few major functions.

I know there's not a huge user base for this, but where's the iPad app? That's one star for me. The other is I can't upload photos from my iPhone/iPad. Sure I can take a photo, but I'm a photographer hobbiest with a really expensive camera that I somtimes use my iPad to do editing on. It came as a total shock when I found all I could do was "snap" a photo, but not choose one from my library. Seems like a basic thing, and thus, another star bites the dust.

Bring an iPad version and uploading from the library along with maybe some minor interface addons, and I will be happy to give 5 stars. Great great great concept though business wise!!

Version 2.1.0 2012-09-07 5
 (Amazing concept - nice app too!!) Amazing concept - nice app too!!

Version 2.0.0 2012-09-07 5
 (good app) good app

Version 2.0.0 2012-08-07 5
 (Great app!!) This is an awesome app for a terrific service!

Version 2.0.0 2012-07-07 1
 (Fantastic service but app is regressing) I stayed at two Airbnb-listed properties in Manhattan earlier this year -- fantastic experiences.  

The Airbnb app, sadly, is going backwards.  The app has gotten clumsier and buggier with every iteration.  For example, the "Collections" subsection under the Featured option has four major choices at the top of the screen.  Clicking on any of them yields, "Error, Unfortunately, this resource is no longer available."

You can't use the app to search easily -- the search option simply gives you the ability to enter a city.  If you're looking for a specific set of keywords, or are looking for a specific named property, you're out of luck.  

The seems to be no integration between their website and the app.  For example, the Airbnb website allows you to flag a property for your "Wish List."  The app allows you to see "Your Favorites" under the "Account" option, but "Favorites" seem to be unrelated to "Wish Lists."

Sad -- the Airbnb service has such promise, but the app is clearly not getting sufficient resources for design or testing.  Hope that they can pull this one out of the fire soon.

Version 2.0.0 2012-07-07 1
 (Terrible App! They steal your deposit!!!) I thought this app was good until I used it! I am a traveler and book through all kinds of websites. I thought it would be nice to have an app that booked exotic locations and rentals. DO NOT USE THIS APP! The company has terrible protocol and I was taken by them for my deposit. Never using it again. Trashed! Good bye and good luck with ripping off your customers.

Version 2.1.0 2012-06-07 5
 (Great app) I can pull up all my reservation info quickly and book quickly.

Version 2.1.0 2012-05-07 5
 (Awesome app) Great for finding last-minute places to stay!

Version 2.1.0 2012-05-07 5
 (Excellent app.) I can manage my properties anywhere I am, that's great. But the version has bugs. Many times when I get a new msg I try to open it and it appears empty.

Version 2.1.0 2012-04-07 3
 (Needs more filtering ability) The app is ok, stable not crashy, & handy, but it's limited. I can search by location & dates & broad categories - private rm, shared, # bedrooms & bath, but that's pretty much it. I'm traveling with a dog so wish I could limit by pet friendly the way you can on the website. I also want to review via the app but don't seem to be able to do that.

Version 2.1.0 2012-04-07 3
 (Pink price tag and collections are GONE!) I love the iconic pink price tag? Why has it been axed? It was eye catching in the WWDC Thank You video and sorely missing now. 
Also the new tumblr/twitter-like wish lists are ok, but the curated lists of tree houses, glamping, etc. part of this app are missing. Why can't it just a user option to show one or the other? Seeing those collections makes it easier to show off the service to those people I share airbnb with. 

Other than these new changes, airbnb is fantastic.

Version 2.0.0 2012-04-07 5
 (Top notch) App is very useful to get back to potential guests timely. Functional, nice looking and user friendly. Only thing I'd change is the home page full of illustrative images that aren't purposeful an cause the app to load slowly. Images are beautiful but unnecessary in that home page. The trade off isn't worth the time it takes to load. App is very functional and super useful. Very thankful for it!

Version 2.0.0 2012-03-07 5
 (Well done) Nice application

Version 2.0.0 2012-03-07 5
 (Awesome for my travels!) The airbnb app looks great and was super valuable for my travels in Europe. Thanks AirBnB!

Version 2.0.0 2012-02-07 2
 (Great idea, but app is broken) Two major issues: 
1) Constant connection problems (must be the Airbnb server)
2) Browsing the map for properties is
completely broken and useless. Message like "Zoom to see 300 properties". No matter if you zoom in or out, nothing is displayed. Sometimes,
zooming out *reduces* the number of properties drastically, which doesn't make any sense.

Version 2.0.0 2012-02-07 3
 (My Messages Dissapear) Sometimes when I get a new message it will not load an only appears blank. This is really frustrating.... Please fix and I will give a 5 star review.

Version 2.0.0 2012-02-07 4
 (Pretty Good) First time using the service.  App was put together well without being too flashy.

Version 2.0.0 2012-01-07 5
 (Already booked our vacation) Downloaded this app yesterday afternoon and already have a condo for next June in fl for a FRACTION  of the on site Disney prices!!!!!!! LOVE it!  owner had good references and got right back to us!!!

Version 2.0.0 2012-01-07 5
 (Better than the website) The app is doing all the right things. Simple to navigate, fast, clear. Thanks for all you do!

Version 2.0.0 2012-01-07 4
 (DREAMING!) What a great way to dream big and yet plan realistically.

Version 2.0.0 2012-01-07 2
 (Great App but no currency settings) I would give the app 5 stars if it shows what currency is used to calculate prices, and also the app should allow to change currency settings.

Version 2.0.0 2012-01-07 5
 (Travelers unite!) I've used AirBnB multiple times and I'm still surprised at the convenience of it; location, prices, and overall variety of places to stay at. It's a simple app that has all you need, if you're planning a trip ahead or spontaneously took a road trip tonight, this is better than hotels guaranteed. You get the comforts of a home + amenities of privacy of a hotel. It's nothing but win here.

Version 2.0.0 2012-01-07 4
 (Airbnb amazing, but app is limiting) Airbnb is an amazing concept and works perfectly well for both travelers and hosts! Kudos to the smart guys who started the idea and developed it to this extend. 
The iphone app however, is a bit limiting and needs more work. Overall it works fine for the options available on the app, but I always find myself opening the full website on my phone.

Version 2.0.0 2012-01-07 4
 (Good) Really useful and helpful app and service

Version 2.0.0 2012-30-06 5
 (Travel the world with a full bank account) My first month I posted my home for rent, I earned a quick $5307 which I then used to pay for a round trip airfare to take my girlfriend in Brasil for a three week all expense paid vacation - what a great invention airbnb is...! How come no one thought if this sooner !?!

Version 2.0.0 2012-30-06 5
 (Superb app!) Would love to travel globe with Airbnb 1 day!
Great service, fantastic app!

Version 2.0.0 2012-30-06 5

Very impressed with the places I could use

 (Ótimo aplicativo) Excelente aplicativo tanto pra quem anuncia, quanto pra quem procura!!

Version 2.0.0 2012-28-06 5
 (Brilliant!) My husband and I needed a cheap room in Northern California, and I refused to stay at a Motel 6. I suggested we try Airbnb and am so glad I did! We found an adorable back house to rent for less cash than we were going to pay for a rundown motel room. The ap works great and the site is amazing. 5 stars all the way around. Thank you, Airbnb!

Version 1.4.2 2012-28-06 5
 (Helpful App) Love to be responsive to our potential guests, and this app makes it easy.

Version 2.0.0 2012-27-06 4
 (Why no ipad?) Make the app universal and its going to be automatic 5 stars

Version 1.3.0 2012-27-06 5
 (Great app!) Only problem is you can't upload pictures from your phone. You have to do it from a computer. I find it easy to email and search on the app. Overall, great app!

 (Airbnb has helped us a lot ! Great idea.) Airbnb has helped us a lot ! Great idea.

Version 2.0.0 2012-26-06 5
 (No other app like this one) From the UI to the whole experience, Airbnb has got to be a 'must' for family vacations, honeymooners or just backpackers. LOVE IT!

Version 2.0.0 2012-25-06 5
 (Very nice interface. Fast and stable.) Browsing, booking, and messaging are all very easy with the app.  Very nice UI too.

Version 2.0.0 2012-24-06 5
 (Amazing app) I booked an entire trip, switching locations every day, using this app. So easy and helpful!

 (Must have application) Love it
Thanks

Version 2.0.0 2012-24-06 5
 (This app is awesome!!) This makes browsing properties so easy I have lots of favorites now .....

Version 2.0.0 2012-23-06 5
 (Fabulous concept!!!) I love this site. What an easy and convenient way to book a room. And at prices significantly cheaper than a hotel!

Version 2.0.0 2012-22-06 5
 (Fantastic source of last minute help) Airbnb is a great community-based resource, and a well established way to connect to people from such beautiful and diverse backgrounds from a myriad of spots. I have been using this app to plan my trip for the past 3 weeks, some at the last minute and others with advance planning. Will continue to rely on this site as a way to enhance my travels!

Version 2.0.0 2012-22-06 3
 (Airbnb vs its app) I love love but the app has to improve, I.e. I can't see my price settings and I can't make setting changes.

Version 2.0.0 2012-22-06 3
 (Simple, but no share options) I like the clean, easy navigation. However, if you want to share a property listing with friends or your spouse, you can't do it from the app. Pretty critical oversight.

Version 2.0.0 2012-22-06 5
 (Best way to see a new or familiar place) I love that I get to hand select exactly where I sleep, from the neighborhood, to the decor, to the local I stay with. Enjoy the fact that it's all available at my finger tips on my phone.

Version 1.4.2 2012-21-06 5
 (Great app) I love the interface and the usability of this app. The search function is easy to navigate and intuitive and the videos and extra content is well made. A great, useful app.

Version 2.0.0 2012-21-06 3
 (A lot to work on) Still have bags. As a photographer of Airbnb is too hard for me to work with this app. It makes messages disappear as I get a new one or send a reply. It doubles the messages but shows nothing in it. 
Please fix it. 
Thank you

Version 1.3.0 2012-20-06 2
 (Always crashing) I love this app, but it always crashes when I use it. If that didn't happen then it would definitely get 5 stars.

Version 2.0.0 2012-20-06 5

 (Planning family trips just got better!) I love planning vacations for the family on my own! I am always looking for a small or just quick place to stay because we only really use the area for such a short time it's not worth it to pay so much- love how this works! Hope the friendly people that are on the site stay for as long as they can! Great job!

Version 2.0.0 2012-19-06 5
 (Cool) Need iPad app too!
Thanks,

Version 2.0.0 2012-19-06 5
 (Love it) I am only using this app for 2 days and I loooovvveee it! I'll keep usin' it! Great!

Version 2.0.0 2012-19-06 4
 (NancyinAZ) I think I'll be able to use this app for an upcoming trip; I see allot of options at my destination. I've rated it based on the information made available and the # of pictures being provided.  The pictures really help..the more the better.

It would be nice if users could search by City or state, then narrow the search to the # of bedrooms, or whether pets were allowed, house, apartment, etc.

Version 2.0.0 2012-18-06 5
 (Love) Love this app. We use it as hosts and guests and find it easy to use and pretty robust for an app.

Version 1.4.2 2012-18-06 5
 (illmatic) it's a new world

Version 2.0.0 2012-17-06 5
 (best renting app) make one for iPad too???

Version 2.0.0 2012-17-06 5
 (Add Calendar!) Please add a calendar feature to the app! As a host this app is extremely limiting without access to property bookings, the ability to change a nights price, etc. 

On the plus side... the layout is beautiful, the ability to upload photos is great, and Airbnb rocks!!!

Version 2.0.0 2012-17-06 5
 (Great app!) Love the site, and this is a perfect app to go with it.  The app makes it very simple to see all of the details and contact info of upcoming stays, as well as a great interface for finding new places. Haven't used it yet for hosting, so I'll update the review once I do!

Version 2.0.0 2012-17-06 5

 (Lot's of issues with this app -CRASHES) This app has a lot of issues and it constantly crashes. Even if you close the app lately and restart it, doesn't seem to the trick.

Version 2.0.0 2012-15-06 5
 (Love it so far!) Set up an account and began planning right away!

Just wish it let you set up your own place for renting.

Version 2.0.0 2012-14-06 2
 (Was a decent app) It crashed a lot, but it was tolerable. However with the last two updates it doesn't work at all. Not helpful when one is traveling and needs access. Please fix this buggy and unstable app.

Version 2.0.0 2012-14-06 5
 (The only way I will travel now) I traveled Europe last year and wish I knew about this. This year I am already planning my next trip around this app. Well done!

Version 2.0.0 2012-13-06 2
 (App won't "connect to server"!) I've read so many good things about this app, yet it steadfastly refuses to cooperate on my 4S and updates haven't changed a thing! I'm quite sure it's AIRBNB's issue, as I'm in a large city with no subpar connectivity issues....guess I'll have to attempt reinstallation of the app. Based on earlier reviews, it sounds like I'm not alone in my frustration.

Version 1.4.2 2012-13-06 5
 (The coolest App for all Travelers!) This App is one of the best designed and user friendly App I have seen in a long time! This outlet to find the neatest , most unique places is amazing! The pictures are great, and the whole concept and idea is fantastic! So excited to have this recommended by a fellow traveler! 5 stars! *****

Version 1.4.2 2012-13-06 3
 (Getting there...) Still a few big fixes and things I need the native website on, but it's getting pretty close. Keep up the good work!

Version 2.0.0 2012-13-06 3
 (Good to review but no editing option?) The allows to see the cities you want, but it doesn't allow you to edit and delete cities you don't want. I want to keep only the cities I want to see

Version 2.0.0 2012-13-06 5
 (Love the improved speed) Improved speediness all around and good functionality. Changed my rating to 5 stars as there has been a significant bump in the loading times! Great job, devs! Now I don't have to keep re-logging in every time I close out of the app! I actually like the new icon as it makes it easier to spot Airbnb out of my mess of apps. The old brown suitcase icon made me think it was a packing list app.

Version 2.0.0 2012-13-06 5
 (Manager) Good app. More items geared towards listing management for hosts would be welcome. And, yes, "a"as an app icon? You guys can do better than that.

Version 2.0.0 2012-13-06 5
 (Super) The easiest to use ...

Version 1.4.2 2012-13-06 5
 (Perfect user interface) This is everything that is good and right in the world. That you so much for taking the time to create this beautiful, full featured and powerful application!

 (not only amazing!) It's beyond word!

Version 1.4.0 2012-11-06 5
 (Our go-to app for travel arrangements) This is my first choice to look for places to stay all over the world...and it hasn't failed to result in excellent accommodations.

Version 1.4.2 2012-11-06 4
 (Great App for creative travel) Makes it easy to search and explore private properties for rent.  Give a little more soon I hope with an iPad app?

Version 1.4.2 2012-10-06 5
 (if you're traveling) you don't need my review just download this application 
you'll figure it out faster than you can say wow I'm booking my next airbnb property from a really nice airbnb property. I've been out of town for four months and the airbnb community has been a compelling resource to me. Great for spontaneous travelers as well there's even a section for that ("need a place tonight? Click here)

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-06 1
 (Buggy, buggy, buggy) The new update is not compatible with my 3GS

Version 1.4.2 2012-10-06 5
 (First time host-Rock Castle Dude Ranch) Great app.... Love hosting and our first guests were awesome. Great way to connect people who have extra space and people that want affordable realistic accommodations. Our guest already want to book next year for the CMA music festival.

Version 1.4.2 2012-09-06 5
 (Best app ever!!) Love it.  Makes finding a rental easy and exciting!

Version 1.4.2 2012-09-06 5
 (great!) everything online on my phone

Version 1.4.2 2012-09-06 5
 (Love Air B&B) I first learned about airbnb in April 2011. Some friends and I were planning a trip to San Fran, we knew that the  Haight and Ashbury - Golden Gate Park area was where we wanted to be but finding a hotel room for less that $450 a night that wasn't close to the area we wanted was looking impossible. 
After days of searching the web we stumbled onto Air B&B. Found a cute, perfect, wonderful apartment right around the corner from Haight and Ashbury and the price was incredibly reasonable. 
I absolutely love Air B&B!

Version 1.4.2 2012-09-06 5
 (Awesome app!) Love it.

Version 1.4.2 2012-08-06 5
 (Great!) Awesome app!!

Version 1.4.2 2012-08-06 4
 (Thanks) I think it's great.

Version 1.4.2 2012-08-06 5
 (Great service, Great application) You can access all of AirBnb features: search, messaging, profile, reservations & payment. Excellent.

Version 1.4.2 2012-08-06 4
 (JOSE's LA LATINA) Jose was our first Airbnb experience, and how lucky we are!  His warmth, generosity, and historical knowledge was invaluable - and the apartment was charming, fun - and most definitely - in the heart and pulse of Madrid!  Arriving on a Saturday early morning...the street was quiet and calm - with a lovely plaza and several cafes only 50 yards away!  Upon waking from a long needed nap - we came down to an entirely different scene -- the neighborhood was pounding with people,  fun, and a joyful enthusiasm unlike anything we have experienced in our own country - the only negative being that we couldn't help feel a bit boring!
What we did not expect or understand...is that the pictures of the cathedral - are taken from Jose's flat - I cannot believe there could be a more beautiful view from any window - in all of  Madrid!  The choices of places to eat, drink, and Be Merry were EVERYWHERE - every beautiful destination within walking distance!  La Latina is an amazing Madrid experience...
Thank you Jose!

Version 1.4.2 2012-07-06 5
 (Great App) I definitively recommend it!

Version 1.4.2 2012-07-06 3
 (Problem with messages:/) Overall I like this app, but this bug bother me more and more - some messages open with error and they are just blank. Only complete reinstallation of app helps. And I would love to see a dashboard in next version please.

Version 1.4.2 2012-07-06 5
 (Very good!) Love this app, and most of all Airbnb! 👏👏👏👏😁👌👌👌👌👌👌

Version 1.4.2 2012-07-06 4
 (Great) So helpful and easy to access. Thanks a lot.

Version 1.4.2 2012-07-06 3
 (New Update Fail) Will not load at all on my 4GS

Version 1.4.2 2012-06-06 5
 (Great App) Great app, but I would really like the option to use more filters when searching, ie parking, laundry.

Version 1.3.0 2012-05-06 5
 (Love Airbnb!!!) AirBNB is the only way to travel.  Get the app and start saving tons of money.  You'll enjoy your vacations more too!!!

Version 1.4.2 2012-05-06 4
 (Phone Support was GREAT!) I still have a few glitches with the iPhone app. Some customer service videos will not play, and incoming messages take a while to display properly. I will say though, when I called 24/7 support with a verification problem. Live person helped immediately! Refreshing for a "newer" web-based service!  Like eBay, the transaction experience will depend on the two parties, but so far, impressed with service.

Version 1.4.2 2012-04-06 3
 (Still need work in some areas) It is awesome how information go so fast and how busy we are... I'm almost all the time on the street , if I want to cancel someone or up date my calendar , I have still to go to my computer , I least there is a way and I don't know from the iPad or iPhone .

Version 1.4.2 2012-04-06 5
 (Keeps getting better!) AirBnb has (smartly) continuously been improving their app. I hope this trend continues as they have a good thing going. Thanks, keep it up!

Version 1.4.2 2012-04-06 5
 (Cool and easy to use) Very useful way to find and book holiday accommodations at other people's homes!  Long term sublets are also available.

Version 1.4.2 2012-03-06 5
 (Great app & great site) The app is as great as the site...

Version 1.4.0 2012-03-06 3
 (Helpful, but could be better.) This is a good app for keeping contact with potential guests & searching for a place to stay. I'd give it 5 stars if it had mobile access to the personal calendar. I'm on the go during the day & away from my lap top so it's a bit of a pain to regulate. I'd be able to book much quicker if I could see what was going on.

Version 1.4.0 2012-03-06 5
 (Great UX/UI company and app) I think the app is great for scanning listings and basic messaging. As a host, you can't really do the research in this app on guests that you'd want to do, but that's fine to do on the computer. Great UI and very fast.

Version 1.4.2 2012-03-06 4
 (Fantastic App-needs more functionality) This is a great app for quick AirBnB needs. It could use a bit more of the Dashboard functionality for Hosts and an IPad version!!!!   This is my second review a d do I'm hopeful the bugs and crashing have been worked out with the new update!

Version 1.4.2 2012-03-06 3
 (Still crashes) Love the website and service. But app still crashes on my 3GS. It won't even open.

Version 1.4.2 2012-02-06 5
 (Great app for a great service) The best part is that my messages and the profiles of the members that are in my itinerary are available when I don't have internet access, which is great for traveling!

Version 1.4.2 2012-02-06 5
 (Love Airbnb) wouldn't travel without it.

Version 1.4.2 2012-02-06 5
 (A great place...) A great place to find a great place...

Version 1.4.0 2012-01-06 3
 (Need calendars, pricing, & iPad version) Decent interface but it should be more host friendly: you can't see the prospective prices of an inquiry, view your own calendar, or look at your payment transactions. 

Also, there is no proper iPad version! Update this please!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-01-06 5
 (Awesome) Awesome

Version 1.4.0 2012-30-05 4
 (Super sight, awesome app.) We love airbnb and have stayed and booked with them before, with awesome results!

Version 1.4.0 2012-30-05 5
 (Safe and secure) Helpful for low budget traveller

Version 1.3.0 2012-30-05 1
 (Bring back the previous app icon!) The new on is uninspiring.

Version 1.4.0 2012-29-05 5
 (Slick interface) One of the better UIs and makes you want to travel more. Time to open the app again

Version 1.4.0 2012-29-05 5
 (Paris) Our first time stay was in Paris, in an amazing flat we found through airbnb it was safe & easy to use. I recommend it to everyone :)

Version 1.3.0 2012-28-05 2
 (Won't let you login into app with Facebook) The app will not let you login with Facebook. It has the button to login with Facebook, it goes out, tries to login via your Facebook app, but still asks for username and password when you get back to the airbnb app. 

Waste of time if you used Facebook login to set up the app.

Version 1.4.0 2012-28-05 5
 (Great!) Awesome easy to use app.

Version 1.4.0 2012-28-05 5
 (Best App Ever!) I love this app! It is super easy to use and I am sure it will get me out of a lot of sticky situations in the future! Can't wait to use it again!

Version 1.4.0 2012-27-05 4
 (Great service, good app) Love it

Version 1.4.0 2012-27-05 5
 (Great) Great service, great ap. change the icon back -- way too plain!!!

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 4
 (Love the app...) ...HATE the new app logo. Please bring back the suitcase.

Version 1.3.0 2012-26-05 3
 (If it would only start-up...) The idea behind the app is great BUT I find myself deleting the app all the time to reset it.

It's more useful if you are using it as a guest. The platform for hosting is still very simple. I still can't find my hosting calendar, and much less manage it !!!

I log in with my Facebook account and unless I'm on a wifi network, I can't log in. 

I've pretty much given up using it. When I get a reminder on the lock screen I'd rather wait to be in from of a computer to check messages...

Version 1.3.0 2012-26-05 5
 (Great Service) It's the first place I check when I travel now. 3 weeks in Italy were awesome and off the beaten path with Air BnB. 

Only suggestion: please bring back the old icon. It was my favorite app icon on my phone.

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 4
 (Overall awesome) Really happy with the app about 90 percent of time. Would be even better if I didn't have the occasional bug with emailing prospective guests (sometimes they don't get the email which can cause drama ) Also world love to be able to delete emails from the inbox & leave reviews for people via the app. I like the new icon- simple is best.

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 5
 (Awesome) Easy to use and awesome design

Old Icon is much better than the new one

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 5
 (An already awesome service) Allows us hosts to take it to the next level with this app. Thanks!

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 5
 (Great App) Now with facebook sso working...

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 5
 (Love the app) It works great. So easy to book.

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 4
 (Good but) What's with the horrible icon? Ever heard of something called TASTE?

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 5
 (great app!) i rented my place through this!

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 5
 (Awesome.) Great experience with this app. They obviously put a lot of care into developing it.

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 4
 (Overall not bad) It's a good mobile app. The only problem I have is that it keeps crashing when I look at the map. Please fix :)

Version 1.4.0 2012-26-05 5
 (AWESOME!) Don't leave home without checking out this app. Whether you need a room for a night or a house for a month, you'll find lots of great options available.

Version 1.4.0 2012-25-05 5
 (Suitcase) I miss your old icon!! - that is all.

Version 1.4.0 2012-25-05 4
 (Great app but I miss the cool icon :() You had the prettiest app icon in the entire app store.  It was colorful, meaningful and looked amazing with a bit of 3d perspective.  By far the easiest to spot out of all my apps.

Now it is indistinguishable, practically colorless, and meaningless.  I'm not going to take away stars for this, overall the app is great and I've recommended many friends to try this service.  I'm just sad to see it go...

It would be great if you could prevent the app from taking control of audio until I actually watch a video.  I want my music to keep playing.

Version 1.3.0 2012-25-05 3
 (current version keeps crashing) I like AB but current version keeps crashing.

Version 1.3.0 2012-24-05 4
 (Air B'nB new application.) Hi Everybody! This application is a great short cut, if you have an iPad, but do not aspect to be able to see it all... Is just a short cut. I could manage few thing pretty well, like calendar and info, but you cannot see for example, how much a possible guest will make you earn, for example. Good if you are on a run, or just your lists are so hot you have to get fast in touch with a possible new guest.
Hope this can be improved with full possibilities, like the great system they gave you to access from your computer!

Version 1.3.0 2012-24-05 4
 (Great service, great app!) Simple and straight forward. Just wish I could see the cost of hosting or traveling reservations.

Version 1.3.0 2012-24-05 2
 (Great source but...) This app crashes on me ALOT!!! Getting really tired of it it just stops working and doesn't even let me log in w fb.

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-05 5
 (Travel) Great resource

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-05 5
 (Airbnb is incredible) The app is pretty great as well.

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-05 3
 (Z) Crashes every time when I want to see upcoming bookings and customer service page; does not open every time when I sign up...

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-05 4
 (Love the app) Great app...but does seem to crash every once in a while, still love it. How about an iPad version?

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-05 4
 (Awesome!!!) Love the ui. Super stable. Occasional glitches with "log in w fb" feature, but that's minor. 

Overall, im addicted.

Version 1.3.0 2012-22-05 3
 (Not bad) Just started using the app and it is pretty good

Version 1.3.0 2012-22-05 5
 (Fantastic app!) I absolutely love this app. iPad version please!!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-05 3
 (GA3) I have faced serious password problems. Can only log in through facebook. Even after i registered directly on website.

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-05 1
 (Lots of bug and not really working) I just uninstalled mine, keep having problems signing on and quit unexpectedly

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-05 5
 (Anacortes Loves AirBnB) AirBnB makes it so convenient and easy to post your space. I am totally ready for tourist season and already have two full weeks booked for the summer! Now where am I going to travel this Summer?!

Version 1.3.0 2012-19-05 4
 (Airbnb.... Too cool) Really enjoy the ease of use of this app.
Where's the iPad version?

Version 1.3.0 2012-19-05 5
 (The best) Love AIRBNB

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-05 4
 (Best app) Airbnb app is so convenient to use it, it helped me a
Lot
I book my
Reservations, and also to get in touch with the hosts.

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-05 5
 (A great resource for host and travelers) I came across a segment on Good Morning America regarding saving money during summer travels. The information provided about AirBnB.com really caught my attention. Discovering the ease of maneuvering thru the site only added to my curriousity. Within a short time I booked my first travel to NYC and found a perfect place to stay. I shared with a friend who immediately listed their property on Cape Cod and have already served guest.  These experiences have motivated me to list a guest room in my own home. It is an excellent opportunity to suplimemt income and to make new acquaintances from all walks from many places across the glob,

Version 1.3.0 2012-17-05 2
 (I hate the crashing!!) I'd really like to give this a proper review, but can't because.. It ... Keeps ... Crashing!!!!!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-17-05 1
 (Crashes!!!) This app is a great idea and concept if it worked! It crashes way too much preventing you from viewing all the details off the rental. Fix the crashing and I may be able to give it more stars, because it's useless if I can't see all the information.

Version 1.3.0 2012-17-05 3
 (Keeps crashing) Keeps crashing now. Used to work fine earlier

Version 1.3.0 2012-16-05 3
 (Good) Not very stable.!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-15-05 4
 (Private DC Suite Spacious & Modern) Good working app. Would like to have better calendar and booking functionality. But a great tool for hosts and guests.

Version 1.3.0 2012-15-05 4
 (Great App just a couple of shortfalls) Love the service, and the app brings much of the website functionality to my handheld. Still missing things (like pre-approval) and login is buggy but otherwise great work.

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-05 5
 (Easy and fun!) They've taken the guesswork out of couch surfing! Great job and a lot of fun.

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-05 4
 (Love it!) I love the app and it actually seems like it shows more locations on the map than the website does. 

When will there be a larger screen version for the iPad is all i want to know.

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-05 5
 (Airbnb) All I can say is wow you got a nice thing goin...and I love it.
     Best Wish's
      Jerome

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-05 5
 (Очень нативно сделано!) Прекрасный функционал, возможности и юзабилити. Спасибо разработчикам!

Version 1.3.0 2012-13-05 4
 (Well-made app) Fun to use, authentication is buggy. Good app overall!

Version 1.3.0 2012-12-05 1
 (Cant exit map!!!) Nice looking but once you click on the detailed map you cant get back to the listing or even to the home page. So its now stuck on a map. Useless.

Version 1.3.0 2012-12-05 4
 (Use The Website) The concept is great, and I was amazed by how many great locations/rentals were available from all over the world. The only problem is the app..it gets very frustrating when it crashes over and over (seems to happen the most when clicking on the amenities button) and you have to scroll thru all the previous locations. I love Airbnb but for now I'll go straight to the website instead of using the app.

Version 1.3.0 2012-12-05 4
 (Awesome so far!) Air bnb is wonderful

Version 1.3.0 2012-12-05 4
 (Easy To Use) Please make a version for iPad.

Version 1.3.0 2012-12-05 4
 (Great app but needs a few more features) Missing calendar management and other listing management capabilities.

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-05 3
 (Great service but the app is crap) Airbnb is great. They have tons o properties all over the world. And their app has all the functionality you need. But it is hard to log in through Facebook and crashes all the time. It has stopped me from responding to inquiries about my apartment

Version 1.3.0 2012-09-05 3
 (Good app but does crash) Specifically when you click on amenities

Version 1.3.0 2012-09-05 5
 (I LOVE THIS APP!!) I have used it and I have loved every experience!!! :) awesome!

Version 1.3.0 2012-08-05 5
 (Awesome) Airbnb is heaven sent! What a genius idea and well designed app!

Version 1.3.0 2012-07-05 5
 (Luv Airbnb) This iPhone app is awesome.   Helps us respond to guest faster.

Version 1.3.0 2012-07-05 1
 (Crashes constantly) Airbnb is a great site but their app crashes constantly. Very frustrating. For such a great site I wish their app worked better.

Version 1.3.0 2012-06-05 2
 (Crashes constantly) For the devs - @amenities and map navigation (regularly flips back to US map from UK, eg, then usually crashes). 

It's a great looking app- just doesn't function well.

Version 1.3.0 2012-06-05 5
 (My Fav Travel App & Company) Airbnb is pretty much my favorite brand and service and their app is so elegant and complements their whole amazing service offering well. I am an avid host and evangelize the product and app to any and all that will listen and is a company I would love to web work for :)

Version 1.3.0 2012-05-05 2
 (Can't log in) It's a good app...once I'm able to log in.  After trying to log in through Facebook 5 times(!), I'm giving up.

Version 1.3.0 2012-04-05 4
 (Its good!) Visually very pleasing app, love the UI, icon is of course fantastic. I'm giving 4 stars due to unstabillity issues, it crashes from time to time, and on some parts its a bit laggy...
But in overall more than a good app.

Version 1.3.0 2012-04-05 5
 (Great apps) I m so thrilled to find this fabulous site, very informative and ready to explore the world with amazing prize, we are going to Bali Indonesia and Vietnam this summer
Thank you

 (Daniil) Very very very very best!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-03-05 1
 (Crash app!!!) Ok, how did this app get 4,5 stars is a misery to me bigger than the Bermuda triangle! It crashes before it opens! I used to have it and it affected the performance on my iPhone, so I deleted it. But I've been renting my apt and needed to stay on top on my communication with guests don't installed it again in hopes of it being better. What a disappointment! The only thing it's good for it notifications. At least i know when I get a message, so I don't have to check my email all the time. Thats all it's good for though. Don't even think about starting to type the response because the app will crash on you!!!! FIX IT PLEASE!!!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-03-05 1
 (Keeps crashing!!) Cant even finish a search, the app keeps crashing!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-02-05 1
 (crashes way too much!) I really like this app…but it crashes way too much. Hurry up and fix it so I can book reservations. It crashes when I press the amenities button.

Developer please fix this app. and I will re-review

Version 1.3.0 2012-01-05 5
 (Nadia v) Yea it crashes and asks you log in over and over, but this is THE BEST WAY to book places to stay at all over the world! Great deals, nice ppl, AWESOME

Version 1.3.0 2012-01-05 5
 (Great) Great EZ app to use.

Version 1.3.0 2012-01-05 5
 (Great service for travelers) Very usefull

Version 1.3.0 2012-01-05 4
 (Love airbandb) Airbnb people are great! I love being Ble to share my home be art with others. I just wish I could meet them all! The app needs a lot of work however. Does not work on the iphone and is just a little better on the iPad. I have always had to go on a computer to get anything done

Version 1.3.0 2012-30-04 1
 (Poor Facebook integration) Very limited functionality. Crashes 50% of the time when logging in via facebook

Version 1.3.0 2012-30-04 5
 (:)) Love!!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-29-04 1
 (Always requires re-logging in and crashes) It is in theory a great app but impossible to actually use since it asks me to log in every single time I open it and subsequently often crashes. Needs updating

Version 1.3.0 2012-29-04 5
 (That is a good app) Airbnb, a clever app, you meet people and you get little bit incentive. Helping them to move around with good deals
Great idea.

Version 1.3.0 2012-28-04 1
 (Too many "Air" crashes...) This is a great app--when it works. Over the past few days, however, it's done nothing but crash each time I click on a rental or as I'm trying to read the information on one. Please get this bug fixed.

Version 1.3.0 2012-27-04 5
 (Super App) Excellent for tracking reservations, communicating with guests and all things Airbnb!

Version 1.3.0 2012-27-04 5
 (Muito bom - Very Good) Impressive App.
This app can be better than the website.

Version 1.3.0 2012-26-04 3
 (Bug prevents entering Credit Card Expiration) Not a big deal. Would have still given it 4 stars for execution, ease of use, design, but I HATE app developers that make it difficult to get app support. 

Go on, click the app support button and it takes you to a web page. Try and find out how to give feedback. It's impossible.

Dear AirBnB:

We are loyal customers tryin to give you a helping hand with constructive feedback on bugs, etc. it's free. It's painless. Make it easy for us. Within app even?

Ps. When entering credit card info for a rental, You have card expiration month & year in the same field divided by a diagonal slash. There is no way within the app or manually to toggle between the month and date, thus after entering month, no way to enter year. Thus no way to pay via your app. Thus wasted my time. Thus rendered the app useless in the area of booking a rental. 

Suggestion: create second separate field for year. Problem solved.

Version 1.3.0 2012-26-04 4
 (Would love to see more hosting features) Very well done app, but would love to see more features for people who have listings. In particular, the ability to see and confirm reservation requests would be great, especially since you send push notifications about them, and they must be dealt with within 24 hours.

Version 1.3.0 2012-26-04 5
 (Please make an iPad app!) I love the app but would love to see an iPad app.

Version 1.3.0 2012-25-04 5
 (Great.) Not often does an app work as well/better than a company's already amazing site. This one does.

Version 1.3.0 2012-25-04 5
 (Very Good) The app is just beautiful! I found it to be very user friendly as well. The best part is that the app works seemlessly and doesn't crash like most apps out there. P.s. I don't know why some people are having problems with this app crashing? The app works just fine on my iPod. Maybe some of these people had a virus on their device.

Version 1.3.0 2012-25-04 5
 (NYC with my family) Recently planned a trip with my daughters and parents to NYC.  I was able to find comfortable and reasonably priced accommodations for my parents in ideal locations!  LOVE, love, LOVE airbnb.  I have already recommended it to at least 5 people!

Version 1.3.0 2012-25-04 2
 (I love the thought) Behind this app, but crashes almost immediately when I click on a rental.

Version 1.3.0 2012-25-04 4
 (Great app) So good to find what I was looking for!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-24-04 5
 (Awesome!!!) So easy to use!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-24-04 5
 (Sick Awesome!!!!!!!!!!) What the what! Love it!

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-04 2
 (Lame) The app has crashed 4 times in the last two minutes. Can we say annoying?

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-04 5
 (Loved it!) Very handy app.

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-04 1
 (Crashing today) I love this app & have used it before without prob. But it keeps kicking me out. Bummer

Version 1.3.0 2012-22-04 5
 (Wonderful service & experiences) I am totally impressed with Airbnb's site & service  I travel a lot and as a single, senior woman I have found Airbnb provides me fantastic lodging. Before them, I was spending a fortune on B&B's because I felt much safer there than hotel or motels. I have saved hundreds & enjoyed the family-like feel to their host's places
Their accommodations have been beautiful & family like. Their headquarters staff are extremely helpful & professional. 
My only problem is that there are not more of them, especially nearer to national parks. I am on a quest to visit every one of them
You go AIRBNB ! You rock!

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-04 2
 (Keeps crashing! Full of bugs!) It's great when it works, but it seems to crash every 10mins or so. So frustrating!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-04 3
 (Great app but tends to crash) Love airbnb, and love the app. But it seems like it crashes 1 out of 3 times I'm using it. Please fix this, airbnb!

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-04 3
 (Prone to crashing but otherwise good) The app is not a mirror of the site and should not be expected to be so IMO. However it's pretty good, simple to navigate but prone to crash. I'd like a better starting page as the collections page seems illogical place to start.. Would be better to start at inbox or account page.

Version 1.3.0 2012-20-04 5
 (So convenient!) Upon booking a trip, I usually use my computer, but with this app I can message the owners, change my profile, view al the places I want to go- its basically the same thing! Really handy to have if you like to travel a lot. Love it! Have had it for almost a year!

Version 1.3.0 2012-19-04 2
 (Great service, buggy app) Airbnb on my iPhone is such a bad experience I've stopped recommending the service to people out of embarrassment of the iPhone app.  It loses my login all the time, asks for new approval from Facebook almost every time, and often still won't login. I don't trust it. Just use the web app on a pc.

Version 1.3.0 2012-19-04 2
 (Airbnb) This version of the App still has a long way to go, it's only halfway, you still cant do half the the stuff you can on the website sadly.

Version 1.3.0 2012-19-04 5
 (Excellent) Iphone app works great, can update profile & everything.  Thanks abnb!

Version 1.3.0 2012-19-04 1
 (Lame app) I love airbnb but as a host this app is pretty useless. Please Airbnb get all over this. Your app is like a lame nights stay at a second rate bnb. Not your style. Mobile webpage also useless. Needs help.

Version 1.3.0 2012-19-04 1
 (Great website. Horrible app.) Full of bugs. Crashes at least 9/10 times. Very annoying when you are trying to log in and it won't work even after 100 tries. Once inside, 9/10 the app actually works.  Please work on this app more. It's a great website and customer service is incredible.

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-04 5
 (Works great for me!) I just became a member, got the app add made two bookings! Love it. No crashes or bugs. Great UI.

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-04 2
 (airbnb ap for ipad) love the airbnb site but suffer trying to use the ap. It crashes and is full of weird inconsistent glitches. One day I can see my upcoming events, the next I cant. I will be very happy once it runs well

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-04 3
 (Great service, lame app.) App keeps crashing.

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-04 5
 (Airbnb best travel accommodation App in the world!!!) The idea as the essence is brilliantly simple, rent the space you do not use! You can sub rent a bed or a huge villa at the same time, by the day, by the month, eliminating the days you have friends over, or you are throwing a party for your birthday and you need the place to yourself. Total freedom for both sides, for both parties, though complete strangers, all become a Woldwide group of friends. Safest way to do your payments too and ensure that all went as planned even days after the trip. The air bnb team has improved all procedures, with a caring support team and someone there for you 24/7. That is what I call a strong team! Thank you air bnb!

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-04 2
 (Crashing) Great app but keeps crashing. Please fix.

Version 1.3.0 2012-17-04 3
 (Great promise. Wish it worked better.) I love the service and would get a lot of use out of the app. And it's even well-designed. But it times out, crashes, and throws errors all the time. Can rarely log in or check inbox successfully.

Version 1.3.0 2012-16-04 5
 (Fantastic service, site, and app!) :)

Version 1.3.0 2012-16-04 3
 (Great website) The mobile app crashes far too much though.

Version 1.3.0 2012-16-04 1
 (The app is no good) The app looks nice but it doesn't do what should! When I put the dates of my trip it shows me all apts even those which are not available!! Also when I look for an apt for 1 night it shows me apts with minimum 3 nights of stay.

Version 1.3.0 2012-16-04 4
 (Great app) A few crashes, but a very great functional app. Awesome!

Version 1.3.0 2012-16-04 3
 (Good app) I like this app, but have had it crash several times while trying to use it. I also wish there was a way to email or text the listing to a friend. Overall, I like the app.

Version 1.3.0 2012-15-04 4
 (Great app!) Really enjoy using this app! Easy to navigate through site, very user friendly! However, I have also experienced quite a few crashes, but besides that, it's a great app!

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-04 5
 (So far so good, prepping for first travel with booked accommodation) No crashes for me.
An incredible service.

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-04 1
 (Hate the App!) It crashes. It freezes. It's slow. It lacks essential features. (Seriously? You made an App for a hotel like service, and it does not have a calendar? Well, I suppose dates don't matter when you're trying to book guests...) 

Aside from all that, it's fine.

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-04 1
 (Very Intuitive but crashes frequently) Crashes every time I click on Amenities or property details. iPhone 4S. Not usable until the bug is fixed.

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-04 2
 (Fix the bugs then it will be awesome) Gorgeous graphics. App appears very good & useful--IF it didn't crash constantly. :(

Version 1.3.0 2012-13-04 2
 (Crashing) The app is beautiful but countinuously crases

Version 1.3.0 2012-13-04 1
 (Crashed every time I used it.) I tried four different times, and each time it left the program and crashed my phone.

Version 1.3.0 2012-12-04 1
 (New versión does not work, keeps asking for update, null error,) It is really annoying, still does not work ,

Version 1.3.0 2012-11-04 1
 (Application doesn't work) I can't login with my Facebook login, nor directly with my email address. It simply freezes and nothing happens afterwards

Version 1.3.0 2012-11-04 4
 (Would love to add photos to my listing) If only the app had that functionality!

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-04 5
 (Great) Very useful service!
PS: pls fix the crash when open the app from push notifications

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-04 1
 (THIS APP DOES NOT WORK) It works all the way through until you hit "Book It". I called tech support.. They knew it is a problem but are "still working on fixing it". Argh!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-04 1
 (Buggy - keeps crashing) Please update this soon. The whole point of this app is the convenience of being able to search and book while mobile. I can't do that if after a minute, it crashes! :(

Version 1.3.0 2012-09-04 4
 (We use AirBNB more than hotels now.) The site is great and the app is pretty darn good way to book when you're out and about. It is easier to book days ahead of time and then you might as well use a computer. But when we wanted to book for right away, the easy-to-access customer service made it happen for us. They were great. 

Only problem, I wish I didn't have to log in every time because that means logging out of my Facebook to log in to my wife's an it's a pain.

Version 1.3.0 2012-09-04 5
 (Love airbnb) Awesome app , great concept! Thanks Airbnb

Version 1.3.0 2012-09-04 1
 (Crashes after 20 seconds) Too bad the app doesn't work properly.. For such an useful tool it's a shame that the app can't work. Hopefully they fix it soon.

Version 1.3.0 2012-09-04 5
 (Great app!) Easy to use and perfect for last minute accommodations!

Version 1.3.0 2012-08-04 5
 (Love this app!) Everything you need to use Airbnb is at your fingertips! Love it!

Version 1.3.0 2012-08-04 2
 (Great app but keeps crashing) Please fix!!! Keeps crashing once I open a location to review.

Version 1.3.0 2012-07-04 5
 (Must have app) Using it regularly.

Version 1.3.0 2012-06-04 5
 (Beautiful and functional.) Great app guys. As satisfied with your app as I am with your product (as in: VERY). Keep up the great work!

Version 1.3.0 2012-06-04 2
 (Crashes 20-30 sec after opening) Application is useless -- it closes less then a minute after opening. 
I see that I am not the only one having this problem after update. Fix is needed!

Version 1.3.0 2012-06-04 2
 (airbnb is great - app update is not) I love airbnb and used the app in Australia and NZ last year and it worked but as others have noted, the latest update crashes when you try to open upcoming trips - hope they fix it before I head to Italy in next three weeks otherwise very disappointing.

Version 1.3.0 2012-05-04 5
 (A+ in Customer Service!) We have enjoyed 3 apartments in New York and Seattle and been very pleased with each!  When we had a problem with a booking the customer service team was amazing!

Version 1.3.0 2012-04-04 5
 (Loving it!) I booked a beautiful flat in Paris using the app and it worked flawlessly. Can't wait to use this for all my travels! :)

Version 1.3.0 2012-04-04 2
 (Can't upload) Can't upload photos for apartment I wish to host.  Other than that it's ok.

Version 1.3.0 2012-03-04 4
 (Love it! One of the best UX I've ever had!) 4 stars for repeating glitches with facebook log in. Amazing App and good service

Version 1.3.0 2012-02-04 1
 (From great to broken) This app was nice... Smooth and worked well. Did the recent update and it is now barely usable. As others are saying IT CRASHES PROFUSELY!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-31-03 1
 (Crashes constantly) Crashes every time I scroll past a map, basically unusable. Please fix!

Version 1.3.0 2012-31-03 1
 (Crashes Constantly) I am making a trip soon and any time I try to view anything other than my inbox the app crashes. Looking at my upcoming trips? Nope, app crashes. Want to see my itinerary? Nope, app crashes. I love airbnb, but this app is terrible...

Version 1.3.0 2012-31-03 5
 (Brilliant App) I booked my trip and stay and found the app to be very helpful. 
Love it
Terry-Jo

Version 1.3.0 2012-30-03 1
 (Crash crash...I'm losing Cash!!) I'm a host & my iPhone app keeps continually crashing. It used to crash every once in a while but after I installed the latest upgrade, it crashes every time I use it. It would also be nice if they added the standby feature on the app for hosts & guests alike. After all, the more $$ I make as a host & the more $$ guests spend, It's more $$ that Airbnb makes. I Hate the App! but love the site. Fix it already guys!!! Come on, y'all already slipping!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-29-03 4
 (Awesome) I just recently started using Airbnb and Im hoping to rent this summer. Besides the fact, this App is sweeet. People respond so quick such great listing with great prices!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-29-03 5
 (Nice app) I realy love thi app and i am going to rent this summer

Version 1.3.0 2012-28-03 1
 (Frequent crashes) I love the airbnb concept, but my iPhone app keeps crashing when looking at property details. This is extremely annoying especially if you are on the road without a laptop and are relying on this app to look for your next place to stay. Had to "divert" to regular hotels (using Kayak's app) several times just because of this. Without the crashing I would rate this app a 5 star.

Version 1.3.0 2012-27-03 5
 (Simply GREAT! +++++) Love it.

Version 1.3.0 2012-27-03 5
 (Wonderful App) I use Airbnb all over the world. I recommend this as the best accommodation when traveling.

Version 1.3.0 2012-27-03 4
 (I love airbnb!! Good web&app give me the best place to stay!!) Just being great!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-26-03 3
 (Good) I like the app but I wish it would show my photography jobs and also it doesn't seem to show the bookings for my own listing.

Version 1.3.0 2012-26-03 5
 (LOVE this app/service!) I'm in the airline industry and was told of this site from a co-worker.   I enjoy staying in places that give the feel/experience of being a local, not a tourist, so I will be using airbnb.com for most of my trips, no matter where my adventure takes me!

Version 1.3.0 2012-26-03 5
 (Awesome app) Awesome app and well done

Version 1.3.0 2012-26-03 5
 (New to me) I just found out about this service from a friend and was please to find they had an app, it's easy to use and so far the experience is very good.

Version 1.3.0 2012-25-03 5
 (Great app) The app is very easy to use. I can't imagine a better experience with such a service.

Version 1.2.3 2012-25-03 5
 (THEE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL) I love airbnb and the app is perfect pairing for quickly finding AMAZING places to stay! I will never stay in another hotel, it's budget friendly and when you find a great host you will make a new friend. There are many rental places out there but Airbnb is by far the best!!!!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-25-03 5
 (Awesome!) Very nice app! To be perfect they just need to built an Ipad App :)

Version 1.3.0 2012-25-03 5
 (Most amazing pre-travel booking solution) Amazing for any length travel abroad!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-24-03 5
 (Jb) So handy!

Version 1.3.0 2012-24-03 1
 (Crashed) Tried it, deleted it.  Constantly crashes.

Version 1.3.0 2012-24-03 1
 (All beauty, no brains.) Not sure how the rating is still so high since it seems that everyone else is having the same problem I'm having: constant crashes! Been trying to list my place but no avail. Beautiful or not, this app has been worthless. Shame too, since in general, I like airbnb.

Version 1.3.0 2012-24-03 5
 (Excellent!) Great!

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-03 5
 (Awesome!!) I love this apps. I used it for the first time and it was an amazing experience!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-23-03 3
 (meh) i LOVE this service, but the app crashes a lot.

.. Read all my reviews on crosswa.lk ..

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-03 5
 (Sick) Awesome on road trips. Extension of the website

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-03 5
 (Great app!) Not sure about the negative reviews here. I'm using a 4S with the latest OS and no problems. It does what I need it to and that's it.

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-03 2
 (Ambitious vibrant doesn't work) Looks great but has no functionality. Crashes, times out, and sadly the website isn't much better. It took far too much effort to book a room and now that I have this app continues to cause problems in contacting my host. If this costs me money it's going down to one star.

Version 1.3.0 2012-21-03 2
 (Limited functionality) Edit:  I have an iPhone 4 running version 4.2.8. and am still experiencing constant crashes. I have realized that it is not limited to the map or any particular scrolling.  I have a stay coming up that I cannot view.  If the app worked, it would be gorgeous, intuitive, and utilitarian and well-worth five stars.  But it crashes constantly and it's been at least a month with no update in sight.

---- Old Review ----

Love Airbnb, but this app crashes every time I try to scroll below the map, no matter how many times I reboot my phone and reinstall the app. I assume the reviews are down there, and they are a key part of the decision to stay at particular places. 

Therefore, the app itself is of limited usage. Fix this, and it's five stars. 'Till then, I have to go to the website to read reviews and book, which is cumbersome.

Version 1.3.0 2012-19-03 1
 (its not possible to login. not with FB and not with EMail) this is already since 2 weeks now. As you rank down your customers when they not respond in time you should really try and fix it!

Version 1.3.0 2012-19-03 5
 (Great app) Very interactive app. It has never crashed on me and is so easy to use.

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-03 5
 (Love the idea) I used this in SF and it saved me hundreds. They seem to be responsive to feedback and improving the app.

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-03 5
 (Almost perfect) As a User Experience designer, I have pretty high expectations when it comes to application design. This one is an example of almost perfect user experience that allows for a fully functioning mobile extension of the web experience. If you use AirBNB, you MUST HAVE this app.

Version 1.3.0 2012-18-03 5
 (Awesome App!) I can spend hours browsing property on this app. Unique app if you're renting anything from a room to a castle. The only thing missing is a "Share" button to message or email this App to others.

Version 1.3.0 2012-17-03 5
 (The coolest app!) This app is so much fun to browse through!!

Version 1.3.0 2012-17-03 5
 (Love LOVE Love !!!) This app is everything and More! Great properties, with a fantastic organized app. My only suggestion is a way to email or text or send somehow, to a friend. Because my friend and I are planning a trip and I wish we could have a way of keeping track of each others cool property finds. (I can only keep track of my own in the started area)

Version 1.3.0 2012-17-03 5
 (Have to have it.) Excellent. All the info. I need and helps me respond quickly to prospective guests.

Version 1.3.0 2012-17-03 2
 (Crashes! Bugs!) Great idea, but the app isn't functional yet. It crashes in multiple instances and doesn't allow for some pretty simple functionality.

Version 1.3.0 2012-15-03 1
 (Does not work. Crushed on opening.) Not worth it.

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-03 5
 (Love it) Helps me a lot and works great!

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-03 5
 (This app changed my life!) Works Well.

Version 1.3.0 2012-14-03 5
 (Great way to travel) I can't believe that someone had not thought of this sooner.

Version 1.3.0 2012-13-03 1
 (Pls fix whatever causing the crashes!) The app would always crash from time to time but since the last update it has came to a point that is just purely embarrassing to have a product out there that functions so poorly. It crashes when simply trying to load
Inbox or scroll down on the screen. As for functionality it also lacks critical information such as the amount paid or received for a previous rental. With an easily duplicable business model, if airbnb still puts out trashy app like this,  something else will take over easily!

Version 1.3.0 2012-13-03 3
 (iPad) I know it's compatible but when will you have an actual iPad app???

Version 1.3.0 2012-12-03 4
 (Functional and fun) While it does crash a bit after updates, it's been so helpful on all of my travels since I've downloaded it. Totally worth it.

Version 1.3.0 2012-11-03 3
 (App now unstable after update) App worked really well prior to the last update. It now frequently kicks me out after a minute or so. Very frustrating, please fix!

Version 1.3.0 2012-11-03 2
 (Crashes constantly) New update keeps crashing :(

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-03 5
 (My guests) I just greeted my first guests and they are great. They're in Austin for SXSW and I hear that AirBnB is here representing and I want to go tell them in person how much I like this ap

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-03 4
 (Good ap, could benefit from added functionality) Overall this is a useful app. As a host, notifications are key in responding to inquiries in a quick efficient way. The major drawback is the lack of calendar function in the app. This would make it much more user/ host friendly.

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-03 5
 (Good) This apps is perfect. It gives me the functionality of the website to manage my listings while I am at the hospital.

Version 1.3.0 2012-10-03 5
 (Awesome) I LOVE IT

Version 1.3.0 2012-09-03 5
 (Airbnb) Um aplicativo claro e fácil de usar.

Version 1.3.0 2012-09-03 5
 (It's a beautiful thing!) What a wonderful system for renting a room or home..member for 3 weeks, and already 3 requests. ))

Version 1.3.0 2012-08-03 3
 (Love this app but...) It's a great app but it crashes constantly!!! Can't use it for more than a minute without it crashing. Please fix this...

Version 1.3.0 2012-08-03 5
 (Great site) Really great site,easy to use,with no crashings bags etc.

Version 1.3.0 2012-08-03 1
 (Love air Bnb) But app keeps crashing. I use it as a consumer/guest.

Version 1.3.0 2012-08-03 5
 (Smooth!) What an intuitive yet complete design! Very happy with this app.

Version 1.3.0 2012-07-03 4
 (Wonderful) Airbnb rocks

Version 1.2.3 2012-07-03 5
 (Great) Air bnb is great

Version 1.3.0 2012-06-03 5
 (Easy and convenient) Better than the web site for browsing. Intuitive and smooth navigation. Beautifully crafted. Handy for hosts!

Version 1.3.0 2012-06-03 5
 (Love this App) And everything in it!
I'm usually rather harsh with my reviews but this app is so well done I can't honestly find a problem with it. 

Perhaps the only thing I would add is payment options in app :)

Version 1.3.0 2012-06-03 5
 (Excellent!) Great app for a great site

Version 1.3.0 2012-06-03 1
 (Great to have if it didn't keep crashing!) This latest version is useless! Great to have an app that allows me to respond to guests' requests quickly, but not if it doesn't stay open. Also agree with previous comment about needing capability to update host's calendar and make special offers; would be nice to be able to edit listing and manage mailbox, too.

Version 1.2.3 2012-05-03 4
 (Nice but IPad App Needed) This product is nice. I have used AirBnB's services twice already. However, AirBnB needs to get with the times and develop an IPad app.

Version 1.3.0 2012-04-03 5
 (Beautiful app) Beautifully made and incredibly functional. Booked my last trip with this app.

Version 1.2.3 2012-02-03 5
 (More than great!) Airbnb is amazing! I love it! So simple, so easy, so useful!!! I'm so excited about the place I booked in 🇷🇺Moscow Russia🇷🇺!!Thank you to whom ever came up with Airbnb!

Version 1.3.0 2012-02-03 1
 (Great Site!) Easy to use- really friendly. I can't understand why/how others have trouble with it found great accommodations in a few minutes. Just wish there was a way to bookmark places that I want to go to.

Version 1.3.0 2012-02-03 5
 (I ❤ Airbnb =)) Nice update .. When are you gonna guys support Arabic language?

Version 1.2.3 2012-01-03 5
 (Wonderful service) I love this app. Just stayed in Key West at a place on Airbnb. Place was great. The customer service from Airbnb was top notch. They called and emailed to make sure all was taken care of. I'll use them (and this app) again for sure!

Version 1.2.3 2012-29-02 5
 (So convenient) As a frequent user I love being connected "on the go."

Version 1.2.3 2012-27-02 3
 (Great, but it could be better.) A great looking app. Does it's job  very we'll in delivering its functions. I wish more reservation info was available with the messaging interface. It would be helpful to reference pricing within messages. 

When replying to messages, there are often multiple topics to cover. It would be helpful to see the text in the previous message as you're writing the reply. 

Other than that, it's great.

Version 1.2.3 2012-25-02 5
 (Great service) Great service and good app.

Version 1.2.3 2012-24-02 3
 (Great!  But needs to be improved a bit) This app is very useful to search for places to stay- easy navigation.  However, if you could be able to save your entire search so that one can search with ease instead of re-entering the date/ location info, that would save a ton of grief (especially when a wonderful place turns up in your search but it is clearly not available the dates specified.
Also, a feature I absolutely love on the website is the calculation of stay based on the dates entered into the search, please add!  And of course it would be SO HELPFUL to be able to see a calendar (like the web version) to be able to see price differentiation and available dates.
I enjoy this app very much, hope there is an iPad version soon!

Version 1.2.3 2012-24-02 4
 (Great service---until it asks for a password) Great app. But there are problems when I went to book a place from the mobile app with passwords (I login with Facebook and that password doesn't work for booking through airbnb) needs a different method to confirm resos. But I love airbnb!! Never disappointed.

Version 1.2.3 2012-23-02 4
 (Good but how 'bout the ipad?) Great service. App would be better if optimized for ipad.

Version 1.2.3 2012-23-02 1
 (This version buggy) Same facebook login problem as others. Previous versions worked fine.

Version 1.2.3 2012-23-02 1
 (Completely unusable.) Can't log in via Facebook. Suggests an upgrade "to (null) version" when there is no new version. Crashes continually. Junk. Disappointing. Deleted.

Version 1.2.3 2012-23-02 5
 (Making renting a snap!) This app has been awesome for rental management. The alerts are great & I can do practically everything on the app that I can do on the site - which is important when I need to get back to potential renters quickly. Thanks Airbnb!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-23-02 5
 (Love this app) This is an awesome app.  Can't believe all the wonderful places I'm starring and at such great prices, cant wait to explore them all!!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-22-02 5
 (This app airbnb.) Shows great prices and sites

Version 1.2.3 2012-21-02 4
 (New things) The opportunity that AirBnb gives is incredible and I am very impressed with the organization of the network.
The app is helpful and although there is a delay at times on getting messages as they come in, I really am happy with the overall experience.

Version 1.2.3 2012-20-02 5
 (Great App!!) Great app!! Would be great if you all could make one for iPad as well!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-19-02 3
 (AirB&b) Search engine is not working well

Version 1.2.3 2012-16-02 3
 (Takes over audio) Why on earth does a travel social networking need to take over my audio?

Version 1.2.3 2012-16-02 5
 (Amazing customer service!!) Great follow up and user friendly web/ app interphase

Version 1.2.3 2012-16-02 5
 (Great site!!!!!) Airbnb is an amazing tool for travelers on the go. My wife and I had no place to stay inPrague and heard from a friend to try airbnb so we did. Never been more pleased with a lodging experience! Fast, cheap, friendly! What more do you want when traveling? I've recommended airbnb to everyone I know and hopefully they start using this great service too!

Version 1.2.3 2012-15-02 5
 (I Love airbnb) The best idea and the best tool for host ever.

Version 1.2.3 2012-15-02 5
 (Missy) Great app. As an host, this def helps me being very responsive and able to reply almost right away to inquiries. Only issue would be abt the 'special offer', it would be good to also have the Pre-approval just like on the website so you do not have to manually compute the amount to charge the potential guest. Other than that, I like Airbnb a lot, I have been averaging $1200 a month by renting out my spare room!!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-11-02 5
 (LOVE.) The App is extremely nifty!  Been using the site for a while now but the App is perfect!

Version 1.2.3 2012-11-02 5
 (Wicked awesome.) This app is really great!  I just got it and I can't wait to put it to good use.

Version 1.2.3 2012-11-02 5
 (Excellent) This app is one of my favorites it is definitely a gem I highly recommend it.

Version 1.2.3 2012-10-02 5
 (It's like shopping, but you get more!!!) Ultimate social travel tool. Future is airbnb... After all who wants to stay @hotels in this economy ?

Version 1.2.3 2012-08-02 5
 (Changes travel for ever) This App is fantastic, and changes the experience of traveling in remarkable ways. Too bad I can't give 6 stars because I would in a heartbeat.

Version 1.2.3 2012-08-02 4
 (Great app!!!) Get it

Version 1.2.3 2012-08-02 5
 (Gorgeous!) Great app and beautiful design.

Version 1.2.3 2012-07-02 5
 (Best for travelers) By far my new favorite app. I'm saving money, staying at prime locations and it's all due to this app. Thanks airbnb!

Version 1.2.3 2012-07-02 4
 (Needs calendar) Easy to use, great but missing an important feature when searching for listings- the calendar/availability. I've wasted my time searching for and finding awesome places then to have to wait to be by a computer to find out if it's booked :( bummer!

Version 1.2.3 2012-06-02 5
 (Love love it!) So easy to use, great pics, can save favs! Just as easy to use as the web version. Have booked places to stay with this app. It's great! I can spend hours on it looking at places all over the world!

Version 1.2.3 2012-05-02 4
 (A but can be an A+) This app has all the ease and functionality of the website. My only criticism is that when a guest sends an inquiry about your space you can only reply with a special offer and not a pre-approval forcing you the math in your head (not a big deal but still a frustration).

Version 1.2.3 2012-04-02 5
 (Great? No, AMAZING.) A new yorker came into my work and we spoke about each of our cities. I mentioned that I wanted to go to NY and she suggested AIRBNB. I am even more prepared to go now. I'm excited and eternally grateful for AirBnb.

DON'T be a lazy traveler, download the app and you will never regret it...whether you're being hosted or hosting it's worth it!!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-03-02 5
 (Air B n B rocks!) Love this app, helps me out in a big way

Version 1.2.3 2012-02-02 5
 (Love it) No need for hotels this is sooooo much better

Version 1.2.3 2012-02-02 5
 (Very good app) Thanks so much for this! I love the interface.

Version 1.2.3 2012-01-02 5
 (Great) thanks for the app

Version 1.2.3 2012-01-02 5
 (I love AirBnB) Such a great support system for hosts and persons searching for great deals!!! I love it

Version 1.2.3 2012-01-02 5
 (Love AirBnB) What a great service and user friendly app! I have nothing but positive experiences with airbnb and my hosts. Better than hotels!!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-31-01 5
 (Good stuff) Super easy to use

Version 1.2.3 2012-29-01 5
 (🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟) I really like this app! It has everything that I need just as on website! Very easy to use! I love it! 👍👍😍

Version 1.2.3 2012-29-01 5
 (Awesome!) Radical!

Version 1.2.3 2012-28-01 3
 (Nice service but needs much better search capability) Nice idea overall to help the masses, but very difficult to search for "log cabin" for example.   

As a whole there are two ways to "find".... "search" and "browse".  Nice browse but terrible search.

I look forward to the next releases.

Also "cleaning fees" are not clearly identified. 

Kevin

Version 1.2.3 2012-28-01 4
 (Great app and service!) We use AirBnB for both travel and hosting. It's easy, intuitive, and the customer service team is very responsive.  Try it!

Version 1.2.3 2012-26-01 4
 (Great app) Its perfect for the major uses and especially for a quick view of upcoming guests :)

Version 1.2.3 2012-26-01 4
 (Sweet app) Great app and very user friendly. Only thing I can't  find a cancellation option.
Also, has a ritual of crashing once a day. Please fix this and it would be perfect.

Version 1.2.3 2012-25-01 4
 (Great start...) Airbnb has made the world just a little bit smaller, now every destinations seems to be within reach...

Version 1.2.3 2012-25-01 5
 (Great Service!) I absolutely love it. I'm traveling thru Tuscany & have met and stayed with the kindest and best people. I will continue to use it again & again! Thanks

Version 1.2.3 2012-24-01 5
 (AirBnb changed my life) Thank you!

Version 1.2.3 2012-22-01 5
 (Love Air B & B) So I've been stalking Air B&B for over a year now. I've been dying to try it out on my travels & I think I've just found the perfect place when we head to Paris this summer - fingers crossed!

Version 1.2.3 2012-17-01 4
 (Making money) It great to be able to check my reservations while out on the town

Version 1.2.3 2012-17-01 5
 (Find cheap rates) I'm in paradise for $39 a night right now because of AirBNB.

Version 1.2.3 2012-17-01 5
 (Easy to use and great features!) Thanks!

Version 1.2.3 2012-17-01 5
 (Love love love) Airbnb is the jam:)

Version 1.2.3 2012-17-01 5
 (Love it!) Very reliable, convenient & easy to use.

Version 1.2.2 2012-16-01 5
 (I love it!) This app is so aesthetically pleasing. It fills almost all of my down time. I have yet to use it to actually book something but am planning a trip to SF very soon and am really excited to finally use this! I will keep everyone posted :)

Version 1.2.3 2012-16-01 3
 (Can't see or change calendar.) As a host who travels a lot, I need to see my calendar from the app when I get reservation requests. I also need to be able to update my calendar from the app. I can't do either with this version. Please update.

Version 1.2.3 2012-14-01 3
 (Great for hosts) Has been really helpful for me as a host.  Needs a few more features but I'm sure they are working on it.  Better calendar integration is key for timely host response.   If we can't see it, we can't book it.

Version 1.2.3 2012-14-01 5
 (Fantastic App - Fantastic Idea) I simply love AirBnb. Their staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The lodging options will suit just about anyone's taste. It is hard to stay in hotels after you experience traveling the AirBnb way.

Version 1.2.3 2012-13-01 5
 (Great app!) We've booked a bunch already. Super user friendly. Love it

Version 1.2.3 2012-13-01 5

Version 1.2.3 2012-12-01 5
 (Air bnb app) Love this app!! It does it all!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-12-01 5
 (Great site) Since I travel a lot, I see this site one of the most helpful and interesting sites. It helps to save time, effort and mostly helps you to save money.

Version 1.2.3 2012-12-01 5
 (Super app) Works so good

Version 1.2.3 2012-12-01 5
 (Fantastic App!!!) I've been working with airbnb for a year and it's app it's the best user friendly tool you'll ever need. Get it, you'll see!

Version 1.2.3 2012-10-01 5
 (Indespensible!) Like the Airbnb website, their iPhone app is meticulously designed and a dream to use. I've booked an apartment while on a train, while sipping coffee at a roadside stand and while waiting for my bags too appear on the carousel! Their "last minute" feature works incredibly well if you find yourself needing a place for tonight in a foreign land!

Version 1.2.3 2012-10-01 5
 (Awesome app) Wish I could get all my friends to get this app so we could travel more. It seems great.

Version 1.2.3 2012-09-01 5
 (Airbnb app useful) It's very easy to get information and can change the way to live. With such application on you phone can be realistic spend a long vacation visiting what you like without any waste of time.

Version 1.2.3 2012-09-01 5
 (Just about perfect!) As a property owner, I can manage almost everything on my iPhone that can be done via computer. My calendars, photos, replying to messages; even account info. Great app for a great company!

Version 1.2.3 2012-09-01 5
 (If you travel, this app is essential.) So useful.

Version 1.2.3 2012-08-01 5
 (Finally!) Finally an easy way to book great accommodations anywhere in the world where we travel.  So much better than Craigslist.

Version 1.2.3 2012-08-01 5
 (very handy app) This app is amazingly well suited to look for properties to rent. Their notifications are great and it allows you to directly contact hosts and easily find directions to the rented properties. Highly recommended for world travelers.

Version 1.2.3 2012-07-01 5
 (Perfect Response Rate) This app is not only aesthetically beautiful with smart functionality, it helps me keep my response rate at 100%

Version 1.2.3 2012-07-01 4
 (Best Travel App) This app came in handy for us during our trip to Paris.  I wish I had discovered it much sooner and looking forward to using in my future travels!

Version 1.2.3 2012-07-01 5
 (Airbnb App A++++) This app is so clean and simple to use!
I'm def going to recommend it to family and friends. Gr8 job by everyone over at Airbnb!!!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-06-01 5
 (Fantastic!) I love this app! I've had wonderful stays in unique places and met interesting hosts. This app is so well designed, allowing you to search by map or city, and so easy to make calls to your host from within the app without figuring out country/city codes. The variety of properties is outstanding and Airbnb is an essential travel tool for me.

Version 1.2.3 2012-05-01 5
 (Great App, Great Service) If your traveling and looking for cheaper accommodations or alternatives to hotels... This is your app... Saved me a ton on travel expenses already

Version 1.2.3 2012-05-01 3
 (Some crashes) Good app to keep connected to your airbnb account. It's crashed a few times, hence the 3 stars, otherwise great app

Version 1.2.3 2012-04-01 5
 (Amazing) Amazing app for an amazing service. I love airbnb.

Version 1.2.3 2012-03-01 5
 (Very nice) Effective friendly. Well done.

Version 1.2.3 2012-03-01 5
 (Great app!) Love it..

Version 1.2.3 2012-02-01 5
 (Superb! Try Luxury, Try Neighborhoods, Replace Hotels with Dream Home w/out the headaches!) Learned of this on LiveFearless with Sam Botta - Thank You! Literally able to stay in places you see on those entertainment interviews inside celebrity homes... in areas where the hotel prices would have been more expensive! Further this site is Safer than Craigslist because the verification process works with this specific purpose. App knows how to make your search easy, booking is fast on this app. Enjoy! Be inspired!

Version 1.2.3 2012-02-01 5
 (Great idea!!) Great idea, we loved the idea and would recommend it! We have tried it and it really WORKS!!

Version 1.2.3 2012-01-01 5
 (Awesome) Thx to Airbnb I only paid $100 to stay in downtown Savannah last night instead of the $250 hotel rates. I love this company and app!

Version 1.2.3 2011-31-12 5
 (Easy peasy!) Love the app, love the service! Thank you for making it easy to keep in touch with our guests.

Version 1.2.3 2011-31-12 5
 (Yay) Like it.

Version 1.2.3 2011-31-12 5
 (Airbnb) I think I have tried every version of this type of website and Airbnb is the best/most user friendly. 
The home owners I have talked with have all been personable and made me want to stay in their place. The prices are realistic and under even a lot of hotels in the area.  
The app is top-notch and exciting. 
I recommend Airbnb and this app highly.

Version 1.2.3 2011-31-12 4
 (Excellent) Great way to see a location like a local...looking forward to our upcoming trip...

Version 1.2.3 2011-30-12 5
 (Why didn't I think of this??!!) Really awesome!! Makes a dream getaway night not just a dream for a single mom with a budget!

Version 1.2.3 2011-29-12 5
 (Best Way To Stay? AirBNB!) I tell everyone about AirBNB because it is the best. This app works very well. AirBNB has helped our travels be safe, cost effective, and fun. I prefer staying with AirBNB over a hotel or hostel anytime because there is an irreplaceable sense of community. Staying with AirBNB hosts help make you comfortable and offer advice when visiting the local scene...that is why you stay with AirBNB.

Version 1.2.3 2011-29-12 5
 (Excellent app) Perfect in every way.

Version 1.2.3 2011-29-12 5
 (Love this app.) Love airbnb, love this app.

Version 1.2.3 2011-28-12 5
 (<3) This site is AMAZING!! It makes travel so much more accessible! And the experience I've had this far is unbeatable. You get meet new people and see the world while on a budget! :)

Version 1.2.3 2011-26-12 5
 (Works great!) Used it in April to book an apartment in Paris for 9 days. Communication tools easy to use, very pleased. Will use again.

Version 1.2.3 2011-25-12 5
 (Airbnb app) I love the app!!! Easy to use .

Version 1.2.3 2011-23-12 5
 (Eye opener) Site easy to get around and opens so many possibilities of available places to stay. Love it!

Version 1.2.3 2011-21-12 1
 (Crap) It would be useful if you could search by cities

Version 1.2.3 2011-21-12 5
 (Wooooow) Excelent graphics and movimentations!
Excellent b&b DB World Wide !

Version 1.2.3 2011-20-12 5

Version 1.2.1 2011-20-12 5
 (Amazing app!!!) Thanks airbnb!

Version 1.2.3 2011-20-12 5
 (Perfect) An even more beautiful extension of an already sleek and comprehensive website. Beauty and utility- my two favorite things!

Version 1.2.3 2011-17-12 5
 (Beautiful design!) I'd expect no less after using the web app, but I'm consistently impressed by the design and UX these guys pump out. Also it's good to find a place to stay or to manage your own listing

Version 1.2.3 2011-17-12 5
 (Great app) Thanks airbnb ,

We can be connected 24h all over the world !

Version 1.2.3 2011-16-12 5

Version 1.2.3 2011-15-12 5

Version 1.2.3 2011-14-12 5
 (Just perfect) Amazing app

Version 1.2.3 2011-13-12 5
 (Ideal app for travelers) Very well designed app, user friendly! They have great customer service. It's a simple way to book last minute all over the world!! And you will likely get a much better accommodations, get the feel of a city or town in a unique way!

Version 1.2.3 2011-12-12 5
 (LOVE LOVE LOVE this site!!) I'm very new to airbnb, but the more I understand it, the more and more I love it an applaud the manner in which it is being run. Being a nervous Nelly in just anyone staying at my ( really my brothers but for all intents and purposes mine) place I was somewhat hesitant at first. I was calling everyday with new questions- each one answered so knowledgeably and friendly by one of your staff there and appreciate the time and attention spent. I look forward to both renting to and from you in the future. Thanks airbnb!!

Version 1.2.3 2011-12-12 5
 (Amazing) Will change the way I book lodging forever!

Version 1.2.3 2011-11-12 5
 (Awesome!) I great idea for an App!

Version 1.2.3 2011-11-12 5
 (Awesome) This app is great, I love how everything is at your fingertips.

Version 1.2.3 2011-10-12 5
 (Excellent implementation of a brilliant idea!) Yup!

Version 1.2.3 2011-08-12 2
 (Crashes and forces me to log in every time) Push notifications are cool, but every single time I open the app from one of them, it crashes. Then I have to go through the startup animation all over again and go out to Facebook to log in again. All in, it takes about 2 minutes to start the app. Two minutes!! Once you're in, it's great though. Fix the crashes and login bugs, please.

Version 1.2.3 2011-08-12 5
 (Saves my life wherever I am!) I've used Airbnb in 5 different cities throughout 3 different countries in the last 8 months. The app has saved me in each location, even abroad without cellular service. So easy to use and so convenient. Sickkkk!

Version 1.2.3 2011-05-12 5
 (Airbnb everywhere) Airbnb is a feature rich site and their mobile app does a good job of delivering all the essentials to manage your listing and reservations from anywhere.

Version 1.2.3 2011-05-12 5
 (Great App) This app is fantastic, integrating PayPal would be fantastic.

Version 1.2.3 2011-04-12 5
 (Easy search) Everything is so easy to search for. 
You discover just as much as you would if you were on a computer.

Version 1.2.3 2011-04-12 4
 (Convenient!) As a host, having the app on my phone makes it soooooo easy to stay competitive and accept reservations and reply to messages immediately. The only issue I have is that it doesn't have everything- I'd love to be able to access my $$$ account and payment info through the app. Just a thought for the next version :)

Version 1.2.3 2011-04-12 5
 (Aribnb wow) It's sooo easy to find what are you looking for , I just love it 
Sam

Version 1.2.3 2011-03-12 5
 (Worked Perfectly!) Booked through AirBnb for the 1st time a couple weeks ago for a trip to NYC. App had lots of apts to choose from and is super easy to navigate. Was nervous, but took a chance. Everything was so smooth. Will use again with no hesitation. Apt was legit, just as advertised. Communications were great from both the owners and app. Tub backed up one day. We reported to AirBnB and they contacted owner. Was fixed within hours and both AirBnB and owners followed up to make sure it was ok. Security deposit was returned on time. Every traveler should have this app!!

Version 1.2.3 2011-03-12 5
 (I Love This App) Wonderful pictures and a great way to dream until my next trip.

Version 1.2.3 2011-02-12 5
 (Fantastic app) This is a great app, even better than the website. Every traveler should have it

Version 1.2.3 2011-28-11 5
 (Functional) This app is well designed and lets me do everything I need to do. It would be nice if i could change currency but that's minor compared to everything the app offers.

Version 1.2.3 2011-28-11 5
 (The App AND the service are GREAT!) I now use AirBnB for all my travel stays.  Saving money at great places is only the side benefit. The real treat is the interesting people you get to meet.  This App just makes using the services that much easier.

Version 1.2.3 2011-27-11 4
 (Great app. Great concept.) Love it. I've hosted. I've traveled. Fab

Version 1.2.3 2011-27-11 5

Version 1.2.3 2011-26-11 5
 (Great app!) Makes managing listings super easy. Great app!

Version 1.2.3 2011-25-11 3
 (This is a great travel app!) The only recommendation for hosts is the ability to upload previously taken photos from your phone instead of only being able to take a photo.

Version 1.2.3 2011-23-11 5
 (Amazing!) I love this app. It opens up a whole new world to being able to travel affordably!

Version 1.2.3 2011-22-11 5
 (One Stop Shop) It's like like going into your favorite store... You know where everything is!

Version 1.2.3 2011-21-11 5
 (Super Easy To Use) Thank you for your efforts in creating such an efficient site. Clearly layed out and labeled nicely and user friendly.

Love it!

Version 1.2.3 2011-21-11 5
 (Excellent Experience!) This is an amazing service I will use again & again! I travel quite frequently for business & pleasure. A friend recommended I use Airbnb.  I was hesitant at first but when calling customer service they we're kind & informative.  I booked our first home and it was exactly as represented! Beautiful and extravagant! Our stay was amazing!  Airbnb will be on my TOP 10 app/services that I recommend to all of my friends!

Version 1.2.3 2011-20-11 5

Version 1.2.3 2011-15-11 3
 (Good concept but bad app!) Im a regular user of the website Airbnb and have guests at least twice or thrice a month. 

The app is a handy one to communicate with guests and know the upcoming reservations but since the last update it's just acting weird and annoyingly! 

1. Almost every time I open the app I've to log in thru Facebook. It takes time to exit the app open fb load fb approve on that page and get back! This bug is the most irritating thing so far. Was not there in the previous version. Log in once and u r done! 

2. When it logs in it detects a bug or crash report and promptly asks to send to developers or click not send. Do you even get a report?!
When I click send mostly I am welcome with a black screen with grey bands on the bottom and top , no icons pictures menu nothing 
And thats not fixed till I remove the app and load it from iTunes not nice at all!! 

2, That crashing happened even with normal log in , couple times. Enough for me to avoid te app and actually turn on my computer and check Airbnb there! 

Pros 
1. Having the notifications is good I get a s notification if I have a message reservation payment etc. that's a good addition with ios5. 
2.Also like the ability to upload photos from camera or to take with the phone camera itself 

3. All info about Airbnb guarantee is not there but that's fine because we want the app to be light on the memory. It's okay not to have the extra fluff on the app. Thanks for that. 

4. Nice collections. But maybe u could remove a few if they are causing an overload of resources. Seems like too many top 40's with high res pictures right at the beginning... We could do with fewer... 

Pls pls
Pls fix those bugs I'm such an ardent fan of the site and the concept and use my iPhone app too. I had bugs now and I had to write a review immediately!

 (Muito bom(very nice app)) Nice app but we're still waiting the iPad version!!! Please hurry up

Version 1.2.3 2011-13-11 5
 (Great app) This app is designed as well as the website, which is awesome.  I wish Facebook was designed this well both in terms of appearance and intuitive function.  My only issue was that at the beginning the login process didn't work, and then eventually it did.  But other than that it's great!

Version 1.2.3 2011-12-11 5
 (Love Airbnb 💙💙💙💙💙) Such a beautiful app.

Version 1.2.3 2011-12-11 5
 (Beautiful app and very user friendly) Love the app! Navigating through it is a breeze; I'm still in shock with how easy it is to find a place right near me when I need it. Airbnb is overall amazing for travel!

Version 1.2.3 2011-07-11 4
 (Awesome) Love the app but for some reason messages in my inbox are gone?

Version 1.2.3 2011-07-11 3
 (Crashes too often on iOs5) Nice app, nice pics. But Push notifications in combination with the app lead to too many crashes and logins.

Version 1.2.3 2011-07-11 5
 (good App and Service) good App and Service

Version 1.2.3 2011-06-11 5
 (Great service, awesome app) Only downsides are fewer filtering options than available through their main site, and no translations available for property descriptions as is available on the main site.

Version 1.2.3 2011-05-11 4
 (AirBnB works) We've used AirBnB for seven rentals in Europe. In Croatia, Italy (4 places), Malta, and Prague. Other than one place in Bari, Italy we had good service & good accommodations. It's mostly up to to the rental unit's owner to provide what they say they they are offering. Overall, we are pleased with what we have gotten. Thanks!

Version 1.2.3 2011-03-11 5
 (Best lodging app for owners and renters) Love the AirBnB app, it easily organizes everything in one place. Works great for owners and renters.

Version 1.2.3 2011-03-11 2
 (frustrating...) As a traveler on a VERY tight budget, it's super frustrating that the MINIMUM price filter is set at $25. I know that this causes me to miss rooms which are available for much less. And again, because I'm on a very tight budget, this makes the app virtually useless to me, which is a bummer because I'm a seasoned airbnb user and I love it in every other way.

Version 1.2.3 2011-02-11 4
 (Great app) It really gave me some great, fun new options.

Version 1.2.3 2011-01-11 5
 (Tj) Very helpful

Version 1.2.3 2011-01-11 5
 (Fantastic app!) Easy to use with robust functionality. Great mobile component to a great offering.

Version 1.2.3 2011-30-10 5
 (Host) Very handy. Just wish I could post guest reviews from the site instead of having to open a web browser.

Version 1.2.3 2011-30-10 5
 (So. Well. Done.) Every part of this app is as well thought out as the service it provides.

Version 1.2.3 2011-29-10 5
 (Best app ever) Very good

Version 1.2.3 2011-28-10 4
 (Brilliant!) This app could use a few enhancements...like seeing your inbox the same way you see it on the computer. It's a great site/business and such a breath of fresh air if you enjoy traveling!

Version 1.2.3 2011-28-10 5
 (Amazing) Such better options than hotels, I'm so glad to have found this

Version 1.2.2 2011-27-10 5
 (Airbnb) Airbnb is the greatest invention since...

Version 1.1.2 2011-27-10 5
 (Begs for an iPad Version) This app is the ultimate dream book, and work desk vacation.

I'm really surprised that it's small-screen only. Hopefully somebody is already working on the tablet version of this stunning resource.

Version 1.2.2 2011-26-10 4
 (Airbnb) I was recently been introduced to this service and I love it!

Version 1.2.2 2011-26-10 5
 (Love love love airbnb...) ... And having the app on my phone helps me manage a busy booking schedule with guests via my iPhone around a busy work and social life. We have used it even while overseas to book last minute places to stay when our hotel sucked, and it was a lifesaver!!!

Version 1.2.2 2011-24-10 5
 (Intuitive) All the functionality you need. Intuitive. Just right

Version 1.1.2 2011-24-10 4
 (Great app) Nice app

Version 1.2.2 2011-23-10 5
 (Beautiful app) Love it!

Version 1.2.1 2011-22-10 5
 (Super app! Prop owner opinion) Heard about it at a restaurant from a friend of the developer and figured what the heck.  Easy enuf to set up, any foibles were my lack of attention.  Have had several guests to our unique guest quarters and each has been so easy it seems to good to be true but it is! The company continues to improve with our satisfaction as an obvious goal.

Version 1.2.2 2011-21-10 3
 (Great app with missing features) Its a great app but I need to be able to 'edit'.

Version 1.2.2 2011-21-10 5
 (Magnificent) Amazing app works great all the time and is a brilliant idea. Love it.

Version 1.2.2 2011-21-10 5
 (Great app!!) Very cool

Version 1.2.2 2011-20-10 5
 (Incredible app) It'll change the way we travel

Version 1.2.2 2011-20-10 2
 (Sneaky, underhanded and beware!) Just booked my first stay, and in order to do so I needed to 'flush out my profile' for the owner of the rental.  For curiosity's sake, I clicked on the 'what my property worth?'. And then Airbnb auto listed me off of my address needed for the rental transaction.  Now I can't remove the listing, and am caught in the limbo of customer support, where they state it will take 'some time' to get back to me.  It took a day to get it de-listed, and the email said that they would consider making changes to the app so it won't autolist your property as a rental.  Changed my rating slightly, but it is still sneaky.

Version 1.2.1 2011-20-10 4
 (Great for last minute bookings) I downloaded this app thinking it would remain useless in my iPhone but found it to be a great resource for last minute lodging.  I found myself stranded in a small town with no vacancies in the hotels.  One tap on my Airbnb app and I found a home to stay in.  It was great!

Version 1.2.2 2011-19-10 5
 (UK Trip) Used Airbnb for the first time to book 3 B&Bs for our trip to England and Scotland. The Airbnb properties turned out to be the best accommodations on our trip. Using the iPhone Airbnb app was easy, making the task of locating places to stay exceedingly simple. Communicating with the hosts was also  simple and convenient. Next trip, it's Airbnb all the way...

Version 1.2.2 2011-19-10 5
 (Thorough and intuitive) Kudos to the designers and app developers behind this one.  Super easy to set up my account and start browsing, all from my phone.  Excellent translation of the web version that nails all the key features.  Love it!

Version 1.2.2 2011-18-10 5
 (Great idea) I love AirBNB, I prefer the website to the app. It's great too

Version 1.2.2 2011-18-10 5
 (So easy!) It is amazingly easy to host. Reservations and billing are smooth. Thanks!

Version 1.2.2 2011-18-10 5
 (Very cool) Well done app and great idea

Version 1.1.2 2011-17-10 5
 (Host and traveler phene) Airbnb has changed my life. I absolutely adore it from the people who work there, the people who stay at my home and the hosts I meet when I travel! I use the app constantly and I love it! Helps me respond easier to people when I'm on my phone.

Version 1.2.2 2011-16-10 5
 (Convinient) With all the text messages. It's so convenient to know who is messages so I can reply much more quickly.

Version 1.2.2 2011-15-10 3
 (Need an iPad upgrade) We are heavy airbnb users and the app works great, but i want an iPad designed version.

Version 1.2.2 2011-14-10 4
 (Great app!) Easy to use! Excellent!

Version 1.1.2 2011-13-10 4

Version 1.2.2 2011-11-10 5
 (Love) I haven't used a home stay yet, but am currently looking at booking one and couldn't be more excited about the possibilities!

Version 1.2.2 2011-11-10 4
 (Poppin airbnb app) Love the airbnb App. It allows me to keep up with my property while on the go. It keeps my response rate at 100% because I'm only a fingertip away from being connected at all times. Love it! Love it! Love it! My only wish is that it had the same functionality as the website.

Version 1.2.2 2011-10-10 5
 (Super wonderful app!) Super wonderful app! Get it if you use Airbnb on the go!!!!

Version 1.2.2 2011-10-10 4
 (Airbnb) Love love love! Currently hosting and am looking forward to traveling to a unique airbnb location soon.

Version 1.2.2 2011-08-10 5
 (Awesome) I love this site! And the app is ok too :)

Version 1.2.2 2011-06-10 5
 (Great compliment) If you love Airbnb, you'll love the app even more. There are a couple host functions not available on the app compared to the website. Overall a great tool for both host and traveler.

Version 1.2.2 2011-03-10 5
 (Almost perfect app) The app is awesome. However, as a host I would like to see more of the dashboard integrated into the app. But other than that it's wonderful.

Version 1.2.2 2011-02-10 4
 (Convenient and useful) The AirBnB app keeps me connected with requests and reservations while I'm traveling. I wish it had the same functionality as the website, but it is very helpful, user friendly and convenient.

Version 1.2.2 2011-02-10 5
 (One smooth app) So well done.  All iOS apps should be this comprehensive. Excellent work.  Extremely easy to search and communicate with property owners.

Version v1.1.1 2011-29-09 5
 (So much better than hotel shopping!) A fantastic service.

Version 1.2.2 2011-26-09 5

Version 1.2.2 2011-21-09 5
 (Love the service and app) Will never book a hotel room if a room is available on AIRBNB

Version 1.2.2 2011-20-09 5
 (Fantastic People) I love sharing my home with the travelers using Airbnb! They are lovely people:)

Version 1.2.2 2011-19-09 5
 (Best app) This is a better way to rent a room then craigslist much more safe.

Version 1.2.2 2011-17-09 5
 ("A separate god for travelers") So I was sceptic, but I tried it out! I did put a lock on the closet but other than that I opened my home to a total stranger... and it was better than the subletting I have done off craigslist. Not necessarily better people but a shorter time. It's expensive to live in San Francisco, even more so because of the life I choose to live. Airbnb is a sheppard not only for me but travelers like me who are always moving. I agree if it's your once a year vacation maybe the risk is to high.... But I do believe there is a separate god for travelers so hit the road and come visit!! - m2

Version 1.2.2 2011-15-09 5
 (App is cool) I like the web interface more but the app is cool too, especially since the latest updates.

Version 1.2.2 2011-15-09 5
 (Must have app for any traveler!!) Get it now!

Version 1.2.2 2011-15-09 5
 (Awesome app) Love the service concept, haven't rented anywhere yet though. The app is beautiful

Version 1.2.1 2011-14-09 5
 (Elegant idea and function.) Both the service and the app are topnotch. Facilitates an equitable exchange between host and guest without hassle or exorbitant fees.

Version 1.2.1 2011-14-09 5
 (AirBnB is Amazing) I am excited and amazed by AirBnB's ease of access and available info. I had no idea there were so many private rentals in my area. This is my new (first stop) place to go if I'm looking for an amazing space for a short term vacation.. Totally impressed. Thank you, AIRBnB!

Version 1.2.2 2011-14-09 5
 (Easy and awesome) Having only used this app a few times I'm already convinced it is the way to travel. Great deals and real friendly people abound!

Version 1.2.2 2011-14-09 5
 (Easy) Just blown away at how easy it is to use this service and all of my bookings thus far have been very positive ...guests have been very thoughtful . Love Airbnb!

Version 1.2.1 2011-13-09 5
 (Great) Great app!

Version 1.2.1 2011-13-09 5
 (great app/idea for some extra $$) great idea for those heading out of town or in a relationship with two apartments. :)

Version 1.2.1 2011-13-09 4
 (Budapest) Seems to be a good lil app. Works smoothly for me, but I need an Ipad app too!!!! Thanks

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-09 5
 (Fantastic app and service) Not only is this app great, easy to use and really convenient for travellers, but the whole concept of airbnb is just fantastic. 

I use the app to manage an apartment i'm renting out and this app really comes in handy to communicate with guests immediately and accept and manage reservations. 

I've yet to use airbnb as a guest myself, but with features like the "help, i need a place to stay tonight" button, which finds available places around you immediately (i live in a remote town in Iceland where i tried it and got two hits!) i think that this service, along with the app, are absolutely essential for travellers, as well as hosts.

I might also add that the customer service is fantastic too. I think they might employ superheroes...

Version 1.2.1 2011-12-09 5
 (Great app!) Very well made app.

Version 1.2.1 2011-10-09 5
 (Great app!) Wonderfully intuitive.

Version 1.2.1 2011-08-09 5
 (Great) Very intuitive. Great user experience. Just loving it.

Version 1.2.1 2011-08-09 5
 (Awesome.) Was going to pay $180+ for a crappy 2-star hotel in Paris. I used airbnb instead and now I'm staying in a slick 1 bedroom apartment for $130 next to Arc Du Triumph (sp?)

Use this app. Use this service.

Version 1.2.1 2011-08-09 5
 (Mi amore!) As we're traveling through Italy, this amazing app is saving us! This app couldn't get any better!! Thx airbnb!

Version 1.2.1 2011-08-09 5
 (Great tool for hosts on the go!) Very helpful for hosts on the go to reply to potential guests promptly!

Version 1.2.1 2011-07-09 5
 (Travel!) Great app for travelers

Version 1.2.1 2011-06-09 5
 (Great app for travelers!) This is a great app for anyone wanting to stay in something besides a hotel. Whether your budget is great or small AirBnB has the spot for you!

Version 1.2.1 2011-06-09 5
 (Great new site) This is great!

Version 1.2.1 2011-05-09 4
 (Nice app!!!!) I like it a lot

Version 1.2.1 2011-05-09 4
 (Very useful app) This is a great app for a great service. However, as a host, I do wish you could access your calendar and adjust settings for your bookings via the app. 

Otherwise very useful.

Version 1.2.1 2011-04-09 5
 (Love Everything About Airbnb) The app, the staff & support, the places I've stayed, the people I've stayed with are all top notch!

Version 1.2.1 2011-04-09 5
 (Great App) A very helpful and easy to use alternative to their great website.

Version 1.2.1 2011-31-08 5
 (Great idea!) I used the site twice on my last trip (Spain). Definitely using it again. Keep it up!

Version 1.2.1 2011-31-08 5
 (Great) Smart, good working app.

Version 1.2.1 2011-29-08 4
 (Great idea!!) App still needs work but I'm super glad I found AirBnB.

Version v1.1.1 2011-28-08 5
 (WOW) What an App

Version 1.2.1 2011-26-08 2
 (Excellent service, annoying app) Requiring a login almost every 5 minutes makes the app very inconvenient to use. It doesn't even store the username!

Version 1.2.1 2011-26-08 3
 (Crashes quite a bit and can be slow) This is a rating for the app not the Airbnb service (which I love). The app is a bit buggy in it's current form -- it often crashes on me too.  When it is working, it's great and is a great augmentation to their website.  If they can get it more stable, it'll be 5 stars.

Version 1.2.1 2011-26-08 5
 (Simple, well-designed app.) Easy to use, great pictures, search results are sorted nicely.  I found a number of good possibilities... The biggest challenge was picking between the options of where to stay!

Version 1.2.1 2011-24-08 5
 (airbnb) Sooooooo glad I got an app! A solution to my photo submit problem! Yeah!!!!

Version 1.2 2011-24-08 5
 (Love!!) Great app

Version 1.2.1 2011-24-08 5
 (Love the App. Love AirBNB.) AirBNB is now an option on the same level as hotels. I have used it on several occasions and have had great great experiences. I also recommended it to my neighbors and they loved it. Stay at Coyote Ridge Ranch in Los Olivos, CA and you will understand why!!!

Version 1.2.1 2011-24-08 5
 (Excelent!!!) Very nice apartments!

Version 1.2.1 2011-24-08 4
 (Great app needs a few more features) Add some sharing features and make an iPad version!  Otherwise great stuff

Version 1.2.1 2011-22-08 5
 (Love!!) Amazing app! Amazing site. I just got back from my vacation and we stayed at an airbnb place. The place was even better than in pictures. Will definitely use this site again.

Version 1.1.2 2011-21-08 5
 (Amazing app) Easy to navigate and contains most of the website features! My favorite part is the ability to contact 24 7 support in one click.

Version 1.2.1 2011-21-08 5
 (Awesome!) Lovely app. Everyone should download it!

Version 1.2.1 2011-21-08 2
 (Needs work) Could not find a way to share a link to a property.

Version 1.2.1 2011-21-08 5
 (Perfect!) This is the only app I've seen that actually works BETTER than the website! Love it!

Version 1.2.1 2011-20-08 5
 (Awesome) One of the best apps. It's clean and easy to read, intuitive and never crashes. I love airbnb and they slam dunked with their app

Version 1.2.1 2011-20-08 4
 (Fantastic for on the go people like me) Just started using the app and it's fantastic for getting and sending messages fast. Love it!

Version 1.2.1 2011-20-08 1
 (Still doesn't work on 3GS) For some reason every-time this app launches it crashes in seconds? Please fix this, I would love to use it.

Version 1.2.1 2011-19-08 5
 (Great APP for a Great Service!!) .

Version 1.2 2011-19-08 4
 (I love this app) Is so easy to use, make my hosting experience easier, I also can search for place for my future travel plan. The down part is the uploading sometimes doesn't work and I can't edit my listing. But other than that great!

Version 1.1.2 2011-19-08 5
 (Awesome) Great app u can save loads money booking with airbnb

Version 1.2 2011-19-08 5
 (Don't even hesitate, get this app!!!) Made my trip to NYC fantastic: I saved hundreds by staying at an apartment rather than those expensive hotels in Manhattan. The owner was super friendly, Ithis app!

Version 1.2 2011-18-08 5
 (Great!!) Very quick and informative, love it

Version 1.2 2011-18-08 5
 (Great app!) This app is as handy as the webpage. Really easy to use. Change the way I host and travel forever!

Version v1.1.1 2011-17-08 5
 (Love it!) Love it!!

Version 1.0 2011-16-08 5
 (Use the Profiles) Great place if you fill out your profiles and do reviews. Makes it better and safer for everyone. Don't inquire about a property unless you've filled out your airbnb profile. It's the best way to become a trusted part of this great community!

Version 1.1.0 2011-15-08 4
 (Good) It would be great for owners to change availability online

Version 1.2 2011-15-08 5
 (this app makes hosting so easy!) way better than if airbnb was just a webapp. get this and then stay in or rent out a cute place. Bon voyage!

Version 1.0.1 2011-15-08 5
 (Excellent and easy to use!) Super-useful app!  Have booked 3 places with this already. Great app, only doesn't let you write a review on the app -- that you have to do on a real computer.

Version 1.1.2 2011-14-08 5
 (I LOVE this amazing app) With help of this perfectly developed app. I stayed perfectly in Vienna and Paris)
Use AirBNB and you'll get a perfect vacation)

Version 1.2 2011-14-08 5
 (A must have!!) I LOVE this App. I can not stress this enough!  I tell all my friends who are going to be taking a trip to make sure and check Air BNB before booking anything.  I love to get out on mini vacations and always am trying to find cool places to stay in.  Air bnb makes this sooooooo easy.  Most of the time I sit on my iPad and plan where to go next based on who has a unique cool place in the area.  I went to Milwaukee two weeks ago stayed in a nice hotel condo had a great experience so now I'm planning on going to Nashville next weekend to stay in a sweet 100 year old loft on 2nd street that is right in the middle of all the cool bars!   If I ever became a world traveler I would only use Air BNB to find private homes to stay in the deals you find can't be matched from any hotel!  I could go on for ever but then you would fall asleep and forget to download this App. DOWNLOAD IT! :-)

Version 1.1.2 2011-14-08 4
 (Great app for finding unique places to stay.) I had trouble reaching my host at one point, and the customer service was very good as well.

Version v1.1.1 2011-14-08 5
 (Love) Airbnb is the next, or IS the next big thing for travelers!  I love it!!

Version 1.1.0 2011-13-08 5
 (Fantastic!) Excellent app and service!

Version 1.2 2011-13-08 2
 (Good idea, not there yet) This site is a great idea, right in the pocket between couch surfing and TripAdvisor. Sadly it's not going to work until the hosts provide direct contact info like a phone number.

I tried to use it on a recent trip to Italy but the hosts didn't check email or get notified in a timely manner, and what should have taken hours took days, or never happened at all. I went back to TripAdvisor.

AirBnB might work if you're planning WAY in advance. Please consider adding phone #s.

Version 1.2 2011-13-08 1
 (Not Functional on iPhone 3G) After the first time you load it, the app stops being able to start on my iPhone 3G. Please fix this!

Version 1.2 2011-12-08 3
 (nice) the app design is nice but i found two major usability issues in 5 minutes: unable to set maximum price under 75 USD and unable to filter by wifi availability.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-08 5
 (Airbnb rocks.) Love airbnb great app and site for travelers.

 (What's not to love!!! Best app and business EVER!!!) As an AirBnB host this app is in invaluable!!! We're so busy hosting that we haven't gotten to use it to travel ourselves. But I day dream about traveling while perusing the featured properties while showing of the app to nearly everyone I meet or see who hasn't already heard of AirBnB! You'll be hooked once you try traveling or hosting through AirBnB!

Version 1.2 2011-09-08 2
 (Doesn't load on my iPhone 3G) I am unable to load this app on my iPhone 3G. It shuts down everytime I open this app. Seems to work perfectly fine on iPhone 4.

Version v1.1.1 2011-09-08 5
 (Great) The app sends the perfect level of reminders and helps you manage a property or room for rent with ease from anywhere your phone works.  The service in general is a pretty brilliant way to travel, I can't wait for my next airbnb vacation.

Version 1.2 2011-08-08 3
 (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE) Please don't stop my music when I launch it!
Great app btw

Version 1.2 2011-07-08 2
 (The app works but the concept doesn't) This app runs fine--although you cannot modify your profile from the app so you will have to log into a computer at some point before booking--but after trying twice to get a room with this service i gave up. People don't reply! I wasted a lot of time with this. Not recommended.

Version 1.1.2 2011-05-08 5
 (Awesome app) This app has made my travel life so much easier!!! LOVE it!!!

Version 1.2 2011-03-08 4
 (Great site and great app!) Great site and great app!

Version 1.2 2011-03-08 4
 (Nothing but great experience) Used air bnb for the first time. Booked room and everything was awesome! Saved a bundle over staying at a hotel!

Version 1.2 2011-03-08 5
 (Love airBNB) Love the service!  It's a fun and affordable way to travel!

Version 1.2 2011-03-08 5
 (Excellent app) Airbnb applied the same user friendliness for the design of this app as on their website. Good job!

Version 1.2 2011-02-08 5
 (Beautiful, Inspiring & Valuable!) I'm very impressed with Airbnb- even if I was only considering it for a money-saving travel-lodging finder.. It has some unbelievable prices for amazing properties all over the world. Truly caters to travelers of any size budget and has beautiful photos and some well-done videos showcasing various properties. Must say I'm very impressed, especially for a FREE app! Thanks for the great work you've obviously put into making the app so visually and monetarily appealing!

Version 1.2 2011-02-08 4
 (A few little fixes, but overall great!) Recently discovered this app after looking to quickly book a stay in NY. After making several inquires, I heard back immediately from one person via a push notification and was instantly sending messages back and forth to book my stay. It was so easy! 

My only complaint would be that it does crash when jumping between different windows in the app, but is easy to open back up as it remembers your login info. I would also like to see a way to delete your messages or inquiries within the mobile app. Once I've booked a place to stay its annoying to receive notifications from other contacts who think you're still looking for a room. Please fix. Thanks.

Version 1.2 2011-01-08 5
 (Incredibly Cool and Inspiring) I never leave reviews but had to on this one... Incredible app, great opportunities out there for travel I would have never known about otherwise... I might go on vacation, choosing the destination first via this app.

Version 1.2 2011-23-07 5
 (Great!) This is one of the best designed apps I have. I don't use it very often, but when I do it's a pleasure. Would love to have it on my iPad!

Version 1.2 2011-23-07 5
 (Awesome App!!) I love how easy it is to use and be able to information with others on the spot.  

One improvement I would like to see have done.  Is to make my scheduling calendar available on this app.  So I can update my calendar for guests.

Thanks
Gilbert

Version 1.1.0 2011-23-07 4
 (Use it alot) Awesome concept. So glad there's an AirBnB app now. Search by map, by dates, privacy & price. Can't search by amenities yet. I'd give it 5 stars except it crashes quite a bit.

Version 1.2 2011-22-07 4
 (Ipad) Ipad version??

Version 1.2 2011-18-07 5
 (Great App, so easy to use) Easy to use and fun to explore cheap ways of staying in great cities!

Version v1.1.1 2011-17-07 1
 (Crashes constantly. 24 out 25 attempts to open.) Seriously, I cannot even use it. I've reset and restarted my phone. Nothing. It just tries to load and crashes, again and again. Worthless.

Version 1.1.2 2011-17-07 5
 (Excellent app) Superb design and great functionality.

Version 1.2 2011-17-07 5
 (So awesome) But add save scroll position

Version 1.1.2 2011-16-07 5
 (Fab, Simply Fabulous) I joined Airbnb at the end of May and downloaded this app. My place has been booked every day since. This app is magnificent . I can respond immediately to an inquiry and send a special offer and ......bingo my place is booked no matter where I am. I can't say enough wonderful things about Airbnb and their app. Thank You so much for the business .

 (Love the app) Great app

Version 1.1.2 2011-15-07 5
 (Best App in the Store) Seriously, love this app. I would point out the negatives if there were any, but there aren't. Keep up the great work Airbnb!

Version 1.1.2 2011-15-07 4
 (Very Impressed) I only gave it 4 stars because I just downloaded it an I only browsed it, I haven't booked any places yet. I'm very impressed with it an surprised that it's a free app. When I actually book a place an see for myself if the process is quick an seemless I'll definitely up my rating to a full 5 stars. I really like this app and 4 stars just for viewing it should be taken as a compliment for the developers, keep up the good work!

Version 1.1.2 2011-15-07 5
 (Excelente aplicativo!) Muito bom em todos aspectos!

Version 1.1.2 2011-14-07 4
 (Works great, but needs profile improvement) It sometimes crashes but for the most part it's great. Love the alerts. I wish the email dashboard didn't require so many back buttons.

Version 1.1.2 2011-14-07 5
 (Airbnb is the best way to travel and meet travellers.) When I first used Airbnb, I wasn't expecting much. I booked a room in New York as a first time visitor and it was really, really worth it. Most hotels are $150 for a decent place. I loved my hosts and really got to know about New York. I didn't feel like a sheltered tourist!

Airbnb is extremely organized. As I rented my place, the photographer was exactly on time. The pictures were professional and I was pleased. More people should know about Airbnb!

Version 1.1.2 2011-14-07 1
 (Won't open on my iPod touch) I'm getting notifications, but the app won't open—it crashes before I see anything.

Version 1.1.2 2011-14-07 5
 (We love airbnb!) It sure is easy to book
Guests for our cottage! Haven't used it yet for travel, but hoping to real soon. Airbnb takes the hassle out of booking & has given us great access to an incredible caliber of guest! Thanks so much! The McGarrys

Version 1.1.2 2011-13-07 5
 (Great app) This app is great as is the service!

 (Nice app) Now it was easier to find a place to stay for holiday..

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-07 5
 (iPad) An iPad version would be nice.

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-07 5
 (Sweet) Sweet! Beats snotty hotel personnel!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-07 5
 (Add spice to life) I put my guest room up for rent and in less than 24 hours, I had a reservation pending. He left yesterday and another arrives today. I am paying my rent with 15 days of guest. Then I stay for free.

Version 1.1.2 2011-10-07 5
 (Love airbnb app!) Love love love the Airbnb app. Today while I was hiking I received a message that someone wanted to rent my cottage. What a great app!

Version 1.1.2 2011-09-07 5
 (Awesome App for Awesome Org) I only wish the distances were included in the listings, i.e. From where you will be spending most of your time.

Version 1.1.2 2011-09-07 5
 (Love this app) I usually don't write reviews which I know I should start because it tells people what's good and not but this app is amazing i love everything about it thank you dev for this great app.

Version v1.1.1 2011-08-07 5
 (Love love love it!) Great app for a fabulous way to travel!

Version 1.1.2 2011-08-07 5
 (Love Airbnb!) I loved the website and this company and now I love this app! A must-have for people who travel, want to travel, have a space to rent out, or just like to daydream about traveling!

Version 1.1.2 2011-08-07 5
 (Must for travelers) Amazing app to find places all over the wold And not stay on hotel rooms, find condos, rooms and communicate directly with the owner, the map is great to browse.

Version 1.1.2 2011-06-07 5
 (Great!) One of my favorite apps!

Version 1.1.2 2011-06-07 5
 (Dope) Comprehensive. Intuitive interface. Shock full of features but I never feel lost in the app. Lovely little creative details - someone spent a lot of time and care making this app and it really shows. I wish it let's me look and manage my calendar - but hey, for what's it's worth this thing is already A+ .. Fitting for A+ company like airbnb.

Version 1.1.2 2011-06-07 5
 (Saved our holiday! Truly a must-have app.) If you travel even a little, you must have this app. Well done! It should come pre installed on every phone.

Version 1.1.2 2011-06-07 5
 (The best experince ever) Search, find, choose, book, pay: all using the app. Best part? One amazing week at the heart of Paris with my wife. Can't wait the next trip.

Version 1.1.2 2011-04-07 1
 (Constant crashing?) I was so excites to have this site in app form. It worked once and now only crashes. I've tried everything. Please fix!!

Version 1.1.2 2011-04-07 5
 (Airbnb is fantastic!) Airbnb is one of the best companies I know of. I use their service regularly to travel and host two listings. In many respects, this app is the flagship of their operation as it offers everything you need to book, list and manage listings in real time. They make very effective use of the push server. I highly recommend Airbnb as a service, particularly in conjunction with this app.

Version 1.1.2 2011-04-07 5
 (Best app in the app store!) This is the best designed, most stable and reliable app available. The airbnb service is obviously amazing in its own right, but since this is an app review, I won't get into that. Hands down, every app designer could learn something from this app.

Version 1.1.2 2011-04-07 5
 (First Class) This app is great. It's going to make travel on the fly and more so, adventure travel easy. I love staying in guest houses vs hotels when possible and this app is the place to find them. From high-end to low, it has them all.

Version v1.1.1 2011-04-07 5
 (Awesome app!) So easy and quick to use... Trimmed down version of the site

Version 1.1.2 2011-03-07 4
 (Great app!) Thank you making it all so easy. I really like it!

Version 1.1.2 2011-02-07 5
 (Ingenious!) I just love how the entire business model works together.

Version 1.1.2 2011-01-07 5
 (Great App!!) We use airbnb to rent rooms when we travel and we also rent out our guest room to travelers. This app lets us stay on top of our reservations, check our messages and search for rooms!

I cant imagine how it could be better. I highly recommend it to any airbnb user!

Version 1.1.2 2011-01-07 5
 (Great!) Very useful if you use airbnb.

Version v1.1.1 2011-30-06 4
 (App is good, Results are GREAT!) What matters is having real alternatives to $100/night lodging, despite knowing the whole wing is vacant at your hotels.

Version 1.1.2 2011-30-06 5
 (Amazing app!!) I loved it!

Version 1.1.2 2011-29-06 4
 (Fun but needs some technical improvements) I love this app.  

However, if the programmers are reading this, please work on improving the app. 

There should be a way to clear the main screen when your done with games, maybe a vault.

There should be a game rules page.

There should be a way to cancel a game you didn't mean to start.

Thanks

Version 1.1.2 2011-28-06 5
 (Love the service and the app) Amazing.

Version 1.1.2 2011-28-06 3
 (Love Airbnb, but this app...) Great service, but the app crashes frequently on my iPhone 4. Also had to uninstall and reinstall the app after I couldn't log into my account.

Version 1.1.2 2011-27-06 5
 (Super!) I rented out my apartment in no time. Thumbs up!

Version 1.1.2 2011-25-06 5
 (Love it) Very easy to use. Love it!

Version 1.1.2 2011-24-06 4
 (Truly innovative) Well done. I would like to be able to search the map with activities/interests features (Fishing, festivals, music production rooms, wood working rooms, etc). 5 stars for that feature.

Version 1.1.2 2011-23-06 5
 (Loved Airbrn) It's so much easier than getting a hotel plus u get to meet new faces !!! :)

Version v1.1.1 2011-21-06 5
 (Perfection) used this app for a trip to Barcelona!  Found a fantastic flat in a brilliant location (safe, quiet, but near EVERYTHING).  Inquired and booked all through the app!  very smooth transaction and experience..all the way through!  I highly recommend both app and service!  i may never book a hotel again! :-)

Version 1.1.2 2011-21-06 5
 (Awesome) Love it!  Was perfect for our trip to the Bay.  Will use it again and again!

Version 1.1.2 2011-20-06 4
 (Love it!) Just joined but I already love it! Great destinations. Excellent website & resource for travel. The guys that created this are geniuses!

Version v1.1.1 2011-18-06 5
 (Hotel schmotel) If you love to travel but hate being a tourist air bnb is the way to go.  You get to experience cities in a much more intimate way when you're in an actual residence instead of some hotel. And, the beautiful bonus is that it's astonishingly less expensive than even a mediocre motel.

Version 1.1.2 2011-17-06 5
 (Great app!) Saved me so much money on my vacation, and turned out to be a much better experience than if I had stayed in a hotel. Now I'm just waiting for an iPad app.

 (Fantastic) A fantastic app for a phenomenal service.

Version v1.1.1 2011-16-06 5
 (Wow) What an amazing find!

Version v1.1.1 2011-15-06 5
 (Brilliant APP) For trying to independently rent out a room or find a room!

Version v1.1.1 2011-15-06 2
 (Great app until you need to search) Try searching for a new town or changing the filter.  Be prepared to wait 20+ seconds with no feedback.  Scrolling in the search list is jumpy too.

Version 1.1.0 2011-14-06 5
 (Airbnb is the BEST!) Planning an impromptu vacation this year has been great fun & very easy with this app!!

Version v1.1.1 2011-12-06 5
 (Awesome concept) Haven't used it yet, but I can't wait! As someone who loves home hospitality, and HATES cheap hotels, I love this idea! Especially like the "need a place to stay tonight" option.

Version v1.1.1 2011-12-06 5
 (Whoa) Fun little app! :)

Version v1.1.1 2011-11-06 4
 (Quite good) Great app overall. I especially appreciate how easily it saves specific searches. One major improvement would be if you could save apartments that you're interested in and/or omit those you don't care for.

Version v1.1.1 2011-11-06 5
 (Tasteful app) Very well done and easy to use.

Version v1.1.1 2011-11-06 5
 (Awesome!) Just relocated to a new city...I will use Airbnb until I find a permanent place

The app is easy to use and awesome when traveling because you can easily contact the hosts and find places quickly. So much fun to just browse as well. if you need a place to stay this is the site to find it!

Version v1.1.1 2011-07-06 5

 (Was a hidden gem) This is what I have been looking for a long time when I travel. Thank you for developing such an awesome product.

Version v1.1.1 2011-02-06 5
 (fantastic...when you're logged in) easy to use and well-designed app that allows easy access to all the functionality of airbnb. good integration with maps and phone.

the only real downside is that there is no way to permanently save your login information, and you are prompted for it to access any part of the app, including things like searching, which should be available even when logged out.

Version v1.1.1 2011-01-06 5
 (Life's just easier with AirBnB!) Thx for the FREE "Hollywood Photoshoot"! It brought out the natural beauty of my home.

Version v1.1.1 2011-01-06 5

 (Use it, love it, swear by it!) This has made traveling so much more efficient and enjoyable. Whether I plan a trip in advance or last minute, I can always find a nice, friendly, and affordable place. I appreciate the reviews and suggestions other travelers post and have had wonderful experiences using air bnb ;) 

In essence, I use it, love it, swear by it, and would recommend it to anyone. Literally, you can find something great for whatever location or price range you're searching for ;)

Version v1.1.1 2011-23-05 5
 (Thank god for the app!) This app makes my life with posting and responding to my request so much easier. I don't have to wait until I get back to my computer to search or review request. I am very happy they made it easy to use and easy to access now.

Version v1.1.1 2011-21-05 5
 (Much love to the AirBnB team!) Love the app! Well designed, great experience, and full featured!

Would love to see the ability to alter reservations, maybe by clicking the calendar graphics?  Either way, great mobile application!

Version v1.1.1 2011-20-05 5
 (Beautiful app for an even better service) Nothing but love for this outstanding app!

Version v1.1.1 2011-19-05 5
 (My first five star review) I rarely, in fact I can recall giving five stars in recent history. However, the app is top notch. It is real time, accurate, reliable, and completely replaces the need to visiting the main website almost entirely. 
If you want a first class app, this is the one. 
Thanks,
Reeds Vista

Version v1.1.1 2011-19-05 5
 (One of the best designed, most useful apps I've installed) Get it, it's beautiful and works great. You'll likely find yourself dreaming about options for your next getaway.

 (Good but could be a lot better) Good, handy app to have IF ONLY it were faster. It took forever to load a profile & pictures! Fact that you can email owner thru the app was very convenient. It would be totally handy if you could star or mark your favorite properties for your own personal reference for next time's trip.

Version v1.1.1 2011-15-05 5
 (Such a great App) My girlfriend gets mad cause I get so consumed in this app finding cool rooms and exploring what's out there. Well done!

Version 1.0.1 2011-14-05 5

 (Awesome!) This app is a fantastic way to travel and host others while you are away. Doesn't hurt that it puts a little in your wallet either.

Version v1.1.1 2011-09-05 5
 (awesome) and wonderfully addictive!!!

Version v1.1.1 2011-07-05 5
 (One of the best UX apps) Perfect for a disruptive startup.

Version 1.1.0 2011-07-05 5
 (Fantastic app and service!) I'd recommend Airbnb to anyone who has an extra bed or who travels even sparingly -- it's a great experience and great for hosting and traveling!

Version v1.1.1 2011-06-05 5
 (Love it!!!) As a host and as a tourist, easy to use and very helpful

Version v1.1.1 2011-30-04 4
 (Great App) Solid application. What's missing is a "sort" function for prices & distance from location. Also, it would be nice to be able to mark certain places as favorites, or at least save places.

Version v1.1.1 2011-30-04 5
 (easy to use) couch surfing for adults... real quality app.

Version v1.1.1 2011-29-04 5
 (AirBnB) Great, focused app that serves me well when I'm traveling, but also provides some host services too.

Version v1.1.1 2011-28-04 5
 (Lovin' airbnb) Love this app, love airbnb! Will always use airbnb when I travel.

Version v1.1.1 2011-27-04 5

 (Love the IPhone app..) Beats couch surfing..

Version v1.1.1 2011-22-04 5
 (Kicks Butt!!!) I found Airbnb through a friend and it is the coolest an best site around! Listed my place and within weeks I already had 2 parties booked. I recommend it to everyone!

Version v1.1.1 2011-22-04 5
 (One of my goto app design models) Well done

Version v1.1.1 2011-22-04 5

 (Awesome App) This app is a must have for the serious traveler or novice.

Version v1.1.1 2011-20-04 5
 (Killer app-saves my life) I am terrible with checking/responding to email & this app has converted me into an efficient, apartment-renting machine! Thanks, airbnb-you rock.

Version v1.1.1 2011-20-04 5
 (Super app) Very hip and convenient

Version v1.1.1 2011-19-04 5
 (Marty Vaz) Outstanding app! Cheers!

 (Perfect) Just need a post to twitter option.

Version v1.1.1 2011-16-04 5
 (Greatest app!!!) Great deals!!!

Version v1.1.1 2011-14-04 1
 (Crash, crash, crash on my 3G) It works until I sign in after a reinstall and then it crashes every time I try to open it.  Maybe it works with a newer Phone. Not with mine.

Version v1.1.1 2011-13-04 5
 (Airbnb = goodness) Used it or the first time last week.  So easy...referring to finding a place, communicating with the host, transacting through the app.  Saved my company a considerable amount of money vs. lodging in a hotel.

Version v1.1.1 2011-12-04 5
 (Love this service) Found a great apartment in Cartagena vs a hotel, best deal and the apartment was fantastic, better than the pics!

Version v1.1.1 2011-12-04 4
 (Airbnb Review) I have had a great experience with thia app so far.  It has actually never crashed for me and been helpful when the university PC's are taken or just running very slowly.  Maybe the way they have developed the application that makes it so solid.  I really like the graphics as it makes travel booking quite fun.  Looking forward to more features in future releases.

Version v1.1.1 2011-10-04 5
 (Airbnb app) As a host I use it repeatedly daily and no crashes to date. I love the format, the ease, the graphics so clear.

Version v1.1.1 2011-08-04 4
 (Cool app) I wish they have more property available. I <3 travel.

Version v1.1.1 2011-07-04 5
 (Great App) No crashes so far. Seems very well polished. Easy to search for places to stay for my next vacation. Very straightforward to look for places in the area, see pictures, contact the owner, and book the place.

Version v1.1.1 2011-05-04 4
 (Great idea and great app) I have read some other reviews about the app crashing, unfortunately, I can not confirm the instability of the app itself. It has been doing exactly what was advertised, which is always nice here in the app store. 

I was very surprised to find such quality listings internationally, which is where I hope to spend more time. 

Quick and easy to understand interface with some extras I would not have thought about, but were a def plus to the overall experience. 

Give it a try! You have nothing to lose, it's FREE! Who knows, you may just find some place, somewhere you have always wanted to go with insider's POV. (and that's what traveling is all about, IMHO)

Version v1.1.1 2011-05-04 5
 (Great) :-)

Version v1.1.1 2011-05-04 1
 (Too bad it crashes!) We are traveling in Spain and I was looking to using this app while traveling. It crashes every time.  I tried deleting and re-installing, but still doesn't work. It worked before we left. I hope there is a fix soon.

Version v1.1.1 2011-03-04 1
 (Crashes Every Time) As a host on airbnb I was really excited that there was a update.  I had hoped that the bugs were going to be worked out bacasue the last version crashed every time I tried to open it.  Well, guess what?  It still crashes.  I've tried uninstalling the app and reloading it several times and still have no luck.  This is really disappointing because my income depends on being able to get back to prospective guests very quickly.  I've given up on this app.  It's easier to use Safari.

Version v1.1.1 2011-01-04 2
 (Crashes :() It won't even open; I enjoy that actual website though.

Version v1.1.1 2011-01-04 5
 (Amazing) Airbnb has built an amazing app that seamlessly recreates the web experience. While on vacation I can book a place to stay, and rent my own all without ever carrying a laptop, genius.

Version v1.1.1 2011-01-04 4
 (Looks Great, Would Like A Fav Section) I haven't had a chance to use the app to book a stay somewhere, but it looks fantastic, and it's a great idea implemented. 

The only thing I thought was missing was a favorite's section. I see so many great places, but I'm not able to tag them to easily review them at a later date. If that was rectified, I'd easily give it 5 stars then.

Version v1.1.1 2011-31-03 1
 (Crashes every time) I am a host on Airbnb and need this app to respond to guests but the app won't even open without crashing.

Version v1.1.1 2011-31-03 5
 (Luv the app!!) Browsing the app just like traveling around the world@@

Version v1.1.1 2011-30-03 5
 (Love it) And love airbnb

Version v1.1.1 2011-29-03 5
 (Perfect travelling companion) Great App, Great UI and excelent content. 
Easy to use App for lodging

Version v1.1.1 2011-28-03 5
 (Seriously awesome!) I had no idea anything like this even existed. What a wonderfully easy app and overall idea!

Version v1.1.1 2011-27-03 5
 (The best way to travel and book.) The images and functionality are amazing! I can confirm guests from anywhere. I can also browse pictures at the airport waiting for flights :)

Version v1.1.1 2011-27-03 5
 (Just when you thought it couldn't get any better) Beautiful

Version v1.1.1 2011-26-03 2
 (It's ok) I only like looking at all the cool places that's the only reason I got it

Version 1.1.0 2011-26-03 5
 (STUNNNNNING!) This app is absolutely gorgeous. I can't believe how easy Airbnb has made booking an island! You can do it in one simple tap of a button from you iPhone! That's mind blowing. 

I'm looking forward to booking a trip with this app soon.

Version 1.1.0 2011-26-03 5
 (Awesome app!!!) This app is absolutely fantastic. Very handy if you travel a lot. Thank you guys!

Version 1.1.0 2011-23-03 5
 (Fantastic!) A very well done app that has saved me during my travels!

Version 1.1.0 2011-21-03 2
 (Update long overdue) Useful but reliable enough if you are a host with Airbnb !

Version 1.1.0 2011-21-03 5
 (Great app!) One of the most useful tools for traveling

Version 1.1.0 2011-20-03 1
 (Keeps crashing) I've redownloaded this app more than enough time and it keeps crashing. It wont even open the home page. It worked for a bit the first time and it was great. But now, it won't open at all.

Version 1.1.0 2011-19-03 5
 (Best app of 2011) Sometimes I look at the app just to dream about future trips, even while on vacation! Such an incredibly, well-made service and beautifully helpful app. I love airbnb!

Version 1.1.0 2011-19-03 5
 (Beautiful to look at AND use!) Great app, well designed. Images are beautiful, how can you not want to travel when you see this stuff?!?!! Nice job!

Version 1.1.0 2011-17-03 5
 (Super awesome!) Loving the app - makes the renting easy and no quick

Version 1.1.0 2011-16-03 5
 (Easy to use) Good UI, easy and quick search, good app

Version 1.1.0 2011-16-03 5
 (Love it) Hotels.com + Facebook + AwesomeSauce

Version 1.1.0 2011-13-03 5
 (Outstanding Landlord App!!!) A wonderful tool for us!! We use Airbnb to help us occupy our 20 properties in the Chicago area.  We offer short term corporate housing so our clients are generally never with us much longer then a month.  This app helps us tremendously with keeping track of our clientele, arrivals, departures, contact info and much more.  

This is much more than an app. It's an upstanding company to do business with!!

Kudos!!!

Version 1.1.0 2011-09-03 5
 (Worked perfectly for us.) My wife and I used this to travel up the California coast on our honeymoon. We stayed in two cities and one art community right outside a city. One of the stops was even on the fly and all of our housing accommodations exceeded expectation.  Thanks bnb!

Version 1.1.0 2011-07-03 3
 (Ok---but ....prices not reliable) The app itself seems to work well with no real issues. My concern is that using the app and the prices not being what's advertised. Ok with some mark up for hosting, but some (most in my case) sites were twice or more than shown on site. Ended up using priceline at last minute to secure a hotel. Over all concept is great, just need to have no bait and switch.

Update:
Finally used it and the location / accommodation were great!  Will be using again.

Version 1.1.0 2011-04-03 3
 (unwelcome surprise : -( creates a "listing" when you enter a zipcode) Likely a fishing scheme to get personal data on users.   I entered a zipcode in response to the prompt "see what your place is worth".    Soon I got email urging me to complete my "listing".    Then learned my "listing" expires after 24 hours unless I post a photo.   Deceptive practice at worst, lousy design at best.

Version 1.1.0 2011-26-02 3
 (Great for searching) Great for searching properties. Difficult to manage your own. Hard to find your bookings, etx. Is there even access to the calendar?

Version 1.1.0 2011-26-02 5
 (Great resource!) I've used AirBnB for traveling all over the world and love it. Their app is very useful, however I do wish they would show favorites (currently I can only see them on website).

Version 1.1.0 2011-26-02 5
 (Stunning.) App designers, take note - this is exemplary UX.

Version 1.1.0 2011-24-02 5
 (One of the best apps I've seen) Love it love it love it. Fresh, clean, intuitive. Kudos to Airbnb's mobile application development. Their website is also incredible. As a software engineer and working in hospitality this is the best project I've ever seen in this industry.

Version 1.1.0 2011-23-02 5
 (True Love) I have never fallen so hard or so fast for an app the way I have for airbnb! It's beautiful, well organized, easy to use, helpful in a pinch or for a planner...it's perfect - just like the idea and company itself :o)

Version 1.1.0 2011-19-02 4
 (Always asks login) There is a problem with auto login. Always prompts me to login with my credentials, doesn't save them on device.

Version 1.1.0 2011-19-02 5
 (Excellent App) Superb idea and app! Love it!

Version 1.1.0 2011-19-02 5
 (Rberrs83) I totally love it!

Version 1.1.0 2011-13-02 5
 (Gorgeous) Jaw-dropping.

Version 1.1.0 2011-12-02 5
 (Great app) Stylish, informative, and fun to browse

Version 1.1.0 2011-11-02 5
 (Love it!) I love airbnb app as well as the website. I have used airbnb to book getaways 3 times and the next trip is scheduled for April. Airbnb app is on of the best, design and interface are great! Sometimes I just used it cheer myself up or search for a new design ideas for my home.

Version 1.1.0 2011-08-02 4
 (i feel lovestruck) i love like a classmate in my class

Version 1.1.0 2011-07-02 5
 (AirBnB Host) Awesome site great for doing airbnb business while on the go!

Version 1.1.0 2011-06-02 5
 (very user friendly) good interface n very user friendly.

Version 1.1.0 2011-06-02 5
 (Smooth app that works better than the actual website!) Airbnb.com is a great service.  I've used it to stay in Paris and Austin, with great results.  Now, they've put this app out, and unbelievably, it works more smoothly than their own website.

I'm planning my next trip to Europe entirely from my iPhone.  Pretty amazed!

Have fun!

Version 1.1.0 2011-06-02 5
 (Great!) That's all I have to say

Version 1.1.0 2011-04-02 5
 (Perfect) This app is so easy and convenient, it's perfect for a traveller!!

Version 1.1.0 2011-02-02 4
 (Fantastic!) Great application if you are not in front of the computer all day! Freezes sometimes but then it goes back and keeps working!

Version 1.1.0 2011-01-02 5
 (Great app) This is a great app. I travel a lot and use it to search for properties instead if hotels.

Version 1.1.0 2011-31-01 1
 (Teaser) Looked amazing until the app froze on a description page leaving  no way to exit out. Could be such a perfect app if it were functional.

Version 1.1.0 2011-30-01 5
 (97% great...but...) I wish the 'upcoming' button is more of a visual calendar (more like the calendar on the website) rather than a list.  As a host, I like to see how full or empty things are throughout the months...

Otherwise:  great looking app and very easy to use design...

Version 1.1.0 2011-30-01 4
 (Beautifully designed app) Love the fit & finish on this app.  Little bit of lag in syncing between the web and the app knocked off a star.

Version 1.1.0 2011-28-01 1
 (Airbnb App isn't working) The app continues to crash upon launch. Pls fix asap!

Version 1.1.0 2011-28-01 2
 (Nice when it's not crashing :() I have an iPhone 3G running latest iOS4. After the first install I can use the app once, but after that it's crashing at launch. I don't even get past the splash screen. Reinstalled several times and same result after every install.

Devs, please please please check the crash reports and fix, I wanna use this app! :(

Version 1.1.0 2011-27-01 5
 (Fantastic!) This app is amazing. Besides being able to access all of the fabulous listings on the site, the app is extremely functional for hosting. It makes renting your extra space that much easier. Airbnb, you're my favorite!

Version 1.1.0 2011-25-01 5
 (Amazing) I can't wait to use this app. I spend hours just looking at all the incredible places they offer. Great Job!

Version 1.1.0 2011-24-01 5
 (Brilliant!) Can't get enough of this app! The service is quite wonderful and let's me find amazing places to stay on the cheap. Great job!

Version 1.1.0 2011-23-01 4
 (Well designed app for a great service) I agree with everyone here who says that this is by far one of the best designed apps out there. The visual design is pleasant to look at not to mention that it's fun to look up properties around the country as well as the world for great (and often cheap) places to stay.

I recently discovered this service and now can't imagine staying at a hotel unless absolutely forced to do so.

The only gripe I have about this app is that you can't add properties you find on the mobile app to your online account. If they can implement that feature I think it would be close to perfect.  Even if you're not actually traveling, it's fun just to browse the different properties and daydream for a quick mental vacation.

Version 1.1.0 2011-22-01 5
 (Very interesting!) I loaded this app and it has suprisingly great deals and has a very easy to use interface. This app has potential.

 (This app will not open on my iPhone 3G) It opened once... After install.

Have not been able to open it since. Even tried removing and reinstalling... Same issue.

Version 1.1.0 2011-21-01 5
 (Wonderful) It is a great application you can find what you want by just 1 click

Version 1.1.0 2011-20-01 5
 (Great app!) Well designed way to find a great place to stay both stylishly, quickly, and cheaply.  A must have for travelers!

Version 1.1.0 2011-18-01 4
 (Vert practical) Airbnb can supply people who need an appropriate and comfortable apartment so much convenience.It’s really a practical app.

Version 1.1.0 2011-18-01 4
 (Lov it!) I love the app! Great the only thing is that you can't upload pictures.

Version 1.1.0 2011-17-01 1
 (Doesn't work on IPAD...) This apps says it work for IPhone, ITouch & IPad, but it will only download the tiny screen IPhone version to an IPad. Don't state it works on IPad when it doesn't. Pls make IPad version. Will change review & stars.

Version 1.1.0 2011-16-01 1
 (Ridiculously, non functionally unstable) This app is a joke. I was able to use it literally once. It looked awesome. Now it crashes chronically and does not even open. Completely non-functional. Developers should be fired.

Version 1.1.0 2011-15-01 5
 (Very simple, yet informative) It's so easy to use & it's so easy to search for places, I love the alerts it sends to0!

Version 1.1.0 2011-14-01 5
 (Clean interface, awesome functionality) Have come to expect no less than an amazing app for such a great service :)

Version 1.1.0 2011-12-01 5
 (Great app) Top quality for a top quality service

Version 1.1.0 2011-11-01 5
 (Great app) Very well designed, and easy to use. Very useful.

Version 1.1.0 2011-09-01 5
 (Great ideas) We are always looking for new, interesting places to go and this app/ service does just that.

Version 1.1.0 2011-08-01 4
 (Top top top) I'm impressed with the quality and all functionality of this app. The service is already awesome, so the app brings all you need to your pocket. 
The only issue is that I'm experiencing some bugs and crashes when checking search results.

Version 1.1.0 2011-06-01 5
 (Great news!!!!) I just learned about airbnb.  I hope everyone hears about it soon.
This is how I travel, and its the only way to go..
I listed my place, come visit!

Version 1.1.0 2011-06-01 5
 (A shining example) This is one of the few apps that made me step back and say "wow".
Disabling text notifications when push is enabled? They didn't have to do that, but the fact that they did shows an attention to detail and user experience that sets it apart from many services and applications out there.

Version 1.1.0 2011-06-01 4
 (Travel Help) I love travel very much, I think it is best app for travel.

Version 1.1.0 2011-04-01 5
 (:)) This app kept me a virgin.

Version 1.1.0 2011-03-01 4
 (Best travel idea) This site is amazing! I don't know if I'd ever hotel again..

Version 1.0.2 2010-27-12 1
 (Fix this!) I love airbnb but this app is useless. I can no longer even open it without it immediately crashing

Version 1.0.2 2010-21-12 1
 (Lousy App) I'm a big fan of the AirBnB service but this app is unusable.  I've reloaded it a dozen times and it won't work at all.

Version 1.1.0 2010-17-12 3
 (Fix Crashing!!!) I love this app but please fix all the crashing! The only thing I can do is log on and see the Featured page then it crashes every time.

Version 1.0.2 2010-11-12 5
 (Excellent app) I'm a fellow iOS developer, working with large clients.  This app is designed very well. Probably one of the best example on how a data-driven, B2B2C app should be built.  

I recommend this as both a developer and a user.  Thanks for the inspiration and great service.

Version 1.0.1 2010-08-12 5
 (Cool) Good place to reserve rooms.

Version 1.0.1 2010-02-12 5
 (Amazing) I think everyone that loves to travel download this app. It's awesome and I barely downloaded it. Can't wait to actually stay places that I book.

Version 1.0.1 2010-02-12 5
 (Who care about checkpoints!!!!!!!!!!) This app is great... And this is for submitting reviews about this app, NOT ANY OTHER APP.. F^^K check points and how that app is.. People who just go on the reviews to talk about other apps, there dumb post are garbage.. And it messes everything up. Get a damn advertising agent!!!!!

Version 1.0.1 2010-30-11 5
 (A classic) For one who seldom ventures from NYC, make that ventures beyond 40th & Lex, I must say I find this application quite enjoyable indeed.

Version 1.0.1 2010-30-11 3
 (Good idea) Just needs some fixes. Cannot search many specific locations but results show differently for "Current location" compared to city searches. Cannot adjust distance for nearby search results. Needs more filters such as amenities or type of rental.

Version 1.0.1 2010-29-11 2
 (won't load! crashes every time!) love airbnb.com and am active member, so i downloaded this app to manage my account, but i can't even open it! c'mon guys... please fix!

Version 1.0.1 2010-29-11 4
 (Convenience little app) I really enjoy using this app to book for places. The only thing I recommended is that it should added places in the filter section. :) But overall awesome app!!!

Version 1.0.1 2010-28-11 5
 (Well Made!) A beautifully well-made app! Perfect for frequent travelers!

Version 1.0.1 2010-26-11 5
 (Fantastic UI) Amazing incredible user interface.

Version 1.0.1 2010-26-11 4
 (Wonderful App!!!) Everything is so well done! I can plan my families vacation on the fly with this great looking app, that opens up to some of the most affordable and clean living spaces wherever you want to go!

Version 1.0.1 2010-25-11 4
 (Great app for daydreaming....) I love looking at the photos of all these places around the world. Who knew you could find a place in Paris so cheap?

Version 1.0.1 2010-25-11 4
 (Great app for a revolutionary platform) Have used Airbnb all throughout Europe and prefer it to hotels hands down. This app has been thoughtfully created and is a must have for globetrotters.

Version 1.0.1 2010-23-11 5
 (Amazing app) Awesome escapism fantasy, one day I will hopefully get to one of these AMAZING locations!

Version 1.0.1 2010-23-11 5
 (Great) I've used this on my last trip from the PC version.The site works and is great. I'm so happy this is now an app and it looks better then ever and easy to use.

Version 1.0 2010-22-11 5
 (Beautiful apps for amazing product) Easy to use and navigate, beautifully made. A must have for any traveller or AirBnB host. Also, let the app show you how you can earn cash on AirBnB even if you have never tried it!

Version 1.0.1 2010-22-11 3
 (Cool!!) Ok

Version 1.0.1 2010-22-11 5
 (Tired of Being Limited to Buying Only Free Apps?) If u want to buy other apps but don't have the money, download the free app "Checkpoints" and use the code "babbehmom" for sign-up and u can easilyyy get bunch of free gifts, such as $15-$30 iTunes giftcards

 (Simply Amazing!) Wow! There may not be words to accurately describe how great this app is! It does nearly everything one could need or want from a travel app, with the notable exception of not leaving mints on my guests' pillows. I've been using Airbnb from a blackberry with little success over the last couple of years and have had to call Airbnb to assist in confirming reservations when I was on the go, with this app, that's a thing of the past. I especially love how you can add new pictures to your property directly from my new iPhone.

As a faithful user I am so excited about the app and it is definitely going to encourage me to travel more. The daily deals are simply amazing and I can't wait to book one!

There are few truly lovable and memorable apps and Airbnb's ranks among them. This is the new standard!

 (easy to navigate and fun to browse) everything about this app is user friendly and i have spent quit a bit of time day dreaming about future trips.  my favorite feature of the airbnb app is the "collections" section.  the graphics are great, the layout is clever and the endless options keep me searching the app for ages.

Version 1.0.1 2010-22-11 4
 (Amazing!!) Why is this app having a big buzz. Wish I found it earlier. Starting to plan for next vacation. Only 4 stars because you can't save a property if you want to look at it for a later time or to compare.

Version 1.0.1 2010-21-11 4
 (Pretty good) I like this app, now affording the spots is a different story unless I wanna stay,on a boat!

Version 1.0.1 2010-21-11 5
 (Fun and Functional) Wow!  This app is phenomenal for cruising AirBNB.  The presentation is fun and colorful and makes browsing an enjoyable experience.  I found myself browsing through their special categories such as "I'm on a boat" (places on boats), "Trees & Zzzzs" (tree houses) and Ye Own Castle (Castles!) just for fun.  I like how reviews of the hosts are easy to find and pictures are easy to browse through thanks to the iPhones ability to scroll through pics with the swipe of a finger.  The best feature is the ability to let the app use my location (with permission) allowing me to see listings nearby integrated with googlemaps.  No need to type in my address, thus making the app faster and easier to use than via that standard website.  I was sitting at home doing this so it was interesting to see what was nearby but I could see this feature being ultra useful while traveling.  Everything just feels snappy and fast and of course the presentation is gorgeous.  For a product catered to the traveler it only makes sense to use the app!  5 stars for fun and function.

Version 1.0.1 2010-21-11 5
 (Great tool for a great service) I've used airbnb 5 times (3 as a traveler, 2 as a host).  The service is fantastic and this App is really the icing on the cake.  Incredible design and super easy to use (would you expect anything less from these guys?).  The App makes managing reservations so simple, and browsing for possible destination is a lot of fun with the high res images and destination groupings.

Hotels (especially in the US) are grossly overpriced and impersonal.  Airbnb is a much better way to travel.

Version 1.0.1 2010-21-11 5
 (Amazing!!!!) Wait... You can book an island from your phone???  UNREAL!

Version 1.0.1 2010-21-11 5
 (Amazing polish and refinement) Such a remarkably well-designed and beautiful application. Like the animated loading screen -- it's a screen that you'll only really see once when you load the application from a clean slate, but the fact that the designers put in the work to make that *single impression* speaks volumes of their attention to detail. The Airbnb app is full of these great little flourishes that just make the application so pleasant and fun to use.

Navigating the application and the various collections is easy on both the brain and the eyes. The wide photographs of the properties really pop on the iPhone's screen! It definitely provokes one's imagination...

Good job, guys!

Version 1.0.1 2010-21-11 5
 (Fantastic, easy to use, beautiful) In light of the amount of functionality the app has — and the amount of info it contains — it is really impressive that it is so simple use.  Well done!  And it is pretty.

Version 1.0.1 2010-21-11 5
 (A Beautiful app) A well laid out app. Nice job.

Version 1.0.1 2010-21-11 5
 (Loving it!) What can I say? This app is breathtaking. One can really tell AirBnb put a lot of work into the details here. Overall the app is very polished, the interface is slick, and most importantly gives me the urge to go travel!

As a host this app makes my life easier, as a user it makes it awesome!

Thanks AirBnB!

Version 1.0.1 2010-20-11 5
 (Sublime design) Look, I'm nowhere near booking an island, I can barely afford my apartment now lol, however the gorgeous design of the app makes it so visually appealing and irresistible to put down even if you aren't interested in booking anything. The categories, sections, and whole structure of the app is flawless, every single detail you need to find is there, pictures, contact info, it even gives you an estimate on your own place!! How cool is that? You had to bring a realtor in the old days and pay him money just to say those few valuable words. Airbnb should definitely be nominated for app of the year! 10/10

Version 1.0.1 2010-20-11 1
 (New update unstable) Just updated the app and can no longer use the filter. After using it for 5 minutes or so it crashes and I have to delete and re-install it to get it to work.

Version 1.0 2010-17-11 5
 (Awesome A+++++) I wish I had this app 2weeks ago before I visited New York. Great app, will give 10 stars for it.

Version 1.0 2010-16-11 5
 (Wow!) The browsing experience on the Airbnb iphone app is incredible & the daily deals grab you instantly. Perusing this app becomes addictive -- it's hard keeping myself in my office chair rather than jumping on a plane asap to one of the exotic destinations offered!

Version 1.0 2010-15-11 5
 (Beautiful and easy to use) This is probably the most beautiful and easy to use app I've ever seen! 
My personal favorite are the collections. They have so many wonderful and unique places!
Also check out "what's my place worth?".

Version 1.0 2010-15-11 5
 (Wherever you are...airbnb comes with you.) This is the best app for a globetrotter. Fire up and book awesome spots. Say goodbye to the incessant spam advertising of other travel sites and relax. I Love it!

Version 1.0 2010-15-11 5
 (Awesome) Such a great app to see amazing places around the globe.  My family and I can now make vacation planning fun and pick a place to sleep before we choose a location. Easy to use and organized beautifully.

Version 1.0 2010-15-11 5
 (Awesome) I traveled to Sonoma this weekend and stayed at an Airbnb apartment.  The app made my life so much easier!  I got into my dashboard and was able to call my host directly from my phone without having to sort through my emails.  The daily deals are unbelievable and the interface is awesome.  Can't wait to use it as a host too!

Version 1.0 2010-15-11 5
 (Visually Stunning) What a great little app!  The interface is very simple, easy to navigate, and provides a tremendous amount of useful information.  I especially like the geo-location feature that allows you to find places closest to where you are at any given moment.

All in all, this is a fantastic supplement to the website and I plan to make good use of it.

Version 1.0 2010-15-11 5
 (Phenomenal!) Gorgeous design, excellent UI. Looking through the amazing variety of properties gives me serious wanderlust. I'm impressed with the last minute lodging feature, as well as the easy-to-post capability for listing a place. Now you can monetize your place while you travel, so your apartment essentially pays for itself.

Version 1.0 2010-15-11 5
 (Fantastic) Airbnb is the best way to travel and now I can look up locations on my iPod and iPhone!  It is divine!  If you love to travel and love to save money, this is the app for you!

Version 1.0 2010-14-11 5
 (Love it) Great design bamn in your face big hotel!!!!!!

Version 1.0 2010-14-11 5
 (Instant Airbnb Fan) Beautiful work on this app. Super easy to use, even for someone less tech savvy like me. It's almost easier than the actual site, and I'm a big fan of both. The only thing I miss is the Search by Distance option (didn't see it on the app). Excited to get all the updates to come. Thanks Airbnb!

Version 1.0 2010-14-11 5
 (Wow, one of the most impressive apps I have seen) This app is really something else, the attention to design and UI detail is unlike anything I have seen before.  I literally fell asleep travel dreaming through collections last night.  Nice work Airbnb.

Version 1.0 2010-13-11 5
 (Totally rocks) Great way to manage my airbnb. Totally awesome great job guys. Love how I can manage my requests, send messages, and see who is checking in next.

Version 1.0 2010-13-11 4
 (Programming Glitches) Excellent overall app, but some behind the scene programming glitches when pulling info from Airbnb Host's web accounts/listings to appear in app listings: gramatical errors in imposed titles & bed size info is left blank if web account host originally chose "other" from drop-down menu, then typed in "queen" or "king" size bed. Not a smooth transition from Host's web ad info to app info. Hopefully Airbnb will correct this soon. Otherwise, I love this app!

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 5
 (Great app for a great service!) As if airbnb wasn't cool enough on its own, they've now got one of the slickest apps I've seen in a while! Nothing short of amazing for a v1.0

Now I just need an app to give me more vacation days!!!

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 5
 (Gorgeous and fun to use!) This is a great and all-around well designed app. What was once a painful process of trying to find a place quickly on-the-go is now a fun and easy experience. The deal of the day and what's my place worth are awesome features I'll be checking out even when I'm grounded. Makes it dangerously easy to get lost daydreaming amongst the featured property listings!

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 5
 (Fantastic app) This app is really well done. If the "Deals of the Day" continue to be this good (first one was a private island for $100/night), I'll be sure to use the app once a day. I also think the "Find a Place Tonight" feature could be quite handy. Anyways, I recommend you check out the app.

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 5
 (Incredible!) This app is just another extension of the solid design and upkeep that is the airbnb website. I can't imagine all the work that went into this, and the fact that they have SO many properties listed in so many amazing locations is clearly showcased. I'm excited about this new app on a practical level, as an occasional traveler, and also on a totally fanciful wannabe-nomad level. 'Cause watch out! This could ignite some serious wanderlust.

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 3
 (Ambitious but Crashed for me) Nice service but app crashed when I tried to login. Ambitious v1 launch with lots of features.

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 5
 (A Window To The World) I've never used such an engrossing app that really inspires the senses.  This is so fun to use that you end up just browsing at all the various places that you could stay around the world and you can find some real bargains.  What's cool is that you can find places that are around you that are available.  What's even cooler is you can find out how much YOUR place is worth!  Now I check out how much my friend's places are worth!

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 5
 (Sleek, entertaining and it works!) This new Airbnb App is fun to browse and gives me the full Web experience and more. It's entertaining to search and find awesome places to go and then to book them right from my iPhone is amazing.  Super useful and sleek!

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 5
 (Awesome app) Awesome app making an awesome site that much better. Just need to make an iPad version. Keep it up joe

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 5
 (I like giraffes.) Great app! Fun to browse the listings, even if you are not planning a trip. I only wish that I could bookmark my favorites for a vacation in the distant future, like I can on the Airbnb website (which is great, by the way!). Not a huge issue though, as it would be pretty hard to forget about a property like Giraffe Manor in Kenya where you can breakfast with giraffes outside the kitchen window. Awesome!!!

Version 1.0 2010-12-11 5
 (Best looking app ever) Wanted to use AirBnB more. Maybe this app will let my company agree to let me expense and use them rather than hotels.

Version 1.0 2010-11-11 5
 (Great App from a Great Company!) I've been using AirBnB for almost 2 years now and this app has all of it's online browser features (including some new ones) incorporated in an easy to use and efficient app!

Congratulations to Joe, Brian, Nathan and the rest of the AirBnB team for their continued superb performance!

Version 1.0 2010-11-11 5
 (A Real Stunner!) What a great tool for one of the best—no, THE BEST—service of this sort in the world today. Sit in your armchair and either dream a trip or book alternatives to commercial accommodations. Beautifully designed and executed app, a really great addition to anyone's iPhone or iTouch who travels!

Version 1.0 2010-11-11 5
 (This is one sexy app) Honestly, could this app look any sharper? You can tell some seriously creative people are behind the design and this company! Great to have on your iPhone just on case you ever end up in a travel bind a need a last minute place to stay without paying the last minute high hotel price! I definitely recommend a download and check out the website as well! Happy Travels!

Version 1.0 2010-11-11 5
 (Longtime host) I can say this app is a beauty. It provides wonderful feedback for hosts and the ability to search, request, and approve reservations. 

If you use airbnb. U should have this. Come find me in Chicago !!!
