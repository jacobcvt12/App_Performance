Version 3.2.1 2014-03-17 5
It's the most interesting travel company
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-16 4
I haven't had any issues, but I usually use the site to book and the app to communicate or browse.
Version 3.3.0 2014-03-16 1
The app shuts itself off every time I try to enter the inboxes. Useless.
Version 3.1.0 2014-03-16 5
I love this app. It integrates well with iPhone and passbook. All the features of the website are there. For me, it was perfect for our last trip to Europe, everything was accessible and easy to find. Highly recommend.
Version 3.1.0 2014-03-16 4
Sometimes I think maybe the listings on the app are a little pared down compared to what's available when I view airbnb through a browser, but as far as checking up on things I've already booked, it's a great tool.
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-16 1
I liked the app previously. I host and travel and was able to manage my account, profile, see invoices,reservations, accepted reservation contact info. Basically everything you can do on the main site. This new app took all the usefulness away from the app and forces you to use the main site if you wanted to do anything other then see emails. This new app is like a first time project for a student who dabbles in app programming. 
Please restore the usefulness of the app. I don't need to see groups and standards or discover anything.  I need usability. I don't like half my screen taken up with the next guest arriving and their picture. I need to be able to access my host/guests information.  I need to be able to access invoices and billing history. If you restore those features from the previous version, this could be a great app. You also need an ipad version badly. Until real usability is restored, this app is useless. You can see all emails in your regular email client.

Version 3.3.1 2014-03-15 5
Very cool love al the design, can t wait to start working with it
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-15 1
It's an OK app. Needs a lots of improvement. I'm a host and I rather do staff over the internet then use this app. 
Further Update
Very disappointed. Couldn't even upload photos in order to do that you have to be on the seen and shoot and upload at the same time. How stupid is that? How about already taken once?
Further update. Very disappointed once again. Interface is good but rest is even worse then was
I totally hate this app. New version is the worst.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-15 1
The app used to work great until version 3 when it was completely changed, making more cumbersome and difficult to use.  Still 3.3.1 has major bugs.   Previously working features like copy/(pasting) of messages and the help contact page don't work properly any more.   If you happen to submit a message to a group you then will continue to receive notifications even if you turn off notifications (which is only possible from the website -- H-e-l-l-o!!) or even leave the group!!    AirBnB's advice: delete the app and re-install but that process deletes all stored saved responses!!  What a joke.  And overall the app is extremely slow.  They would do better to revert to version 2.0.  At least that was faster and worked right.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-14 5
This is sick
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-13 3
Needs a search filter for Cancellation Policy = flexible/moderate. 
After wasting so much time having to load properties with strict cancellation, I gave up after 30 mins.
Version 3.2.0 2014-03-13 5
LOVE AIRBNB!!! Can always find amazingly CHEAP an ADORABLE places!
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-13 2
After a pre-approval from the host, the app declined to continue with the booking, saying the dates were not available.
What could be simpler?
And the service fee they charge is simply outrageous, compared to the poor service Airbnb provides.
Disappointed.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-13 1
They should have left the very first version alone, it was the best. Now it doesn't work at all
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-13 1
Fails to provide the most basic functions for hosts
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-13 4
Fun and Functional
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-13 2
Crashes after 7.1 update.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-13 5
This is so much fun, I'm totally addicted! It is really a very comprehensive app! I love it! Really has everything at your fingertips!
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-12 1
Planning an AirBnB trip on the iPhone app is an exercise in frustration. 

AirBnB could offer a native, full-res killer app on the iPad which would be incredibly useful.

Do it!
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-12 3
After updating new version my wish list disappeared.
Version 3.3.0 2014-03-11 1
Can't login at iPhone 5S
Version 3.3.0 2014-03-11 1
Overly complicated for hosts. Would love the old version back!
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-11 3
It is SO ANNOYING to me when I see a badge notification and this one is ALWAYS wrong. I just ended up turning it off. Airbnb sends me texts anyways so I know when something is in my inbox. 

Otherwise, a good app. I haven't used it to update/create a listing or to reserve a place yet, but as far as being easy to use, informational & as a communicator, it works well. The notifications are all messed up though. I never get an app notification when I get a message (but I do get a text) and the badge is never correct.
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-10 5
Found out about AirBNB while looking for alternatives to VRBO/Homeaway. Love this app! Easy to use, lots of pics, and easy to get in touch with the host.
Version 3.2.0 2014-03-10 4
As a host, I rely on this app a great deal!  I love how easy it is to communicate with potential guests as well as pre-approve their bookings!  Keep up the good work Airbnb!
Version 3.2.0 2014-03-09 4
I was told about this app long time but didn't pay no mind to it. But this is really awesome! Work well for me when I went to Miami two weeks ago. Ill be booking thru this app my stays for all my trips for now on! Awesome house/apt for fair rate! Then actual hotel way to expensive. Def recommend!
Version 3.3.0 2014-03-08 5
The service of AirBnB is awesome, the website is more user friendly, as a traveler the app is real good, since it takes advantage of the map and GPS, but as a host the app is alright.
Version 3.3.0 2014-03-08 5
This is awesome
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-08 1
I like the idea of airbnb, and it has worked for me twice. This review concerns the App. I just discovered that the listing where I am currently 
staying look different depending on if you are on the App or the website. On the App version it says nothing about paying for people more than 3, paying a cleaning fee, or needing a security deposit that are stated on the Website. The cost per day is also different. I emailed airbnb that it doesn't make sense withholding information on the App and having two sources with different information. I only got a robotic response from airbnb which feels kind of sad. Airbnb can only work if there is good will and  respect from all parties concerned. I advice renters to look at both the App and Web sites, then check with hosts if there are hidden fees. I don't like to see either that a listed 'amenity' comes with a charge (in this case, use of washing machine for $10 per day.)
Version 3.3.0 2014-03-07 5
Great listings, solid policies from company. My go to site when traveling!!!
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-07 5
It tells me who is inquiring, booking, etc. It opens with who is at my house currently and who is coming next. Brilliant. Keeps me organized and keeps hosting fun, not a project I have to organize myself.
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-07 1
Stay away. Seriously, it is easier, cheaper, and less stressful to book w/ Expedia or Hostels.com. And be aware of their refund policy. They only refunded $34 out of a $124 booking. I gave them more than 24 hours notice, too.
Version 3.3.0 2014-03-07 4
It's like Craigslist, with more pictures. Kinda nervous. But MUST TRY NEW THING!
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-06 5
This app is the newest and greatest thing to happen for travelers of our generation! I'm surprised not as many people have reviewed on this app as I thought there would be. Air bnb is great to begin with but that app makes it that much more easier to get a glimpse into the way other people live. I love looking up places, when I'm bored, of places I would like to travel to. It's a fun and cultural way to pass the time. You may just end up planning a trip!
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-05 5
I love the app. It has helped us find wonderful vacations well with in our budgets.
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-03 2
Not a big fan of the UX UI. With the funding Airbnb has I expected much more thought than simply making something look pretty. 

The app has a horrible time refreshing data. Push messages are much better but the notification doesn't appear in the app itself on many occasions.

The multiple inboxes is confusing to a degree and how inbox messages are handled, appear as alerts when they should not is not a great experience.

As a host I find myself logging into the desktop app to take care of business after receiving a push notification due to above issues. 

I really wish Airbnb would beta test and listen to the #1 users of its apps, the hosts, more.
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-02 1
I have an iPhone 4 running iOS6 (moving to 7 kills performance). This app does not work reliably or rather at all on this phone. I could search and view, but the contact host capability only worked once. After that I couldn't enter travel dates. And you can't send the form with out travel dates.

Off to do this on a laptop now..if the app doesn't wok on older OS versions why not just prevent the download or warn the user?
Version 3.2.1 2014-03-01 4
We've been members for 4 years and using the app for as long as one has been available. The app functions fine, but we'd like a more iPad friendly version - would be nice if it could be viewed in portrait and landscape, and that offers the same features as on the website.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-28 1
So far, I'm not a fan of the app or service. Poor response time and it lacks an ability to write reviews (based on interactions), on people who you don't stay with
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-28 2
This app is just okay. For searching and booking a place, I think it's pretty good. If you try to list your own place and become a host, it will not let you click on which city you're in and you just end up getting stuck. It's a crucial part of the app and must be fixed asap!
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-27 4
Great app. There is the flag message thing that is wrong, but otherwise great. Get your airbnb on.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-27 1
No way
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-27 1
Can't edit your profile information in the app. Randomly have to verify your ID within 12 hours or your account will be suspended. Customer service is jus nonexistent.
Version 3.1.0 2014-02-25 5
It's the best travel app both for hosts and travelers! It is easy to use and has all the essentials!
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-25 5
Consistently great app
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-24 5
As someone who regularly travel at a moments notice, I have found airbnb to be a trusty tool!
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-23 5
love this app! great layout. but it would be great if you could cancel from the app instead of having to use a computer
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-23 1
There's no cancel button in the app and the app stops responding when I go to the help section to research how to cancel.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-22 3
Love the UI and how easy it is to book. When I open the app on my iPad it works fine but then crashes within the next 2 minutes of browsing. Please fix this bug.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-20 3
X btn at bottom easier to tap then top right when viewing photos. Why create 2 patterns for an interaction that needs 1
Version 3.1.0 2014-02-19 5
Love this app. We use it as hosts and guests and find it easy to use and pretty robust for an app.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-19 5
forget hotels, airbnb is the best way to save and enjoy the best cities in the world
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-18 2
Love the app and convenience of using but don't like that new message flag remains after reading note from potential guest(s).  Older versions removed "new message" flag as soon as you read the note. Please fix
Version 3.1.0 2014-02-18 5
For hosting, I can communicate with all of my guests, manage my calendar, and leave reviews. There will always be little things the full site can do easier than the app (cancellations, refunds, stuff I do roughly once every 3 mos) but the app gets what I need done. Not to mention with a clean layout and easy navigation.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-17 1
Seriously? No iPad app?
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-17 4
Please increase the timeout or let users choose that time limit. Alternatively have a 'history' or a 'recently looked at' section where we can see what we were looking at before the app timed us out.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-17 4
App is continuously being updated and in the year I have been hosting my properties I use the mobile app the most and it has been very good. Once in a while it will have its glitches and bugs but that is common to any travel app. I highly recommend. 
Thanks airbnb.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-17 1
Airbnb's software is terrible, and the current version of the iPhone app is no different. As of this writing, I can't add a location while listing an apartment, which means I CAN'T LIST AN APARTMENT. Are you kidding me? The single most important thing in their app is broken. Thanks Airbnb!
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-17 5
Traveled cross country staying with airbnb hosts and the app allowed me to keep in contact with hosts, make additional bookings and leave reviews. Very useful, but would like to be able to cancel reservation from app.
Version 3.2.0 2014-02-16 5
We had a wonderful experience at the ARThouse in Grand Rapids, Ohio through airbnb.com. 
We rented the house on the river ( the Maumee) which was filled with art of all kinds....paintings, handmade furniture, glassworks which made the home so bright and fun! The Host, Sara Weaver, was so accommodating and made us feel right at home. She really went the extra mile to make our weekend romantic and extra- special! 
The home itself was most inviting ....it has 3 bedrooms ( the master bedroom was especially well-appointed!) the living room area had a gas fireplace and paintings on every wall, like an art gallery! One of our favorite rooms was the large sunroom overlooking the Maumee River. We even saw Bald Eagles both of the days that we stayed! The kitchen had everything we could have desired and more! Sara left a few very nice surprises! She was truly " the Hostess with the Mostess!" I am thankful that we found this gem on the airbnb.com website. I highly recommend this vacation getaway to anyone who is traveling in Northeastern Ohio.

I've been an Airbnb host for 4 years and their mobile apps have NEVER been up to snuff. I respond to an inquiry on my iPad and yet it shows as an active inquiry on my iPhone. The best version is still the desktop version. Airbnb, with the money you're raking in, you should do better for the people making you rich. I used to admire your internet saavy and now it's just 'meh'.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-16 1
Wow slow and lame, get it fixed ASAP
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-16 1
It won't open!!
Version 3.2.0 2014-02-15 1
This is a truly terrible mobile experience. I'm a product manager at a mobile startup and this is one of the worst experiences I've seen. The UI is confusing and doesn't work. Messages disappear and reappear later. It's pretty much unusable. You guys have raised enough money to give us a useable app.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-15 1
Seriously guys?  Do you need to spam me?
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-15 3
Nice but it crashes! I tried several times to verify my profile by taking a picture of my driver license within the app and it crashed every time. I finally took the picture first and then up loaded it using the app and it worked. Looks like there are still a few bugs to be worked out.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-14 5
This app is the only app I'll ever use to book another place to stay next time I travel. Excellent experience everywhere I've stayed. The app is easy to use and fun to browse!
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-13 1
I just downloaded the app for iPhone. But I've been using the online website. Terrible database, not user friendly, difficult to try and get back to something you saw previously, 
And the founders are sitting in their dr. Strangelove conference room laughing .
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-13 2
It's a nice app but it won't let me use the location feature when I try and list my room for rent. Once they fix this I would rate the app higher.
Version 3.2.0 2014-02-13 3
I find this app extremely annoying to use. Developers have made good improvements with each iteration, but overall still pretty clunky to use. Some messages don't actually make it to my guests. Not good! Also, get an ipad app already!!!!!!!
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-13 4
This app is wonderful and the layout is modern and clean. The only thing I noticed was that the total sum you inquire about is different in the messages on the app vs the messages when using the website. I think it's because the app doesn't take into account the fees. Also the app does not show fees when viewing listings.
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-13 2
App would be better if it didn't crash every few minutes
Version 3.2.1 2014-02-12 2
It's a beautiful app, great user interface, and lots of helpful features, but it crashes on me every few minutes. Very frustrating, especially in the middle of a search for listings.  If the crashes stopped, I'd rate 4 stars. Still has limited functionality compared to an online search but it's not bad.
Version 3.1.0 2014-02-12 4
It's a good mobile app. The only problem I have is that it keeps crashing when I look at the map. Please fix :)
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-17 5
AirBnB looks and works beautifully!
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-16 2
Please make an iPad version.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-15 1
The new app is an awful cumbersome slow-to-load buggy mess. Bring back the old app pretty please!!!
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-15 2
The date selection only work for the next month or so. What if I want to select arrival date 4 mons out? Air bnb is awesome but this app isn't, yet...
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-15 5
Absolutely recommend this app and website. Great service and better than a hostel or couch surfing in every way except money.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-14 5
Easy, accessible..booked, communicated, stayed and reviewed all on your app. Will use again and again
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-14 2
the iPhone app has a LOT of bugs that make it quite difficult to use. Old inquiries stay on the home screen; notifications for new messages come in but upon opening the inbox, we are unable to see them. This makes it difficult to correspond with prospective guests when we're away from the computer. Edits to our listing don't always appear, and the app takes quite a while to reflect our up to date info. Not sure if that's the same for our guests-
We're looking forward to the next iteration of this app - we love AirBnb and ease of mobile use would help us greatly! It would be nice to have the ability to update the Guidebook feature using this app as well.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-14 5
This app and ideal isa great way to help the next person learn bout others. To open your home/place for others to have a clean place to relax and take in the area with your help of the place to see or go. Love it, can't wait to get back to traveling now
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-13 5
I'll travel the world only using this app if it's possible. 

AE
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-11 4
Yup, awesome!
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-11 1
I just recently became a host on AirBnB and this iPhone app is confusing. Like another reviewer said, the messages disappear or don't update and it continues to show an alert despite you having already read the message. 

Very random and confusing.
Version 3.0.2 2014-01-11 1
This update is really bad. I have been using airbnb for 4 years both as a host and guest and love it, but this new interface has been moved around in an arbitrary way, has made it harder to navigate as a host, crashes constantly and doesn't put current messages at the top. Please please go back to where it was or give us access to a retroactive downgrade.  

Thanks Airbnb!
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-10 2
Beautiful, efficient site but after last update randomly crashes on me.  Will have to use non-mobile site until fixed.  Using ipad mini...
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-10 5
This app has changed my life - traveling has never been better or cheaper.
Version 3.0.0 2014-01-10 5
Saved me so much money on my vacation, and turned out to be a much better experience than if I had stayed in a hotel. Now I'm just waiting for an iPad app.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-08 5
I wish more people would travel this way. I love traveling as if I were a local. Getting to stay in actual neighborhoods is THE BEST way to experience an area. Hotels are always in someplace like "Times Square". I love getting to meet people living in different countries it always feels like I'm staying with friends.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-07 5
Why pay for a hotel when you can stay in a fully equipped home for half the cost? The places to stay are  great and the hosts I have met have been excellent.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-07 5
Airbnb is a fantastic concept, and the apps - on iPhone and iPad - are great. Love the new layout displaying beautiful listings from around the world, while keeping the process of searching and booking with hosts straightforward and efficient.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-07 1
I love airbnb but the new app is quite useless as a host and for searching for locations to rent.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-06 5
Great service!  EZ app to use. This is perfect for either the person who would use a hotel only for the bed/sleep, and doesn't need hotel facilities. When on vacation, I'm typically on the go and out the door early am, and back late night. Too much to do. Hotels seemed a waste of money. This is the perfect solution!! Saved lots of $$$.
Version 2.6.3 2014-01-06 5
Wonderful flow. This is a hip n' happenin' lil app.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-06 5
I love this service
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-06 3
Great app. Nicely put together but crashes every 5-10 mins.
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-05 5
this app has been a lifesaver for our move across country. it's accurate and fast. READ the reviews, that's what makes this work!
Version 3.1.0 2014-01-05 2
The phone app is not user friendly and occasionally freeze.  I am surprised by the low level of functionality.
Version 3.1.0 2013-12-23 5
Very user friendly app for one of the most convenient global services!! I love airbnb!!
Version 3.1.0 2013-12-23 5
Ive used the app primarily as my management tool for the site and have not had any problems with it. 

The slider however should go below $110.
Version 3.1.0 2013-12-22 5
What an amazing concept. Can't wait to use it!
Version 3.1.0 2013-12-21 5
This company gets it.
Version 3.1.0 2013-12-20 4
Overall this app works smoothly. I use it most for listing and managing my own rental space. 
I am writing this review is to tell the developer
1- update the calendar to allow the user to look into the past- it would be very useful for the host to have this history available. 
2- on the host page, you might consider merging the 'listings' page into the host page; as a sub menu, perhaps. I am sure most users have only one space listed. On busy days I navigate this menu many times, and it gets annoying to pass through this useless page.
Version 3.1.0 2013-12-20 5
Love the new design interface. Cant wait to become a host to try the new host options.
Version 3.1.0 2013-12-20 1
I love this app. I'm a seasoned business traveler and I have stayed in the best hotels around the world. This app and the whole Airbnb concept has kept me away from hotels--even with all the points I have earned over the past 20 years--for vacation travel.

Our first booking was for Dublin last September; then we booked in New Orleans in November and now we're booked for Barcelona in March. I honestly don't think we'll ever book a chain hotel when we travel for pleasure in the future.

The app itself deserves 5 stars; no question. But I'm giving it 1 star in protest for not having an iPad version. Come on, Airbnb; we need an iPad version. Why is it taking you so long?

The app is crashing when scrolling and loading rentals. 

Very helpful in finding short term living. The service concept is good.

Will give three stars because of instability. If fixed, then 5 stars.
Version 3.1.0 2013-12-19 5
Airbnb has literally changed my life! The ability to meet people all over the world and see places I would have never known about without the kind help and recommendations of locals. Not to mention unique and amazing homes that make you feel at home when you are thousands of miles away from your own! LOVE this site and app is super easy and fun to use :)
Version 3.1.0 2013-12-19 5
Beautiful app, and so easy to use.  Not only do you see and pick the place you will be staying with stunning  pics, but you also get to learn about your host, to help you with your experience with your travel stay

This is the Future Now
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-19 5
Better than a hotel.  Great way to travel. Have used it twice and both were great experiences. Recommended
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-18 5
Love it!
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-18 1
New update is really cute and all but definitely not user friendly. You can't do a lot of things with the app anymore without having to get on a laptop, which defeats the whole purpose. You can't view alerts, accept offers or as a host look at your account/payout. Someone didn't think this one through at all. The old Airbnb was just fine.
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-17 5
I've used air b'n'b twice now with surprising and enlightening results. What I find most amazing, apart from the app's quality and the great service is how it creates genuine connections with people.
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-17 4
Easy to find something to do or stay or eat. Maps are very helpful.
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-17 5
Simple, elegant, and functional. This app makes booking & browsing fun!
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-17 5
This app is the best! I love to travel and airbnb helps me find the best places  to stay at!
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-17 4
Great website, amazing service, so-so app.
The new iOS 7 app is a little confusing, not at all intuitive. The old one was much better than the website itself!
Thanks Airbnb for the service though, and hope to see an ipad app soon!!
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-16 5
Love this app. Just the right features, super clean and well crafted design.
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-16 1
Airbnb should have spent as much energy thinking about how people actually will use their app as they are now spending writing fake reviews on the App Store here.  The inbox is counterintuitive.  The notifications are stuck on.  I've twice sent Special Offers to hosts where the price didn't change as I instructed it to, which embarrassed me as a host. 

I just deleted this app.  Can't do bookings on the go.  This is worse than bad - it's actually a liability.  

This is coming from an experienced Airbnb host.  

If Airbnb reads this review - fire your development team and get off your high horse.  This app is all aesthetics with no logic, and bad functioning.
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-15 5
Already love airbnb, this app brings it to a whole nother level. The app is very clean and easy to use. Especially impressed with the inbox section!
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-15 2
Cool tool for finding properties to rent.  But the UI isn't friendly - entered my cc info - didn't put in the full year for the expiry - so the app just did nothing - should have at least given an error message - I thought it froze ...
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-15 5
We use Airbnb whenever we travel. It has also been a huge tool in the success of our rental property. Their customer service is unmatchable. The website and app are user friendly and reliable. If you are considering renting your property or a bedroom in your home, start here!
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-27 5
One of the best user experiences you can get on a listing iOS app. Totally love how easy georgeous flats could be found & booked. 

People complaining about lacking fancy places in their area and one-staring the app are dumb.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-27 1
Crashes and hangs. New user interface looks sleek but feels horrible. This update feels like a rush job with little actual QA work done.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-26 2
Just upgraded. Screen has been frozen for over 5 minutes. Will have to reboot iPhone.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-26 5
I love being able to respond so quickly and easily with my guests through the app. I love airbnb anyway but I am glad they have such a good app.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-26 3
..crummy new interface. Approve and deny buttons used to be on the same page as leaving a message. That should be a no-brainer. Now it is two steps. Dumb.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-25 1
Horrible, not user friendly. Old one was MUCH better.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-25 5
Love it, Airbnb changed how I travel and the app is easy to use.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-24 5
I've been using airbnb for the last few years and I can't find a better way to book rooms for all of my getaways. Stateside or overseas, it's my favorite site that connects me with the coolest locations to stay. And a plus, the app is just as easy as the website. I love the vacation ideas when it first opens up and the wish list function. It allows me to bum around in there anytime to see where I want to take my next trip. It's a great function to have it linked to your phone number and personal email so you have easy access to messages from hosts. Something that can be a time crunch depending on how you choose to plan :) All that said, I love the app and the site and tell EVERYONE about it.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-24 3
Doesn't have a lot of users in my area
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-24 2
When we arrived to our Airbnb reservation, we discovered the place could not accommodate as many as advertised.  We called Airbnb to help us resolve the issue, and they provided no assistance, nor would they hold the owner responsible for their listing. Frustrating and disappointing.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-24 5
First off, the travel experience that Airbnb delivers is both solid and revolutionary. It turns the lodging industry on its head by allowing travelers to go to unique places and interact with interesting an nice locals. Authentic travel is back. I've used Airbnb throughout Europe and the USA, and I've had success at every location. 

Second, this app update is impressive. The Airbnb app was already a good product, but 3.0 improves. The process of moving through the screens (especially jumping from search to profile to hosting) is simplified and the UI is cleaner. 

Download the app, and explore the world... or start small and go to an interesting town in your area: there is probably an Airbnb location there.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-24 5
Wide variety of unique places to stay on vacation or in your city.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-23 2
Crashes every 10 minutes.
Version 3.0.2 2013-11-23 5
Airbnb is awesome!
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-23 1
It's so bad, it crashed and froze as soon as I opened it.  I've been trying for over half an hour just to figure out how to unfreeze it, or, better yet, switch back to the old app.  But it's stuck and so am I.  Because of this awful app, it seems I won't be able to use airbnb again from my phone.  Ever.  Unless they make a new app that actually works....
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-23 5
Airbnb and the homes available are truly great
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-23 1
I think you got on the flat train a bit too fast. Wazzup with the small fonts, the low contrast? Its hidious. U put design in front of usability. And may I say horrid design.
 People with lower computer skills as my mother are lost in the app now.
Kudos for Airbnb home though.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-23 5
Full of choices in regards to locations, rental types, and so on. 24hr On-Line Support Staff are extremely helpfull whenever needed. All an out, a must type of app, for everyone that travels awAy from home.
   Have used Hbnb to book places to stay when traveling to Iceland. Never had any problems! Now I'm involved in hosting! Great app!
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-23 3
The app use to push notifications flawlessly and fast.  Before, If I had an inquiry or a message in my inbox, I would get the notification immediately, and when it had been read the little red '1' would immediately go away.  Now it's super glitchy. 

The new update is pretty ugly, and business like, which I'm sure many people appreciate, but not this right brained person.  

Besides that, it does have some great little features and still functions pretty well, I just REALLY want real time notifications to work again!  I rely on them to respond in a timely manner.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-22 5
Awesome and easy to use!!
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-22 1
Complicated compare to earlier version
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-22 5
This App is a lucky charm for avid travelers; if you're looking to explore the world while trying to save money as much as possible this is for you! I was happy I found this app because I'm planning on going home to the Philippines next year and they have a bunch of listing! It helps that most listings are very descriptive and have photos so you would know what to expect.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-22 1
Tried to update, no luck! Will not finish downloading. I'm still running iOS 6 on my iPad 3
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-22 5
Great for getting travel and hosting information on the go!
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-22 5
Awesome app for adventure planning in the near or distant future! This app is also on top of its technical design! Kudos app design team! :)
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-21 1
I guess they meant well putting in all the flashy fanciness but from a host perspective it makes it really hard to manage things. The version before was nice and simple, you knew where to do things and didn't really need your computer. 
Now I'd rather wait with doing anything until I'm back at my computer and can use the website. 
UI fail.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-21 1
The new version is terrible for hosts. I can't see or manage my listing and have no way to access my inbox. Then I stupidly signed out to see if signing in fresh would help... Now I'm locked out. I keep getting a server error. AirBNB: Please fix ASAP so we can continue managing our listings via our phones.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-21 5
Intuitive design that matches current iOS UI style. Extremely responsive and more importantly, the privacy settings are transparent and straightforward. Great job airbnb
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-21 4
not bad
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-21 5
Very friendly version, easy to follow on the mobile app, no worries of cc declined or people back ground.
Highly recommended if you want to make some extra money.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-21 5
The app is great - but I hate how their icon looks. Flat...
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-21 5
Very good app for travel no longer need to book a hotel airbnb much better rates allow you to experience local life style. 

Ps loved new simplified design...
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-20 5
About to venture off on our tour to happiness and see what we have been dreaming about! Couldn't ask for a better app that enables that exploration!!! :) #backpackers #oddplacestostay
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-20 1
First off, I find it disrespectful for software developers to change EVERYTHING in one version change.  I'm a host. We are daily users of your application and trying to run a business.  With that said, the new version needs to at least better then the previous and this version fails. Problems I've found:

1. Can't view guest full profile pictures, typically heads get cut off.  FAIL.
2. Software bugs, it often reads 'NULL' in places where the title of your property would be.
3. Biggest problem for me as a host, you can't send special offers after you've already preapproved.  So it you are trying to negotiate a rate, you have to goto their website.  The old version can do that at any point.
4. Layout is horrible.  The organization of information is not intuitive, I still find my self digging for things.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-20 1
The reservations tab is gone! I have multiple units so this tab was very helpful. Now I have to look at multiple calendars to keep up with who is checking in/out. Cumbersome!  Please bring it back.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-20 1
Sigh. i cannot use new app to manage bookings like i could in the previous version. how do i revert back? sure it looks good, style over substance doest help me.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-19 5
Easy. 
Great experiences :)
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-19 5
So convenient to use!
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-18 5
very very nice looking app and works pretty good as well
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-18 5
Simple Direct Sophisticated

This app exceeded my expectations in every way. This is the best travel booking app I have seen. Airbnb rocks!
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-18 5
Very easy to use. I write all my reviews for our stays on this because it's so fast. Haven't booked using it but checking on current reservations and communicating through it is great. Nice design too!
Version 2.6.3 2013-11-18 3
I find this app to have decent functionality, but I'm typically going to the site to do more involved tasks beyond checking in.  Also, would be nice if this actually fit a full iPad screen.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-17 5
I love airbnb, the app is wonderful and the update is amazing, it simplifies everything and makes it look great on iOS7! The concept is even better and has saved my boyfriend I I tons of money traveling. Don't ever go away, airbnb!
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-17 1
Wow Airbnb has historically done so many things right.  Just don't upgrade.  Someone should be fired for this monstrosity of an app.  The calendar, the inbox, well, most things are just broken now.  The old app rocked, even had some nice features the website didn't have.  This new app is atrocious.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-17 5
That version is absolutely fantastic!!!
I love it as a host especially 
but also because it really helps communicating with guests on my phone at the speed of light.
* there's a little problem though I'm sure it will be fixed soon, you can't offer a special offer from the mobile once you  pre-approved someone.
If the person asks for a revision of rate based on other guest staying less time than the one booking, or simply guest asking for a special rate.
You have to go to the computer to do this and it kills the point of that version.
Thank you Airbnb for sorting the earth:)
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-17 5
Airbnb is everything good about traveling the world! I love it!
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-16 1
Usually don't write reviews - but the new UI is terrible ( host perspective ) It looks negligibly better and the navigation is horrendous. It takes me 100% more time to accomplish simple tasks like pre-approving a guests stay.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-16 4
My husband and I were using the app at the same time(I had the new version and he had the old one). So mine didn't show even half of the results he had got. I hope it's possible for you to fix that as the app is very useful and the upgrades make a lot of sense.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-16 5
This is the most addictive, sexually enticing experience I've ever felt on my iPhone. Shout out to the AirBNB team!!!
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-16 5
You guys did it. It's a beautiful app, gorgeous design. Excellent. Like it so much.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-16 1
Wouldn't let me sign in with Facebook, didn't accept my credit card, but full website did...broken much?
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-16 5
wouldn't travel anywhere without it. Incredible concept.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-16 4
Its very clean and streamlined. The design is definitely to date with the times! Ive yet to use its full potential but i like it thus far.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-16 5
The best app ever.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-16 5
Gorgeous app with a lot of thoughtful design behind it all. A joy to use.
Version 3.0.1 2013-11-15 5
Great travel plannig app.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-15 1
Everything is gone. I'm booked through next Feb and I have nothing on the app. Host Home is not on this app.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-15 1
Oh how I love airbnb. But this app is terrible. I don't know why they decided to change it, but the developers should be fired.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-15 1
I now can't access my Host account to accept reservations, exchange emails, manage my listing, calendar, edits, nothing! It's rendered completely useless. This is an epically terrible release, if it's an error. This is an epic fail on the UX design, if this access still exists but it's it's hidden under some menu I have not found yet, despite my direct experience with UX design for apps.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-15 1
This app has been telling me for a week that I have one notification as a host, but when I clicked the host button it didn't even show I was logged in. I guess they fixed that, but now it turns out the notification was people who amicably decided to rent another room. So I guess what I need to do is go on and decline their reservation. Oops, now there's a bug that won't let me do that. Will this affect my listings rankings? Probably.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-15 1
As a host I cannot view my messages. The update is pretty but has made the app useless!! What is the point of this?!?
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-15 3
I couldn't access inquiries coming in or my calendar. However, once I left the app and came back in the hosting tools showed up.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 4
It's much prettier than the older versions but had stayed quite fast. I like it!
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 2
I don't like the new app design. It is too much like a website and not enough like an app.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
Refreshing host inbox does not work. Viewing listings doesn't work. Can't write messages to go along with "pre-approval" it has to be done separate. Message threads are sorted in the wrong order.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
Use your browser on a computer.  The newest version of the iPhone app is not functioning properly and has very limited features.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
May have deleted my listing, can't find old messages anywhere, totally deleting and re downloading hoping to solve some issues, thank goodness I don't have any guests checking in today.

Total fail.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 2
I can't get any of my host inbox messages.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
All the features that made the app great are gone. The inbox is empty, I can only see my travel reservation emails not my hosting communication.  The calendar is gone, the new emails don't show up.  I can't manage reservations! Help.  Please fix so or let me know how to roll back.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
The new version has a lot of bugs that needs fixed. First off I already have listing and it is not showing. It keeps asking me to post a listing. Second it says my messages have moved as a host, yet I am not able to find them anywhere. I used to use this mobile version when I was at work. This will no longer be the case until it is fixed. This was a very frustrating update.

Version 2.5.1 2013-11-14 4
Layout look so nice, but quite complicated to use. I still get lost in the app.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
With this update it seems like the hosting functions are gone. Where's my calendar? The user interface is ridiculously obtuse. I definitely don't recommend this app. Stick with the desktop version!
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
New update is horrible. My listing is gone, all my messages are MIA, I have a phantom notification, and the interface is a bit dizzying. Nothing wrong with the old version- why fix it if it ain't broke?!? Please revert back to what works!!!!!
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
Update: very buggy update. For hosts with multiple listings, the lack of chronological check outs is a killer.(really need a multi-cal like on the web) Inbox is disorganized. I can only see 2-3 lines of text in the compose window (when using Siri dictation, I sometimes can't see anything) New inquiries don't show which listing they are asking about. Host home doesn't update correctly. Refreshing the app feels like I'm back on my dial up internet connection from the '90s. 

------------------------/

Airbnb is so incredibly empowering!  Making new friends (and I don't mean 'friends') from all over the world has never been so easy. I love the sense of trust and community we have here.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
As a long time host, I do all my communication on the airbnb app. Yet my reservations no longer show up here! What happened? It seems as if it is only meant for travelers. But I use this many times a day. This app is terrible.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 4
My first experience with the new version was as described below. A day later I see a new heading, HOST HOME, which was not there before. With this new section all the features related to hosting seem to be back. Great look, layout, and easy to use. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW
This new version, 11/12/2013, looks great BUT looses so many critical features!!!!  No access to Inbox, no grouping of all reservations, no way to communicate with guests. And IF those features are there, they definitely aren't easy to find. I didn't find them!
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 5
Great way to meet new people!!!  Amazing way to get the "real deal
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 2
If u r missing your listings with this latest version, too, logout, then log back in. Fixed.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 5
Nice work, guys.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
Just because the app looks similar to iOS 7 doesn't mean it's good. I am an existing host. My listing cannot be seen and there are no messages from my inbox visible on the app.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-14 1
As a host, I lost my listing. Says I have 4 new 
messages but I can't find out how to access them. Very inconvenient for hosts managing listings on the go.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
This app was written by people who don't know how to write mobile apps. Even the simplest thing is hard to figure out. I hope they outsource to a company that knows how to do this correctly.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
The new version is slow and buggy. Once I turned my phone on and off the app worked better, but still not up to par with the previous version. 

New isn't always better.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
The app is nice but is missing the calendar, which is annoying because I can't just check when the next check in is anymore, now I have to go on the computer to look at something that took me 5 seconds before.
Version 2.6.3 2013-11-13 1
The new version doesn't really work. I can't find the messages from my potential guests anymore. The inbox has been reserved for me only as a guest! Really? In the past, I was able to see all my communications, be it as a host or as a guest, in one place. It was simple and intuitive. Why fix it when it works?
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 5
I love the new app!  Everyone who doesn't is just spitting sour grapes. :)...  When can we get an equally awesome tablet app?
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 2
same problem reported by other users.  i've hosted several times but the app seems to have no knowledge that i even have a listing up.  how did that get through QA?

and seriously, how is it possible that this still doesn't work on the ipad?!  it's not like it's a new device.. come on, guys.  kindof amazing that a company with so much funding and a fancy new office still hasn't bothered to release a version of their app that works natively on the ipad.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
As a host I am unable to communicate with my guests,  view my listings or do anything else as it relates to hosting. :(
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
Looks nice but the host inbox is gone. I can only see an inbox from the travel box.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
This app made no progress through the update, it's even worse actually. Thinking to boycott air bnb all together.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
I've been a host for two years. The latest version of the iPhone app is completely useless if you're a host. I cannot access my listings, calendar, or any of my current or future reservations. I'm also a long-time mobile app developer. AIRBNB SHOULD FIRE THE UX DESIGNER AND PRODUCT MANAGER WHO LAUNCHED THIS VERSION OF THE APP. They clearly put their fascination with iOS7 design aesthetic ahead of creating an app that is easy and enjoyable to use. Pathetic.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 5
Airbnb has improved their app so much I would say it's the best most efficient app I'm using at the moment.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 5
I thoroughly enjoy this app.  While traveling to luxury hotels can be relaxing and hostels can be adventurous, nothing compares to the local experience that airbnb allows you to create.  Thanks airbnb team;)
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
This new version is horrible. Wait before upgrading to restore all functionality from the old version.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 2
New iOS 7 version has nice eye candy, but very confusing. My listing doesn't show up, and I can't find my incoming messages. Needs work.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
I used to love the airbnb app. It allowed me to handles listing and boom trips on the go, communicate easily, and be alerted to changes. The new upgrade ruined it all. I cannot even get to my inbox anymore. The layout is confusing. This is a case of design overwriting functionality. Hope they remediate soon
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
As a host I lost all the features. Inbox is empty, I cannot talk with my guest, I do not see upcoming reservation,... I cannot use this app with this version!! The new update looks nice but all the features are gone.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
I suddenly lost the ability to respond to requests and inquiries! Frustrating. Please fix soon! We love air b&b but this update made the app completely useless.
Version 3.0.0 2013-11-13 1
No calendar, nor emails, nor alerts!!
Please fix ASAP!
Version 2.6.3 2013-11-04 5
An amazingly intuitive and simple design structure. Thank you!
Version 2.6.3 2013-11-04 5
The best app on my phone & ipad. Quick and intuitive, it makes being a host and guest a breeze.
Version 2.6.3 2013-11-02 5
By far one of the best apps on the App Store! It is incredibly well designed and so easy to use. Very rarely do I enjoy using an app more than the website!!!
Version 2.6.3 2013-11-02 5
I truly love this service. Cheap and easy to travel anywhere and you always find a friendly host. Much better than a hotel a billion times.

We are addicted to AirBnB. Why would stay at a traditional hotel ever again?
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-31 3
Love the app. Need to be able to filter by amenities and sort results by price.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-30 1
If you have a problem with your reservation the online resolution tool doesn't work on the app. Try to call? They send you back online, to an app that takes your booking great but won't help you cancel or contact customer support. It's just a scam.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-29 5
Excellent idea.  Great app that is a breeze to use and that keeps you informed.  Use it, you WILL love it.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-28 5
Life changing site- but need to see property's dates of availability with calendar view like on the site.  
Still giving you five stars though since you're awesome.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-28 5
I just booked a weekend getaway accommodation using this app....I'm hooked! Awesome, awesome concept.  Process is fun, easy, inviting, and an eye-opening experience. It's possible to travel without paying outrageous hotel costs. I love this app!!!

I love airbnb, but for some reason the price slider will not go below $114. What the heck! Will just have to use my computer version till they fix this.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-27 5
Great App for a great housing service!
I can reply to guest inquiries within the allotted 24 hours easily.
I can book a place from my mobile phone anywhere anytime.
Home stays in Europe (and probably elsewhere) are so much better than hotels, hostels, etc. and cheaper. This App makes it easy.
I love the ability to touch to make dates "unavailable".
Airbnb is excellent. So is this App! Well done!
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-22 4

Love this app... Super easy to use and then get lost in all of the dreamy adventure!
Version 2.6.1 2013-10-11 5
I know there are limitations to the iPhone app but they are minor compared to fact that even though I don't book everyone who inquires, so many people are able to search for and view my property. 

Customer Service is the best I have ever experienced. They are very knowledgeable and expedite issues. 

I highly recommend Airbnb for Hosts and Travelers. I will be traveling around the holidays and will use Airbnb. I also hope to be able to use Airbnb for our large family Reunion next summer.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-10 5
AirBnB you are a dream to use! Ever since you sent a professional photog over to my place to snap pics I fell in love. And the app to accompany your website is superb! Anyone that is complaining needs to understand that the app does all the basics that you need (from the host side) and even more on the guests side. The pictures to accompany the posts, along with the map friendly posts are insane. Thx for changing the way I backpack and experience the WORLD!!
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-10 2
Where's the calendar...????? Kind of important!
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-10 5
I'm glad to have this to be able to respond quickly to reservations!
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-08 4
One of the recent updates to the app has broken passbook integration. This was working just a couple weeks ago because I used it. Now when I try to add a stay to passbook it brings up the "loading" mask but quickly falls back to the reservation I am looking at, and nothing is added to passbook.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-07 4
This app is great, I'm just having some trouble trying to add a passbook pass to my passbook. It keeps loading but it won't add.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-07 5
This app and business in general have been a life changing moment for myself and my family. Having AirBnB at my finger tips while I am living my daily life has been so great. I can manage my listings and communication with guests. I am very happy with its usability.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-05 5
The app is good, though the iPhone interface on the ipad is kind of clunky and annoying. It's nice to access the basic contact info for your hosts without a web connection. However the inability to slide the price range under $114 makes it basically unusable for me (and the price slider on the web version is also annoying as hell, so that's saying something). If that part was fixed, I would use the app a lot more.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-04 5
This app turns a normal vacation into a home-made adventure...by staying in neighborhood homes in far-off places, we felt immersed in the culture and cared for by people that knew the land the best!! I am a huge fan of Air BNB, I love that the app is secure, payments are made easily and safely, and all the photos are verified as being accurate.  Huge fans of this app.
Version 2.6.3 2013-10-03 5

Great job airbnb. And what a party in LA! Woohoo!
Version 2.6.2 2013-10-01 5
We just returned from our first trip using Airbnb and we are excited!  We were not sure what to expect at first, but using this app has been seamless. Everything was as written and agreed upon! No hidden fees, no surprise taxes, etc. we look forward to using this app for all of our vacation plans in the future!
Version 2.6.2 2013-10-01 3
I've updated everything but the app suddenly crashes when I select "Favorites". Otherwise a very handy app. I hope it gets fixed soon.
Version 2.6.2 2013-09-30 2
When I try to save favorites the app just closes. Every time. Not cool.
Version 2.6.2 2013-09-30 4

Best travel app ever. Works great for iphone5S
Version 2.6.2 2013-09-29 4
Just started using air bnb with this app. It is really well designed and based on a good premise. It is quick to send inquiries to hosts and it is very streamlined in every way. My only complaint is that the hosts address is not displayed on the page when it is pre approved, like on the website. Several times we were left without an address looking for the place by pictures and directions alone, which was frustrating. 

All in all, highly recommend this one for any traveler.
Version 2.6.2 2013-09-29 5
Not sure why all the negative reviews, we use airbnb allllllll the time because we are constantly traveling and this app makes it so so easy to book, email, look up reservations etc.
Version 2.6.2 2013-09-29 1
App seems geared more for guests booking than for hosts. I was on the road once and actually had to go to my son's dorm room to use his computer to change one of my settings to allow a guest to stay one night, as it was set to two and they couldn't book. It has very few settings for hosts beside the basics..and it should. Don't you want us to be able to accept more bookings while on the road? A company this big needs to adapt this app to allow hosts do more mobilely. And for heaven's sake would you please make an iPad version!
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-17 5
I like it!
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-17 4
Works as advertised. Saved money and had good experiences. Easy with credit card interface. W other services I've had to pay cash upon arrival and its kinda unnerving.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-17 4

Version 2.6.1 2013-09-16 5
Awesome app although sometimes I wish it was similar to the website but not a big deal.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-16 5
We have used air bnb twice now and it is the best!!! We have met very nice people and stayed in some lovely lovely places!!!
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-15 4
1.We love airbnn!!!...we sugest before pushing Reserve-to contact the person and wait for his reply with confirmation about availibility and only then reserve;)

As if you push reserve without "verification"-your Visa account will be "blocked" for some time(in our case-2 weeks)...and if you "reserve" couple times..."blocked money" could make your visa "empty" and you could not use it (unless you put more money).

2.also would be nice to pay in cash-upon arriving...same as with booking.com -you make reservation with VISA (no money blocked) and pay in cash or credit card upon arriving;)
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-15 4
The airbnb app was a little shaky at first but it's obvious they have been putting steady effort into making it more and more user friendly for hosts and travelers alike. I use it daily and fine the design, layout and UI far above most travel apps on the market.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-15 3
Well, every time I add a home to my wish list on my computer it no longer shows up on the app. I have to delete and re-install the app in order for it to reappear. Very frustrating!!
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-15 5
This makes traveling so much easier, the people seem great too!  Nice places
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-13 4
Love this app, just booked my first place so have yet to know how that turns out but it was very easy to do.  However we need an iPad app.  I use my iPad for my travels rather than my phone.  When can we expect an iPad version?
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-11 5
Best app ever for travel accommodations. I have used it for 4 trips now and there aren't enough stars for how I feel.

I do really love Airbnb! Thank you so much for such a great tool for shrinking the world!
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-11 4
I love airbnb.  And I really like the airbnb app.  It doesn't have the same functionality of the airbnb website but it makes my life easier to deal with requests for my airbnb listing at any time anywhere.   I am confident improvements will be made to make the experience closer to the website.  And, I am happy to test the app and provide feedback.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-11 5
I use AirBnB when I travel and have LOVED the places I've stayed and the people I've met - and I also have a listing on AirBnB that I manage with ease on the app from anywhere. Thanks AirBnB!
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-10 5

The app, finally improved over a rather stodgy version beforehand, helps bring to my fingers the very literal- rest of the world. A devotee, sadly unpaid, for Airbnb that I am, I use this app to preach the world of sharing, as well as what I consider a much more pure version of traveling. 
The reviews make it so much more reliable to select a location, but through whatever arm twisting employed by Airbnb corporate, the pictures now are better, reflecting a move towards actual "good" photography and no longer grainy out of focus cell phone snaps.
Couple that with a more stable app and you are ready to explore no matter where you find yourself. I hope in future versions there's a tie in somehow to some sort of "time out" style guide for locals. Because now with this new app, you're that much closer to being a local yourself!
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-07 5
Terrific app! Allows us to respond promptly to inquiries and stay in touch with our guests before, during, and after their stay.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-07 5
Everything on the computer version is here!

Is pretty easy to figure out and has almost all features of website. Good show.
Version 2.5.5 2013-09-06 3
the app is ok for upcoming trips, but not at all for booking.  saved listings are not updating to the app, so it's useless for getting to them quickly.  love the service, just not this app.  if you want us to be able to use it on the go: while traveling, get it together please!
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-06 4
App works just as nicely as the website, well close enough. The only thing I seem not to be able to do with the app is work on extending reservations. Great for leaving feedback. Have so issues with it updating new content but that might be a server issue with the cell service.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-05 4
Brilliant app. Minus 1 star because pre entering travel dates doesn't correctly filter out booked listings.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-05 5
Love the company, love the app, and love how easy and fun it's made traveling. Airbnb has really ironed out any bugs they had in previous versions of the app and I have no complaints with this one. Cheers to revolutionizing the world of travel!
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-05 1
service is a good concept but the app has some problems. it doesnt seem to sync wishlists between the app and web site, or there is a delay. also, on many occasions i will search with a specified date range, and airbnb will show a low rate that is not accurate--it should automatically show you a final quote divided by nights excluding fees. also, there should be a way text message listing owners because sometimes theyre unresponsive--this could be carried out through the apl without revealing their phone numbers. and there should be a required criterion for listings that specifies minimum advance notice of a stay, so you dont risk getting declined if youre booking spontaneously. and there need to be more amenitiea requirements like on the site. oh, and there needs to be a push notification for guests as well as listing owners.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-04 4
Unique ideas, great layout. Love the themes. Don't always like the fees :/
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-04 5
Love it. Been such a lovely way to meet new people of different and similar interests.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-04 2

Airbnb is amazing. It's changed the way I travel. I give airbnb 10 stars out of 5. The app is awesome for travelers. It's too bad that it isn't as good for the hosts. The app is missing some key functionalities found on the website. This makes it impossible to manage reservations on iPads or iPhones. It's close, but we need another go at it. Honestly, the app should have any functionality that is a requirement for the search algorithm. That's the hurdle for an all-star Airbnb app. The service itself is amazing.
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-01 5
So far so goid
Version 2.6.1 2013-09-01 4
AirBnB is a necessity for any traveller/tourist, whether you travel every month, or once every 6 years!

As for the iPhone app itself, it's a great little app, but it is "little", compared to the website, in that it's difficult to navigate, and WAAAY oversimplified. Most mobile apps are starting to get too "dumbed down", to the point where they're becoming far too tedious to navigate, and sadly, this app, which is one of the best business ideas of our modern day, is using this trend...

The single-most way to improve the UI (in my opinion) is by having results pre-load, before you get to the last ones.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-31 5

I used airbnb to make a reservation in Miami. When my girlfriend and I land and get to the property excited to start our vacation we find that not only is our host not responding to calls or emails, the toilet isn't working and the room isn't cleaned. If that weren't enough, the power to the apartment goes out a few hours in and until we checked out in disgust twelve hours later still hasn't been turned back on. The property manager informed us that the power was off because our host had not paid any of his last bills. 

We understandably went to the website for a help contact number and started a claim. Or at least we tried to. We called four different times to speak to a claim manager so that we could get our money back and book a different hotel. Over twelve hours later and still no updates. This is with several "urgent" notations. I guess if you don't stress urgency they may get back to you within the decade.

I will never use this service again and I will vehemently persuade others to stay away.

Ok, I just started using this site less than a week ago and I already have one two day booking! Guests and hosts are pre-verified and they are both reviewed and come with references.  I love it.  And  $1,000,000 of insurance is supplied by AirBnB.  Anyway, I look forward to making a little extra money here and there through this fabulous site,

So fun to browse and super easy to use. I'm a huge fan of this app!
Version 2.6.1 2013-08-28 4
I use this app everyday managing my properties. My only complaint is the itinerary needs to note the amount of guests coming for the reservation,  so I know how many towels to have out or whether or not I need them to pay more. I'd also like to be able to see my reviews as they come so I don't have to login on a computer.  Just two pieces I hope their dev team considers.

I don't know how I ever traveled before Airbnb?! If you're like me and suffer from an incurable travel lust, this app is priceless.  In the times that I've used it, I've stayed in great apartments in good neighborhoods off the beaten path.
Version 2.6.1 2013-08-26 2
The idea of this app is brilliant... however, I have a serious problem with listers not responding to messages when you're trying to book a property. It has cost me several times to book a hotel due to lister inaccessability. The folks at Airbnb need to flush these people because it does reflect on their credibility. Sorry!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-25 5
I started to book through airbnb on my trip to Sri Lanka, so far I have found what seem to be nice places at a very reasonable price. I was so impressed I started hosting and within a few days my first guest came. A really nice couple stopping on their way home to Houston coming from Asia. This is so easy to use and the money I get from hosting may just cover the places I am staying in hosts abodes on my trip, a win win situation.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-25 1
Really irritated cuz I found an App I love and I can't use it? I want to post 5 stars!! Please Fix.
Version 2.5.6 2013-08-25 5
This app is easy to use and let me find a place where I wanted to be and within the price range that I wanted to be in.  Took a little bit to get used to the concept but I'm a user for life and won't  be booking hotels anymore when I've got this awesome app!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-24 1
The lowest "max" price I can enter is $114!  Say what?!!  On top of that silliness, the app won't let you filter by price.  So you have to scroll and scroll and scroll... Seriously lame.

We have rented many vacation rentals before. It is our preferred and recommended way to travel. This was our first experience booking on airbnb. Overall, it was fabulous. The nice thing about this site is the customer service, or middle man. They are working for both the host and guest. They are impartial and can therefore provide comfort that they will not take "sides". We did have to move from our initial rental into a new one because the amenities promised were not provided. Although it took a few days to get back to us after booking with another airbnb property (which is understandable) we did receive a full refund from the first place. My husband and I are planning at least one international vacation in the next year and we will absolutely be renting from this site.

Love the Airbnb service, but the app could be refined. First, on my iPhone 4, it keeps the GPS engaged which will eat up your entire battery in half a day. Second, I wish there was an easier way to search for specific type of properties instead of by location. For example if I wanted to find a cabin to rent within a few hours of my city, that's hard to do. Third, when searching within a specific city, it intermingles results from cities nearby which makes it difficult to only look at that specific city's properties.

Version 2.6.0 2013-08-13 5
I absolutely love AirBnb, I have had nothing but wonderful hosts for every place that I have visited. As a solo female traveler I feel very comfortable and safe booking rooms on this site. Also, I love that I have the opportunity to go beyond the touristy hotels and really learn the places that I visit because the hosts are usually locals of the area. Super easy layout to book rooms and you've saved me a lot of money. Thanks AirBnB for helping me see the world!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-13 5
We have been using Airbnb as hosts and guests for a couple months and we are loving it!
Version 2.5.6 2013-08-13 5
Enabled us to make some extra cash to travel.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-13 4
I love Airbnb and this app is not only easy to use, it has become the primary way for me to manage my vacation rental. It is so helpful!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-12 5
This app is phenomenal. I'm going to Europe this month and with this website I was able to book unbelievable places in different countries and cities.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-12 5
Used it for the first time!! And will never use anything else ever again
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-11 4
This app makes managing my AirBnB listings incredibly convenient. I would likely not participate in this site without it. Some glitches come up from time to time, and it will shut down without warning. But it still gets the job done when I need it to.
Version 2.5.6 2013-08-11 5
This app is a must-have if traveling and staying at air BnB accommodations. So useful and makes it very convenient to communicate wit hosts.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-11 5
Great app for a great service!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-11 5
So far so good
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-11 2
I use Facebook a lot to market my studio, I cannot login with Facebook account, it keeps giving me the server error message.  Please take a look!  Otherwise, it would have been a five app!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-11 3
I think this app could be well more comprehensive.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-10 5
Airbnb is a really well run company. The user interface of their website is easy to run manage and the app is no different. I manage 8 rental properties in Atlanta and I can use this app to manage all of my bookings mobiley. That's quite remarkable of you think about it.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-09 1
No long support Passbook
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-09 4
I use this app every day and love it. This version seems to crash on launch for me though. But once I open the app a second time, everything is fine.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-09 5
Love the app and its even more fun to make a wish list and share your favorite listings with friends to talk about over coffee, etc.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-09 2
I don't know what app all of the five star reviewers are using, but it must not be the same as mine. You can't: save favorites (heart icon does not exist in app), drag $$ slider below $110 per night, and it's hard to drag anywhere at that, you can't filter by any amenities such as high speed Internet, pet friendly, laundry, etc, and all of the information on each listing is so basic as to be a waste of time. This is clearly a website that works best on a desktop or laptop. I give the mobile airbnb websites on phones, iPads and the app itself a combined 3 out of 10.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-08 5
This app is great! It makes communicating with guests is made FAST and simple. Get it!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-08 2
I am a host and this new version is NOT transferring property description.  Airbnb website also needs a troubleshooting contact point.  I had to phone to report the problem and the customer service person was not helpful at all with troubleshooting question
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-07 5
Airbnb is great!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-07 4
Great app but in the latest update the "add to passbook" button no longer works and shows "directions" instead (yes, just like the directions button below it). Please fix.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-07 5
I am totally in love with this concept and app. So much cheaper than hotels and you can pay how you want for the most part ( debit card vs major credit card and the security deposit hold blah blah blah). 
I have traveled so much more and met some really cool connects on the way.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-06 5
What a great app and it is so nice to have on the fly. Works very well with my Passbook too and gives me a quick reference to pull from when in a hurry!!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-06 5
Changes the way you travel, excellent App
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-05 4
Very well done on the iPhone... Now what I'd love would be a dedicated iPad version, much better for browsing places.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-05 5
A really great company and app, I used it for my entire summer to find prime locations to stay at!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-05 5
Really easy app to use and I love the layout
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-05 4
I love AirBnB and I love this app! It's incredibly easy to use. I wish we were able to make changes to the Wish List via the app, but it's not a deal breaker. Highly recommend.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-05 3
Most of basic stuff can get done with this app, except 1) edit your ad, 2) alter daily rates, currency, or claim issues if you're a host. 

Developers should definitely make it work the same as the website.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-04 1
I would rate the app much higher except I was unable to complete the verification process (I could not verify my phone number, and all attempts to contact Airbnb were unsuccessful), therefor I was unable to complete the booking, and had to revert to other options.

P.S. I tried to use the web version to complete the process or contact Airbnb and and still no success.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-04 5
Amazing.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-04 2
Good interface, but I can never see the price listed when I search for a place. Price shows up no problem when I use the mobile site
Version 2.5.6 2013-08-03 5
Are u friendly and have extra space at  your house ? Use Airbnb :)
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-03 5
I can run my entire rental from this app alone! It's so intuitive and easy to use. I thought I would have to use my desktop most of the time but after downloading this app I rarely find myself logging on from my home computer.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-02 5
This app has been a true diamond on my new travel adventures! Love it! Thank you!
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-02 1
Nice UI, but lacking the ability to filter by amenities.   That's really weak.   Missing that major feature makes this app almost unusable.
Version 2.5.6 2013-08-02 5
Great job with this app!  It's really easy to use.
Version 2.6.0 2013-08-01 1
I love airbnb. But I hate this app. I've been using airbnb to rent out my apartment when I travel which is every 2 months or so, and I like to be able to change the rate on my apartment to be competitive. It is next to impossible to change the rate on this app for certain days, and they never show you how much you could potentially get from an inquiry. I literally log in every time to the desktop version of airbnb on safari on my iPhone, it's much more user friendly even if a few more extra steps. I feel like people who wrote the 5 star reviews must not need to know the amount of $ a reservation can add up to or never change their price, or aren't actually people that use this app... Step up your game airbnb!
Version 2.5.6 2013-08-01 5
"This is the business of the year."
In quotes is the pre-text put in by apple or airbnb and I cannot disagree. This is my favorite business of the year. I have met awesome people, made money, and vacationed in Mexico on it. BUSINESS OF THE YEAR.
Version 2.6.0 2013-07-31 5
I really enjoy this app. It is easy to use and allowed me to communicate with the owner of the property where we were staying, since we didn't bring our laptop. I highly recommend this!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-31 5
I love Airbnb! It was just what I was looking for when I decided to rent out my houses. I have met great people and it has helped me financially as well. I really appreciate the team behind Airbnb... They are great and helpful!
Version 2.6.0 2013-07-31 5
Nice
Version 2.6.0 2013-07-31 5
So good and awesome app
Version 2.6.0 2013-07-30 5
Love the interface.
Version 2.6.0 2013-07-30 5
I LOVE AirBnB and I love this app.  I can run my entire little cottage rental business from this app. I also have a competitors app that I use from time to time but I find this app far superior.
It's also fast. Efficient. I love it!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-30 5
I love the mobile app! Works really well, kept all the reservation info handy for me. We rented a fabulous apartment with great owners. Excellent experience all the way around.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-30 5
We LOVE Airbnb app. While traveling we could easily find hosts and a map showing where places were available. It is great!!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-30 5
An awesome app - try it for your next getaway - you won't regret it!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-29 5
Simply great!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-29 5
I already used airbnb few times and i was happy with an app as well as with the whole idea of renting places.
Happy to recommend!!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-29 5
Love love love this app. Totally easy to use and great to have with you when traveling.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-29 3
Have used this company many times to find great places to stay while on vacation but the app is missing a lot of features for hosting a place such as setting price.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-28 1
when attempting to update listing with new pix from an iOS device, you must take pix at that moment. no support for pix saved for uploading within app. are you listening airbnb?!

July 28, 2013 update: airbnb continues to ignore basic and common-sense bug and usability fixes with their iOS app! it's extremely frustrating, and despite repeated calls and discussions, no return phone calls to address or fix the issues. we are going to begin moving our listing to two competing services out of sheer frustration. airbnb: don't do anything to change, we know you won't anyway!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-27 5
Airbnb is a fantastic way to find accommodations when you travel. The app works well and is very consumer friendly.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-27 5
This is hands down my favorite app of all time!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-27 5
I use this all the time to respond to inquiries faster, set my calendar availability, approve instant bookings, etc.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-27 5
Traveling alone or with company the AirBNB app makes traveling a breeze. Cheaper pricing than most hotels with all the ease of staying at home. Depending on your comfort level you can share a room, stay in a private room, or rent a whole place. The app even tells you if dogs are welcome! It is so easy to use and helpful!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-26 5
Makes the already great AirBnB experience even better.  I would just suggest a better layout for the menu.  It's not overly confusing but could be better.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-25 5
Highly visual, intuitive--just a great app and a great service. I DO feel like wish list functionality should be beefed up, and hey, why not a native iPad version!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-24 4
It's not as comprehensive as the online computer version. But it is fantastic enough to spend 2hrs at a time on planning your next spectacular trip
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-24 5
I am a host and I use the app to manage everything. Even when I'm traveling people send me messages for reservation and I never miss it! There is a reason why my response rate is 100%!!
As a traveller too, I can find any accommodation on the road. Hardly any bugs!
The only thing I would want is to manage your calendar feature in the app as a host 

Great tool!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-24 5
I love Airbnb, & the app makes using it even better. As a hostess, I know I am always available to respond thanks to this app!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-23 5
I've used AirBnb 4 times in the last 3 months. It's a great way to find MORE space for LESS money. I stayed in a 2-bedroom house in San Fran, less than a mile from the beach in the Sunset District, for less than a basic hotel room in the city. Great deals from great people. I'll be using this service again and again!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-23 3
As a host, I wish my calendar was easier to view and access. Also, when I'm responding to messages, I need to be able to see the message I'm responding too. Often, a guest has several questions and ill have to copy what I have, go back to read the question, then return and paste my original response. Overall the app is super helpful, but doesn't feel like it was built for hosts first.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-23 5
This app is such a cool idea.
A really great way to connect with others and get insider tips on the area you are visiting from your host.
Super affordable way to travel; never feel ripped off by a hotel again!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-23 5
The airbnb app is very easy to use and fast. It makes the business perfect. Thanks.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-22 2
I've had several problems with iOS device on this app...
Once, I was in Germany and I decided to stay somewhere and for some reason not only it gave me the wrong address but it also didn't let me know about the extra fee since I was with my wife.
Than now I have an issue with notification center and it's not Apple problem like you've mentioned a few time. It doesn't save the settings on in your app where I wanna be notified on my iphone the second I get a message from somebody! And for that reason I've missed a few people!
Thanks for fixing it!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-22 2
I couldn't find a way to click to cancel through the app. ( i could understand if it's because you want to protect again people using the app to find places and not paying for the hook up) BUT If you have booking remorse you still have to call someone to do it for you if you aren't near a computer and if you haven't gone to the place to check it out first, they will encourage you to do that. I'm sorry, with people padding their online reviews left and right these days I want to have the right to back out of a deal quickly if a place isn't quite what it's made out to be! ( I don't want to have to go there just to make sure it does in deed "smell of smoke and urine" as some two weeks older but now buried reviews stated) I ended up eating the booking because the place had a "flexible" but no short notice refunding policy... Makes we wonder how many other people may have run into similar situations... booked and canceled which then null and voids their right to review a place.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-22 5
My husband and I just spent a week in this Brooklyn apt. next to Prospect Park,  across the street from a subway station. We rented a room from Lincoln/Phillip, and it was quiet, clean, & comfortable.  Lucille
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-22 4
The only reason this isn't a five-star review is for two reasons:
1) Ideally a rep would contact a new listing owner and give tips to get the most out of it and explain more on how to capitalize this opportunity. I feel lost and not sure if I'm doing it right. No bites on my listing. Is it price or verbiage? I don't know. 

2) There needs to be an Edit button on the photos page to pivot portrait style photos to landscape. The program does not allow for imported portrait style pics to be pivoted. Seems simple enough to solve on the back end. 

Otherwise, this concept is amazing.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-21 5
After being diagnosed with cancer and being told I can't work, I was devastated. I found Airbnb and signed up it has saved me. Gave me the ability to support myself during kemo and next month surgery.  I love hosting people and i met the most awesome people. If it wasn't for Airbnb I don't know where I would be now.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-21 3
The app is almost there to perfection. It can handle basic reservation requests and approve or deny and basic messaging to the guest or host. However it's missing the following:
- ability for the host to call the guest from the app, I can only do this on full desktop version which is annoying when I'm out on the road. 
- no ability to adjust the price in my calendar
- no ability to adjust my profile description 

It's almost a home run app, but I guess it's better than nothing. For what one can do on the app its great! So thank you airbnb!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-21 3
Seriously need iPad version.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-19 5
Very user friendly, and finds great deals! Very reliable too! 
My boyfriend and I were looking for a place together in TLV and were not the richest kids on the planet, it appears. When we found this app it made my life so much easier with finding the perfect place for us by the beach for a great price! These are amazing findings and I never thought it'd be this easy to pinpoint them. Now I can go about y traveling with the option of not pulling out thousands of dollars on a place to stay. Thanks airbenb!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-18 5
Best way to travel for my family. Will always check AirBnB first!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-17 5
I've been an AirBNB host in Beverly Hills, CA for 6 years. The hundreds of guests I've had the pleasure of hosting has enriched my life immensely. I have gotten to know people from every continent..... Privileged travelers that want a more personal experience, young budget-minded travelers, honeymooners, future Angelino's wanting a home base while seeking their new place to live, business travelers that can't stand the thought of one more hotel, medical patients recuperating after coming to Cedars-Sinai for treatment from one of their many fine doctors.  There are couples, straight, gay, seniors, first-time travelers, young lovers. I look forward to a trip to Spain & Portugal this year to use AirBNB as a guest. I can't wait!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-16 3
Everything is null and 0$ in iOS 7 beta 1,2,and 3
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-16 4
I love AirBnB and really like the app. Two things I wish we're available: profile editing and viewing past reservations. I talk this service up everywhere I travel and I'd love to be able to show people photos and descriptions of places I've already stayed.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-16 5
Love this app. Love that we found it through a friend and we can't wait to use it again in upcoming trips!!  Our experience in Austin, TX was out of this world awesome
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-15 5
My wife and I are traveling through Europe and this app has saved us hours of searching and loads of money. Great, intuitive app. I like that there are multiple ways to find a place, especially with the map & pins.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-15 5
Airbnb is my go-to site for vacation housing.. Now the app makes it easier for me to view offerings while I'm on the go.. That's a win in my book!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-15 4
Awesome!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-15 1
I love Airbnb but I have iPhone 5 and the app has not worked for some time time now. :(
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-15 1
Ever since I installed(and keep reinstalling) the newest version, all it does is crash. Very irritated!!!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-13 5
I refer everyone who shares their upcoming travel plans to airbnb. I'm a big fan!!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-12 5
App makes it easy to find places to stay and has tons of information about the hosts and reviews on the properties in easy to find and simply presented.
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-12 5
I believe it is a great app and a great idea similar to Facebook!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-12 5
Easy to navigate and very useful. I will never use VRBO again!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-11 5
I love it! Seeing options around the world with my phone? Doesn't get any better than that!
Version 2.5.6 2013-07-11 5
Love The Properties they offer, their customer  service is exceptional, we have used air bnb twice and could not have been more satisfied!! I have been recommending this site to everyone I know is going on vacation!
Version 2.5.5 2013-06-01 5
I love Airbnb's app. The interface is clean and easy to use. I communicate with all my guests through the app and it is very simple. I have been using Airbnb for over a year now as a host and a guest and I love the company as well as the app.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-31 1

No problems, just solutions.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-31 1
The App crashes everytime I try opening it on my phone. It hasn't been jailbroken or anything so it has been working fine, but suddenly it doesn't work.

App support - please look into it.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-31 1
App never loads. Crashes every time it's opened.

Crashing every time after opening it. Please fix! Otherwise good app.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-31 1
I wanted to like it but I could only get it to open once.  Crash and burn every other time. No developer info so who do I contact?  IPhone 5 & latest iOs version.
Sorry, but this needs some work to get to stable release.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-31 1
The app won't open on the iPhone 5. It crashes immediately every time. I wrote to the Airbnb and they recommended I use the desktop version.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-31 1
Downloaded this app today to prepare for a summer trip. All it does is crash. Epic fail! Delete!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-31 1
Won't even open.

The app crashes upon loading on BOTH my iPhone 4 and my iPhone 5.
Please fix.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-30 5
Great app and amazing product.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-30 5
Great app! Easy to use, secured, no fuss, and most importantly, the hosts and the properties have been checked out by AIRBNB. This is the best way to get great accommodation at a great price. And staying with the hosts helps you make friends!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-30 5
App is easy to use !! Easy access to a home away from home!! Will use again;)
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-29 3
This app is missing practical features essential for hosts. For example, there is no way to manage your inbox (delete messages) or check your account ($) details- i.e. past and future payments. I also suggest giving the option to NOT leave a review for someone without having that distracting notification number just sitting there forever. This last suggestion may seem trivial to some, but as a busy host I find the notification alert a useful reminder. However, having it there permanently nullifies this otherwise convenient function. Thank you.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-29 5
Use it all the time. Not as many features as the main site but great. On the iPad you have to enlarge the app to make it bigger.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-29 5
Entertaining, fun and useful to find places to stay world wide. 
Apartments, houses, villas, lofts, everything you could imagine.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-28 4
We went to Orlando for memorial weekend found a great deal with Airbnd. The apartment was clean, great deal, t was what it shows on the picture . The transaction went very easy
I love it

Airbnb is a fantastic company and service and their app is a total pleasure to use!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-27 5
Used Airbnb for the first time on a recent international trip. The property management company we booked with were excellent and helpful, and the entire process was smooth. Highly recommend for a visit outside of tradition/all-inclusive hotels
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-27 5
Before 2011 I will stay at hotels who would just eat my money and left me with no experience but only the experience of paying extra for everything you asked, consumed, touch, etc. In my opinion a traveler is nothing without wifi.. We need it to communicate with our friends/family, for general info about the surroundings where we are staying etc. Since I discovered airbnb my EXPERIENCE when traveling has never been the same. Trust me it would change the way you travel! Expect for you "fancy" people who don't like to experience $h*t (w/ all due respect)
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-26 5
I love this App!!!
Version 2.2.2 2013-05-26 5
This app makes it easy to be in communication with our renters.  Great tool!
Version 2.5.3 2013-05-25 5
Greatttttt
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-25 5
Thank you so much to the creators of such a great App! Now I can travel easier and also can earn some money renting my space!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-25 5
Made my trip to Paris on airbnb, was really great!
Version 2.5.1 2013-05-25 5
Wish I'd thought of this concept. We booked a great place in Chicago. Owner was fantastic to work with and the condo was perfectly located, close to family. Love the pics on the app. Gets me excited about our upcoming travels because I know we'll have tons of options to consider.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-24 5
This app is fantastic. I've stayed at 4 residences now sight unseen and thanks to honest review from other users I've had *excellent experiences on my travel adventures. The app runs so smoothly and allows you to do business right from your phone or iPad. Very well recommended for anyone seeking a reliable company to help you find a place to stay while abroad!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-23 5
Best website ever invented! Way better than hotels. I haven't looked at one since I started with Airbnb!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-22 5
This is awesome.

Easy to navigate, clear app. Good photos and options for searching a place to stay. Lots of availability to stay in most cities. Looking forward to trying to host & make some $$!

Easy to navigate.

This app is a lifesaver and gives me the opportunity to respond immediately to my guest requests!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-21 1
App always crashes on iPhone 4S with iOS 6.1.3 up date.
Version 2.5.3 2013-05-21 5
The airbnb app has made traveling all over the world so much easier!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-20 1
I love airbnb, but whenever I try to open the app it crashes every single time. I've deleted and reinstalled it a few times. Same thing. Airbnb please fix !!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-20 5
We love to host people. A great way to meet travelers and earn some money!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-20 5
It work great, the application works great on my phone. I'm very happy.
It's fast and private.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-20 5
Last minute trip????   PERFECT SITE!!!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-20 5
This service makes hosting a breeze. It basically runs your business for you. I get a text whenever an inquiry or booking comes my way. I can log into the phone app and accept, decline or email for additional info. I can route payouts to more than one account. And they have great customer support!  Really all you need to do is take a few great pictures of your place, come up with your pricing, update your listing and voila. Just sit back and enjoy your bookings.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-20 5
Best thing to happen to travel since airplanes.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-20 5
Best way to stay in great places!!! Love this app
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-19 4
Airbnb is an awesome service. The mobile app is good too, though I wish it was a bit more full-featured. For instance, I wanted to view/edit my reviews (since I'm traveling and don't have my laptop of course!) but seemed like I couldn't do that. Also the app failed to save my review after I submitted it so I had to write it all over again.

Overall I've had so much fun traveling through airbnb, looking forward to my next trip!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-19 5
Airbnb isn't just an app it's a community. There's no better way to get the most value for your money when traveling.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-19 5
I usedit at the wifi spots in Italy to book all of my stays. Worked great! 

I even used Otto write quick reviews while on the go.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-19 5
Really user friendly interface.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-18 4
Easy to use for the already amazing airbnb service. Everything you need is right in your hand.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-18 5
So nice to be able to sit around and book new guests through the app. Doesn't have all the site features but it has matured nicely for most of what hosts need.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-18 5
Love this app! Love Airbnb! Love being a host!
Version 2.2.2 2013-05-17 5
Airbnb offers a great alternate for people to have unique travel options and not stuck with the same hotel chains...
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-17 5
Superb app!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-16 5
Good app for finding place to stay
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-16 5
Airbnb provides every type of traveler, business and leisure, with the perfect app to find a GREAT place to stay. From hotels & small apartment to mansions & castles, Airbnb has it all. Whatever your budget, whatever your preference Airbnb has you covered. The best part is that they VERIFY you to make sure no creepers stay in any of their places. Also, reviews can only be made by people who have actually stayed in one of their places so there are no false reviews...EVER.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-16 5
An excellent app. Makes traveling so much more easy and pleasant. I've made new friends and stayed in many interesting places since finding this app.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-16 4
But need to improve host friendliness. Managing listing, settings, calendar pricing, and all that good stuff. 

Sometimes the desktop version on safari doesn't work.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-16 5
Quick and easy way to manage my listing!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-16 5
Great way to browse listings & keep up w/ communications. I use this app frequently to stay in touch w guests & potential guests :)
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-15 5
The best app to ever happen to a new traveler. Yay!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-15 4
never spend a vacation in a boring hotel ever again!!

really fabulous selection of properties. only gripe is some of the facebook sharing seems to be broken...
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-15 5
I started using Airbnb in 2010 when it was widely unknown. Skeptical and very, very nervous whether is was legit or not, I booked my stays all through Europe because it seemed more personal and cost far less than hotels or hostels. When my group and I arrived in England at midnight I was sweating, holding onto hope it wasn't to good to be true. Now 3 years later I am more confident than ever with success in every rental I've booked (I hope I don't jinx myself). I recommend it to everyone who asks me how I save money traveling. I am sure people have horror stories but I love Airbnb!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-15 5
Beautiful and very user friendly, in depth information at my fingertips. The app itself is perfect for someone on the go.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-14 1
A terrible terrible service. Greedy company wouldn't cancel my reservation until midnight the day I arrived even with no contact from the host for a month, leaving me to book a hotel at premium prices the day of. The service staff doesn't know anything except what they can Google (for example, where the booking was physically located) and were rude to boot.  After they couldn't reach the host they posted a fake review in my name on their site indicating that *I* had cancelled the reservation the day before I arrived. Spent hours waiting at the premise and ran up $50 in roaming fees talking to their service staff for nothing. No thank you, never again. The company gives you a false sense of security by taking you money directly, but really all they do is take control out of your hands to resolve issues yourself and their only interest is collecting their fee.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-14 3
For hosts its kind of a pain that you can't see the total for an inquiry. And when you go to your calendar you can't see what your rates are, so I've had to call Airbnb every time I want to respond to a guest with a special offer, since I can't see the calculated total anywhere!

Otherwise.... It's a simple app and pretty intuitive. I Just want all the same info as the website, please.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-13 5
Great app and service!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-13 5
Perfect idea & excellent application
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-13 4
As a host, I love having everything on my iPhone. But full editing capability just isn't there. For instance, I can't find the method or button to sync calendars between iPhone and app.  Otherwise, good job. Probably better for traveller than host.
Version 2.5.0 2013-05-13 4
I enjoy the app but there really should be a way to view the Itinerary from the calendar view.
Version 2.2.3 2013-05-12 4
Found great places to stay...a few bugs but works amazingly well overall...
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-12 5
Luv it
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-11 5
Airbnb is a great website
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-10 3
You really need an iPad or Universal version of your app!

Any plans?
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-10 5
I love how easy this is to use and how reviews, photographs and payment is being taken care of. I had great locations all the way through and can recommend this App to everyone who loves to travel!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-09 5
I love the app
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-08 4
This is a great way to have AirBnB at your fingertips. I do which it had more if the web based features like my reservations for bookings but I'm sure that will be soon.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-08 1
Air does not work.  Worst app ever.  Get used to seeing "an unknown error has occurred". Unreliable is a terrible feature for an app used to book travel arrangements.
Version 2.5.4 2013-05-08 5
Through Airbnb we've stayed with loads of great people all over the place. We'll be using this to plan our next big trip!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-07 5
This is the best recommendation ever!!
It was an awesome experience!!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-07 5
We love Airbnb and recommend it to all our friends.  It is a friendly adventure each time we have stayed through Airbnb!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-07 5
Fantastic!! Use it not only to book a place while traveling but also a great way to get new ideas on design.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-07 5
Pretty much the ONLY way to travel!!!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-07 5
Great idea. Already used it and was very happy!
Version 2.5.4 2013-05-06 5
Very well designed app - easy to browse through all the interesting housing offers worldwide. Nice touches for getting in touch with your host via
Email or a convenient button to call then. Keep track of open reservations and favorites. Snappy and intuitive in delivering up pics and videos of the properties. Wish all apps were so easy to use!
Version 2.5.4 2013-05-06 4
Overall a great tool and pretty easy to use. Based on personal nature of this service, would like ability to filter based on gender of roommates. (My wife and I might be uncomfortable if I were to stay with a single woman.)  

Would also like to be able to remove properties and delete messages from my inbox.  That way, if I choose to reject a place, it doesn't keep showing up again. Just the opposite of the favorites list. 

Overall a really useful app.
Version 2.5.3 2013-05-05 5
Brilliant app keeps you connected while away from you desk!
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-05 5
Pretty much the only a I travel now!
Version 2.5.4 2013-05-05 5
I love airbnb, and the app is fantastic! It allows hosts to instantly reply to potential guests which is a big plus in getting reservations. Great concept!
Version 2.5.3 2013-05-05 2
Amazing idea, great dot com, great visual design, worst ux for an app I have seen In a while. Unreliable, inconvenient and un-befitting of such an awesome company.
Version 2.5.4 2013-05-05 5
Updated after trip.   Love love love this app!  Made my first travel arrangements and looking forward to it!!  Well, I traveled and just got back and was thrilled with my experience!  I can't wait to book another place with airbnb!  Awesome service and app is great way to stay I touch with travel plans when no computer available;)
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-04 5
With great features and easy search filters
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-03 5
Awesome app saved me tons of money and still had a great place to stay ... Its like home away from home. 

Just freaking awesome ... I was stupid not to try this before .. From now on this is how i book a place to stay ... 

Thank you for whoever made this app
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-03 3
the idea is cool, but it is not convenient at all. one could browse the apartment, and write messages only. it's a headache to manage one's listing, to make changes.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-03 5
My new favorite thing.  That is all.
Version 2.5.5 2013-05-03 4
I haven't used the app very much on my phone, but I was able to message easily  the people I need to contact.
So far I love airbnb.
Version 2.5.4 2013-05-02 1
App used to be ideal.....however now App crashes each time I attempt to accept a reservation request.  Please fix this bug ASAP.
Version 2.5.4 2013-05-01 5
Such a great experience. :)
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-29 4
Awesome inventional app, with every resources in the palm of your hand, literally. Good.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-29 5
Great for hosts--so helpful.
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-29 3
The app is fabulous, but the bugs make it counterproductive. When attempting to accept a reservation, the app closes, so I have to log into the mobile site anyway. Please repair it.
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-29 5
Love this App it really makes it easy to manage my reservations!
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-28 1
With this version I can't accept reservations without the app crashing. I don't know when I'll have computer access next, so my request will likely expire due to this bug. This app could really use a dashboard because the notifications are also broken and will still show up as new even though I looked at them multiple times. Fix this!
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-27 5
This app gives all the convenience and accessibility of the website in the palm of your hand. The alerts are so nice when communicating with hosts!
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-26 4
Have me so many options,, even greater than I first thought.
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-26 5
This website is just what the 20th century needs! The app could be a bit simpler but it's still great
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-26 4
Great App! Even when I don't really plan a trip, I like to look through houses/apartments for designing purposes. Should definitely  include the mileage radius and specific requests. For example if I'm looking for a place with indoor pool I want to be able to filter all of the other places out. Other ways very handy app!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-26 5
Great app. It has given me not just great guests but made great friends from it. All over the world. Strongly recommended .
Version 2.5.1 2013-04-25 5
Its amazing and friendly
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-25 5
Easy accessible.
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-24 2
New version crashes when attempting to accept a reservation request
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-24 5
The next big thing!! Hotels are out.. Vacation rentals are in.. Value x3 .. AirBnB is a revolution.
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-23 3
This program was pretty neat. 

But with this version, it won't launch at all. 

iPhone 5. 
Always at latest version of iOS. 

Ps: hard to know how to rate.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-23 5
Awesome app and awesome service!
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-23 2
Can't accept reservations...
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-23 2
Great app but as a host you can't accept reservation since last update.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-23 5
This is the best app I've ever used! I'm staying in beautiful homes in the best areas of Paris and Florence for a fraction of the cost!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-22 5
Airbnb makes traveling much more fun and personal.  Highly recommend this app.  It works great!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-22 5
Airbnb goes with me to anyplace at anytime. It keep me on total contact and on call to be there if my guest need me. Efficiency and reliability must be mandatory, also a true love for hosting.
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-22 5
Airbnb is very user friendly, affordable, easy to get to better than any hotel
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-21 5
Having the Airbnb app on my iPhone has really made it easy to respond to new reservation requests quickly. It alerts me with a distinct tone, and I instantly know someone is requesting a stay. I can read the inquiry, accept, deny, or ask for more information, check my calendar, and even make a special offer if I choose to. This app saves me so much time, and it works perfectly. The guests appreciate the rapid response, and my reservations get accepted more often because of it.
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-20 4
This app is easy to search and browse with. I wish there was an iPad version. Some enhancements I would like to see are support for rotating the phone into horizontal mode, and the ability to zoom in on pictures and text.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-20 5
So easy and actually fun to use! It has features that make your travels so easy. Couldn't ask for better
Version 2.5.4 2013-04-20 5
Even easier than the web version, very user friendly!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-10 5
Just finished my third stay with an Airbnb host and LOVED it! You have such variety to choose from wherever you go! The prices are usually the same or better than a hotel and often for an entire place! I love this app!! So easy to use!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-08 5
New member and so far I love it!! A few of my friends found out about this app all at the same time and none of us can stop looking at all the great potential world destinations to visit. Have recommended it to many people.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-08 5
Live this app. You could literally see the world on a frugal budget and not give up safety, cleanliness and location.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-08 5
This app and site is amazing! So easy to use and so much better than booking at hotels, where you get less for more money! I recommend to anyone who loves to travel!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-08 5
I never have to use the website...and being someone who travels..that is a huge plus!
Version 2.5.1 2013-04-07 5
Not sure what the previous reviewers are talking about. I've had no trouble with this app and booked my reservation seamlessly. I was able to look at all info and contact information. It's super convenient. I don't have to login every time either... Anyways, love the app- but most important adore Airbnb!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-07 4
Overall a good app. My only complaint is the inability to update a reservation via the app; one must go to the full site for that, which is a hassle.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-07 1
If I can give negative stars I would. I have had many problems with this app including not getting emails and my accepting reservations not going through.  I called AirBnB customer service and they said "Don't use the app it's not made by us. Use our website instead. This app is known for issues."  Could have fooled me that the app wasn't made by AirBnB so don't download the app says AirBnB customer service because it's buggy as heck.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-07 3
Some people think this is the place to review airbnb as such, but this is not the case. These reviews are meant for the app only. That being said, despite the large number of updates, the app still misses the mark on a couple fronts. The first and most egregious is the fact that unlike most (non-bank related) apps, you have to log-in every single time you want to use it. This seems like a small matter, but can get annoying when you have multiple guests/inquiries and use the app a lot. Second - when you try to send messages to guests, often the message disappears when you hit send and does not actually send. If you don't think to save the message first as a safety, you'll have to recompose it. 
As a side note, airbnb itself is awesome! We are hosting more than ever and loving it.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-06 5
I love airbnb! I don't think I will ever stay in a hotel! Or actually before I go anywhere I will definitely check places to stay before any hotel!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-05 5
This app helps keep me informed about new inquiries and respond on the go, as they happen. I believe I've been able to secure many of my new bookings because of this app. It's easy to use and looks good too.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-05 5
Love it! So easy and convenient. I'll never stay at a hotel again! AirBNB is where it's at!!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-04 5
Wow in 2 months I had people from 8 counties visit and stay with me airbnb I love u I live on a remote island in the Caribbean Vieques puerto Rico come visit me too
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-04 5
I hope there is also an app for iPad.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-03 5
Besides the fact that everything works, is the background idea that rules Airbnb, the experience of getting to know people and places is remarkable!!! Nice to see and remember that great things happens trough tech!!!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-03 5
Last minute trip to London and Rome and literally within 15 minutes of looking and messaging, two great places. I pray fraudsters/commercial companies don't figure out how to exploit this great community.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-03 5
First things first, Airbnb has to be one of the few trusted sites i have used. 
Customer service is great and there is a 24/7 service and online assistance to avoid headaches. 

I am a college student abroad in Europe and Airbnb has helped me travel to places at ease, w/o having to worry about booking a hostel and such. 

This application is very handy. I rarely go on my Macbook and book places anymore, its super easy to use and recommend everyone! 

Happy booking!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-03 5
This app lets me find houses/condos that are surprisingly cheap to rent if going on vacation and you want more privacy than staying at a huge hotel with lots of ppl. Its awesome having the pool to yourself with your fam :)
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-02 5
Great!!!
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-02 5
Great App design. Have been using Airbnb for short and long term stays. Great alternative to expensive hotels. Have met many nice people during our travels. Highly recommended.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-02 5
5 stars for ease of use, intuitive design, and highly recommendable.
Version 2.5.3 2013-04-02 5

The most legit thing out since the "text message"

Great place to find a great place
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-23 5
Great app. It have some things that you can't do like in the computer but is a msut have.
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-22 5
This site (I've used only the iPhone app, which is flawless).. is fully customized, positioned for growth, and done very, very well..

When will you guys be going public? Haha
Version 2.5.0 2013-03-21 2
I have been using AirBB for traveling, short term rentals and even as discovery app. I was one of the first members and I always believe in it's potentials.

Unfortunately AirBB it is not anymore a tool to connect private users throughout the world, it became the Disneyland of real estate brokers. 
Now a good 60% of the users are actually professional brokers who will want your fee on top of airBB fee.

What was a wonderful way to reach new friends and new places, became a new Craigslist. 
Do a little search! Try Tokyo, New York.. you'll se that many apts are advertised by the same person.
This person is a broker who will ask you to pay his fee (on top of airBB fee and daily rental).
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-20 4
This app is easy to use on the go. I needed a room ASAP and used it and within 30 mins had paid and secured a room. There are some aspects of this app that are slow. The emails update a bit too slow.
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-20 5
A cost effective way to bring humanity back into the world.
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-19 5
I only use this for places to stay when traveling
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-19 5
This app is very useful if u love traveling
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-19 1
App doesn't let you log in via Facebook, which is how I log in on the web.
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-19 5
works great
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-18 5
I love the variety and the cool places you can stay!
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-17 4
My husband and I stayed in this amazing tree house on the Big Island of Hawaii after finding and booking it on this app. 
I love Airbnb, however the app is a little glitchy/slow on the iPhone 4S. It's fun to browse the app, but the website is much more efficient for booking.
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-16 5
Amazingly perfect.
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-16 4
Love the App but there are some quirks and things you can't do on it that you can do from the website (like refer friends).

Also, be aware that there is a SERVICE FEE ADDED to tenants' bill AFTER booking. It's hidden until you've booked. Not nice.
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-16 3
I've been using the App for a few weeks and its super easy.  I mainly use it right now to check emails from potential renters.  However, I wish it had a better calendar system on it so I can check the availability of my rental down the road.  That's ultimately why I'm giving this app a 3-star rating.
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-16 5
The app is amazing. The company is amazing. Great way to travel. Great way to make some $.
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-16 5
Great app to have if you like to travel! It's fun to browse and if you do have a trip planned its nice to have the stay info accessible from the app. I used it a ton on my trip to Puerto Rico
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-15 5
This is a great app. Does everything it should. Very user friendly. And we love airbnb!
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-15 5
I was new to the airbnb concept, downloaded Ap to iPhone, searched properties for dates I needed, contacted host, negotiated a price, and booked the property ... all from my iPhone using the Ap!  Great service, easy to use and intuitive Ap!  You won't regret using either!
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-14 5
I love to travel but don't always have the funds to do it as much as I'd like. Airbnb is great for finding places that fit my budget. The app is incredibly easy to use. Pictures are accurate as well. Love!
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-14 5
Airbnb has really done their homework on this one.  Perfect!
Version 2.5.3 2013-03-14 3
The places on airbnb look great, but the host takes a while to reply sometimes. Some have never replied. One should not post their place if they don't plan on replying. The places I have stayed are very nice and well kept.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-14 4
This app is amazing! Allows you to search and use filters to find the results you are looking for! Also, it keeps you in constant touch with the owners. Wonderful! I just wish I could specify a desired neighborhood. That's my ONLY con!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-13 5
Love Airbnb and have had a great experience using the app.
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-13 4
I like the AirBnb idea and service a lot! and I like the App because it helps me being efficient in replying also when I'm traveling or I don't have my laptop with me. Keep on improving it ;-) Awesome job guys!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-13 5
This app is great. It makes an already convenient website even more accessible. You can access all your bookings, contact hosts, and even book and pay for new trips on the app. Never crashes and very simple to navigate.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-13 5
Can't find the payment tracking though?
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-13 5
I love Airbnb! This app just makes it so much easier!!!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-12 4
The AirBnB app is easy to use and has just the features you need when you're on the road: specifically, it's very easy to use the app to track your reservations, get directions, contact your host, and leave feedback when your stay is done. For actual research / booking I'd stick with the website, unless you're in a last-minute pinch.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-12 5
Love it
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-11 4
I am a very seasoned air bnb user and this app needs a lot of work. There is a lot going on but since you are an internet company your apps should rock. And rock bigtime. Come on, no dedicated iPad app? Clumsy interface? Passbook is a good addition but i would love to see you raise the bar.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-11 5
Great help
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-11 2
This app was great when not so many people knew about it. Now there's more available, more and more realtors and hotels have flooded this market. Most likely get more congested. Wish Airbnb monitored it more.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-11 5
Filters are great, love the photo - centric layout. Very visually stimulating.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-11 5
I appreciate how accessible the world becomes with air bnb and how immersive and creative travel becomes...leaving the power to tailor your experience in your hands. The app only enhances that accessibility and promotes community even further...all the while at your fingertips. Thanks air bnb for the care evident in the execution of the idea to transform and invigorate the travel industry!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-10 4
Needs an upgrade though, calendar maybe?
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-10 5
Great app, fantastic idea. I'm at an AirBNB place now and it's so pretty & clean & the hosts are warm & inviting.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-09 5
So easy to use and make air bnb life easy.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-09 5
Everything about this service is top notch!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-08 5
Easy to use, it's a great app
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-08 5
AirBNB is the way to stay when traveling. The app is clean, appealing, and easy to use. I love using AirBNB to find amazing places to stay when I travel!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-08 5
Awesome!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-08 5
Makes booking easy!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-08 5
Hoo!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-08 4
Really like this app. Please, please, please make an iPad version with a little more functionality. Would defn give five stars then.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-07 5
If you are traveling this app is a must to locate homes to stay at wether its one night or a month! Highly recommend
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-07 5
Used airbnb a few times now and this companion app is designed and developed well. Able to respond to hosts and browse apartments easily.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-07 5
'Nuff said
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-07 4
I absolutely love this app, it's an identical replica of their site and business. The instant notifications are super useful, and it's so easy to communicate and book/host any stay! A full mobile Calendar and Guidebook feature would put it at 5 stars for me :)
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-06 4
Easy to use, love all futures. Only one recommendation: when someone is requesting to stay at our place, the app does not display the total amount. Also, once reservation is done, there is no way to look up how much are we to receive.
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-06 4
You need to be able to price out an itinerary right in the moment, and as hosts, the calendar should be front and center. And also, signing in every single time is an incredible headache. I realize this is likely for security, but maybe you should leave it up to the user.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-06 4
Absolutely love this app. Completely planned out trip around Europe with it!
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-06 5
I love looking at all the different places to stay! Definitely affordable too!
Version 2.5.0 2013-03-06 5
Best apps design. Period.
Version 2.5.2 2013-03-06 3
Needs to tell you how much an itinerary is worth at a glance. Otherwise it is a great app for managing your airbnb listing.
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-06 4
If you had the option of filtering by dog friendly joints you'd be getting five stars, my airbnb friends.  Other than that great app.
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-05 1
This app is nearly useless as a host. It does not provide the dashboard to control your properties and does not show prices for inquiries. It allows nowhere near as many options as the normal website and is incredibly frustrating. The actual website is wonderful so I do not know how this app falls so short.
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-05 5
Airbnb is awesome to work with and do a great job of connecting travelers with people who have interesting homes to share
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-04 5
We had an amazing experience and look forward to many more!
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-03 5
Airbnb is an incredible site. It's brilliant. I have met some of the most incredible people ever, & have been 100% satisfied with every place I've stayed at. I've yet to have a bad experience yet. I highly recommend.
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-03 5
Awesome app
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-03 5
Love the AIRBNB app.  Easy to use while on the go, great response time, and great layout.  Makes traveling a breeze !
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-03 5
A must have to travel and host. I've tried other sites and other apps but airbnb is by far the best!!
Version 2.5.0 2013-03-02 5
I love AirBnB. I don't book hotels or stay in places any other way anymore. The app has a clean design and intuitive navigation style making it easy to search for places or communicate back and fourth with hosts.
Version 2.5.1 2013-03-01 5
Great app
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-27 5
I LOVE the Airbnb ap when I'm traveling!!
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-27 5
Love it
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-27 3
This last update introduced a lot of bugs for me. The app crashes when I access host features like adding pictures or leaving a guest review.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-27 4
I do a lot of traveling and this app always helps me find places
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-26 4
The app isn't as versatile as the website on a desktop, but whose is? It's still easy to work with. I use the desktop to do my searching, and the app to manage once I've booked. Very nice.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-26 5
Immediately after listing my guest room I booked a reservation for a lovely couple that were unable to secure a hotel room last minute due to everything being sold out. The inquires and reservations have been on a daily basis and I LOVE the app and website for all the obvious reasons. Thank you AirBnb,
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-26 5
This is one of the most amazing ideas! Makes me want to travel even more!
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-26 5
The benefits of Airbnb are amazing!... Think about what happens when you know you are going to host some guests: You clean up your home, put out your most inspiring stuff to share, courageously anticipate letting new people into your world, discover assets and income you didn't know was there, all with full coverage insurance and partners that provide world class, quality service etc. etc. - Airbnb is a humanitarian cornerstone in a new sharing economy that puts hope  and prosperity back into people's hearts.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-26 5
I used AIR BNB to book an apartment in Rio De Janeiro, the apartment was phenomenal and the experience using the service was flawless. I will never use a hotel again!
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-25 5
I love the concept of this website and app! I look forward to using this app in the future when I'm traveling or need to get away. Simple and easy to use, and I love being able to see each room with reviews and amazing photos.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-24 5
I haven't used any of the services yet but I love the look and feel and the concept of this app! I can't wait to actually book something!
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-14 5
this app is so easy I would laugh at anyone who wastes money on a hotel again. just dl the airbnb app and your life will become so much simpler when traveling. better locations and cool people await around every turn.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-14 5
We only used AirBnB on our 3 month South America trip and it was fantastic. Everywhere we went people were saying how much they paid for hostels/hotels/etc and then they would hear how much we paid. I think I convinced about ten people to use the app while traveling.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-13 5
Used this app extensively during my medical residency interview season. I saved huge amounts of money, met cool people, and had way more fun than if I had stayed alone in a hotel. I heart AirBnB!
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-13 2
It's just not functioning on the iPad
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-12 4
Wished they had an iPad version, annoying having to use this app and not have full potential of entire screen even with 2x
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-12 5
very easy to use. very intuitive. airbnb beats using a hotel so this app is great to find a place while on the go.
Version 2.5.0 2013-02-12 4
Wonderful location with host Myron there to great me.  The condo was delivered as expected,  clean and in good repair. I would surely stay there again.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-11 4
Great app! But users should be able to add existing photos from iPhone.
Version 2.5.0 2013-02-11 5
Fantastic app and service.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-11 5
As a current user i can say that Airbnb gives you a chance to really design your own vacation while working harmoniously with your budget. Explore luxury like 5 star options or seclude yourself from the world in a modern mountainous hideaway. There's no marketplace like Airbnb, so do yourself a favor and stop being a tourist and start being a traveler!!
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-10 5
This app has become an addiction! I love to look for new listings and it works very smoothly!
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-09 5
This app has opened up a whole new world of travel and fun. It's a very thrifty way to travel and enjoy places you would not usually be able to afford.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-09 4
I listed my listing House of the Doggz surf vacation house and it was easy to set up, easy to upload pictures and overall a good way to get my house outt here. Check it out
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-08 4
This place is awesome. I just started prepping my place so that I can host. Would be able to update and edit postings and profile from app.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-08 4
It's true - I'm a big fan. I've only hosted thus far, but will be using the service as a guest in November. 

One thing: the website and app are buggy. The app crashes, and the website did strange things to the ad for my apartment. 

Other than that, excellent service!
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-08 3
Needs links and more directives to add more photos and edit profile text
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-07 3
Love love it 1000x
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-05 4
It works fine, but could be better if we could upload photos from iPhone's camera roll.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-04 5
Great app, faster and easier than using the actual website.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-04 5
Great idea. It's all over the world.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-03 1
Crashed after I left a review, and left me with no way of knowing if the review was accepted.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-03 5
All you need
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-03 5
Well done.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-02 4
Love AirBNB and the app is near perfect. Highly recommend.
Version 2.5.1 2013-02-02 5
This app and product will blow your mind. You will find awesome places at great rates in every place you can imagine. Also, this app is very intuitive and extremely user friendly, highly recommended!

This worked great on my phone until the latest update. Now I can't login without it crashing. Please fix Airbnb.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-24 5
I love it!!!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-24 5
This is such a well made app and a great service.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-24 5
The app is very user friendly and very reliable. Reservations are easily made and works just like the full website.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-23 4
Great App! I am a Host and so far I cannot figure out how to update my listing. That is the only issue I can see....and it may be capable of doing that - I just do not see how, YET ;) if nothing else,  I would think it needs to be more clearly defined how hosts can update the property description. THANKS AIRBNB! Swan Hill B&B and Lake Cabin love you!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-22 4
To put it simply, Adam and Sophie we're a fun loving couple with a wonderful atmosphere. The room cozy with a plush bathroom.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-22 5
I love airbnb. It's the only way we will travel from now on. The app is so convenient too!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-22 5
I have been using airbnb for a few months as a host and soon to be guest. This app is fantastic. I am often not at a computer so this is crucial to me so that I can respond in a timely manner to inquires. 

Thanks!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-22 5
Parfait
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-22 5
Great places to find in expensive stays , especially now on budgets.

Version 2.5.0 2013-01-21 5
Love it!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-21 5
This is a great app that is easy to use and functional. We loved air b&b as guest and now we are host. I use the app all the time and almost never use the full site now. Couldn't be happier with this awesome service.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-20 5
Fantastic app for a fantastic service. Thank you!
Version 2.2.0 2013-01-20 5
I'm both an Airbnb host and guest, and this app is super helpful.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-20 5
The map feature is great for finding a spot when on the move- logging in from a non mobile device gives you more in depth options like reviews and references but the app works great.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-18 4
I love everything about the airbnb concept. 
With regards to the app and some of the recent updates, I find that the interface went from being clean and straightforward to a little murky and unnecessary. 
My main gripe is the favourites/wishlists. For any perso. Browsing or planning, it is obviously one of the most important features, I like that you have added the ability to create specific lists but it is annoying and initially it was kind of confusing because you add something to a list and the drop down stays on the screen waiting for you to do something... Too many taps and untapping things by accident. 

The wishlist is also nowhere to be seen when you open the app and surprisingly it isn't even in the sidebar, you have to go into your profile to find your wishlists and it seems very deprioritised In terms of the UI menu hierarchy. I find myself always wanting much more Immediate access to it.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-17 5
Easy to use
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-15 5
My first time booking with airbnb... Love the place I stayed in Paris, it was perfect better then hotel. Privacy and able to be part of the city and the surrounding. I will use airbnb for all my travel. It gave the city of Love Paris more Love then I could ask for it was perfect.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-15 5
I've used airbnb three times for European travel. On 2 trips, I stayed with hosts & on my upcoming trip, I've reserved a private flat. The hosts I stayed with were absolutely wonderful people & I would recommend them to anyone. It saved me a fortune & I learned things about the cities I would have never known had I not stayed with a local.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-15 3
The app is fine, airbnb is a great concept that often works well. The problem is people who list places that are not really available, it is very time consuming and difficult to plan a trip with this problem. Airbnb needs to deal with listers who can not manage their listing and waste everyone's time. For my recent booking to San Francisco I finally got a hotel after many listers either did not respond or said it was unavailable though listed as available.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-15 5
I just got the new upgrade and I love the way I can view my upcoming guests. I think I'll rely on the iPad more now. Thanks!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-14 5
A great app and even better customer service. We booked and had a bad experience only to have all our problems solved
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-14 3
I love this ap, but recently, I've been having issues when trying to respond to inquiries from customers trying to make a booking with me. It will ONLY allow me to send a special offer, but not leave or attach a message in any way that I can see. I'm using the site on my browser instead until this gets fixed.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-14 5
It's nice
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-13 5
I live this concept and it brings you much more in touch with the authenticity of a location. You can live like a local and cut down on restaurant eating and meet fantastic people! As both parties are reviewed it makes it more save to meet since no one wants to ruin their reputation ...
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-13 5
As a guest or a host, it's efficient and you meet cool people wherever you go. Hotels are so 2.0.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-12 5
The best traveling app in the world.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-11 5

With AirBnB I can travel and stay nicely.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-11 5
Easy to use. I just booked a room in minutes. All my info is stored.  I love the air bnb picks and neighborhoods!  I have discovered so many places to consider in my travels.  Have had great luck with places we've stayed.  No complaints here.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-09 4
I love the app. My one complaint is that every time I try to login, the app kicks me out. Any suggestions or solutions? 
Thanks
Van
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-09 5
Love the easy user interface! Very clean and simple design. Love the way I am able to view my wish lists.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-09 2
Good but regrettable that is not available high definition in full screen for iPad.
No sort from low to high
No sort "available from..."
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-08 3
Works fine, but would this app would be great if they developed more filtered features like if a place has a security deposit or not.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-08 5
Would be nice if app had a dashboard like it does on the website for ppl who host to check metrics. Overall very user friendly app.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-07 5
Helps me do everything I need to manage my account.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-07 4
Love AirBnB as it alerts me to potential bookings on all my mobile devices and then allows me to respond or update my listings remotely! Enables me to easily maintain a 100% response rate!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-07 5
This app is truly incredible. Very user friendly, beautiful images of hosts locations, very simple to navigate. Great job Airbnb.!!!!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-07 1
Beware, after using this app several times I booked a place with a bad host. After discussion with the host he agreed to cancel the reservation, but airbnb still is trying to charge me $165. They will not allow customers to speak to the airbnb employee who makes the decision. I would strongly recommend using a different company like VRBO.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-07 5

Version 2.5.0 2013-01-06 2
That's pretty much it--it's a wonderful app when I can actually log into it. I've gotten an error every time I've attempted to log in since the latest update, and all my other apps/software are up to date, so wondering when this will be fixed. Does not appear that everyone is having the same trouble though...hm...anyone find a fix?
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-06 5

I constantly use apps for business, house hunting, everything really. We came to LA with very little money and high hopes. (The usual moving to Hollywood story) it took maybe 10 minutes to find the perfect place in the perfect location and 7 of those minutes were just figuring out how much the app has to offer! It really tells you everything you need to know. Searching by location was easiest. Each listing has photos, house rules, amenities, parking info, everything you need to know right there. No fees, no bs, just a credit card to book the room (which we didn't have and they let us pay cash when we got there). Everyone on this site is very different and the properties and locations are endless. I just talked to a couple of girls who used the same app all over the country. If we did not find this app we would have been lost to say the least! Thank you for this app!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-04 5
Absolutely fantastic and super easy to use!
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-04 1
App is fine but no customer service to back it up. You will open your home to strangers but you will not get a straight answer from airbnb if you contact them with a problem. You will not receive a return phone call. You will be told to take care of your problem yourself with your problem tenant - assuming they even show up. I'm not happy with the service. Shiny website and app backed up by 3rd world service.
Version 2.2.3 2013-01-04 5
Airbnb is the absolute best for helping me book affordable spots all over and meeting amazing folks along the way. The app is a great way to stay in contact with property owners on the go.
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-02 5
It's easy to use and contact host !
Version 2.5.0 2013-01-02 5
Wonderful app that gives you the lower of the website in an easy to use format. I use it mainly for communicating with guests, and it is indispensable.  Being able to respond to questions within minutes is extremely helpful when trying to book reservations.  A must have!

We've stayed in the most unique places and met the best people because of Airbnb. It also saves us money during our extensive travels. It's so much more comfortable to stay in apartments and houses than sterile hotels. Plus we can cook our own food when we get tired of restaurant fare. Win, win, win!
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-31 5
Great way to travel and always act like a local
Version 2.2.3 2012-12-30 5
We have stayed in many areas with hosts worldwide. Never any other way to travel and live it up local style, with local hospitality!!!!

Airbnb is my only option when I travel they are the best option for any type of accommodations all over the world..

Airbnb saved my life. I needed a last minute 5 month rental in Austin, TX. I found the most wonderful hostess. Also, the customer service is second to none! I will no longer book a regular hotel.
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-28 5
This is the best app. I find places last minute all the time(best to look in advance). I've had such a positive experience and feel it is much more worth it than paying an over priced hotel. All the hosts I have felt with have been super accommodating and friendly. I feel much more comfortable knowing that my hard earned cash is going to good people rather than a hotel who doesn't care for your concerns. I recommend this to anyone who travels often or just for a quick getaway. You will always find what u are looking for and more. I can't rave enough! Thank you!
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-27 2
Every time I try to log into the app the app crashes. It does not work for a host who is trying to access the functionality, needs to be improved. The web site works great and the concept is terrific but the user login is not working.
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-27 3
As a huge supporter of Airbnb, I enjoy using the simple interface of their app. I would like to see the following improvements, however:
- refined search capabilities ie. ability to click on a map, choose state, borough, or area. 
- more detailed filters ie. search box that allows me to enter exactly what it is I'm looking for.
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-27 5
I never knew this existed and now that I do I feel cheated for wasting thousands upon thousands of dollars at hotels. This app is the epitome of social media greatness.
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-27 5
AirBnB allowed us to find 2 great apartments for our family if 5 in the nicest part of Istanbul. It worked flawlessly.
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-26 5
Use it to meet new people, travel nice and affordable or make some money! Great service and app!
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-26 4
Some owners are not quick responders others are. fees such as $18 cleaning fee and $8 booking fee are added on. over all great app! found last min deals had wonderful experience. This is the way to travel for the future for sure!
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-26 5
We love Airbnb
Version 2.2.0 2012-12-26 5
I LOVE the originality there. Just like the  site airbnb. Great app never fails
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-25 5
Guys who make this service,thank you.It is realy cool and best for trip.
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-25 4
This is a great app and allows you to do searches and reservations equally or better than using a computer. I love the way the pictures are displayed.
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-25 5
Planning so many affordable vacations. Determined to see all 50 states.
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-25 5
Love the app!
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-25 5
Love love love air bnb. The app needs to allow you to review your guest! It would be so helpful to not have to wait until you get to a laptop to do so...
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-23 4
My one complaint with the app is when someone new makes a booking request, it is unclear how much it is for. This particularly poses problems when I have special prices set for certain days.
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-22 3
This app is helpful as a host but its really geared towards guest. All the updates must be for the iPhone 5. I have a iPhone 4 and am very limited what I can do with the app. 

I can't view my calendar, update properties, write reviews nor can I message potential guest from my inbox and see what I'm typing in the message field once it reaches a certain area.

The newest updated didn't do anything that could be helpful for me. 

Other than that Airbnb is a great site and a great way to host trusted 
people from all over the world.
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-22 5
Great app
Version 2.5.0 2012-12-22 5
This is the Best Website Ever!!!!!
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-22 4
I researched a number of websites before deciding to list our guest cabin on Airbnb. I give Airbnb 5 stars for their model to connect individuals with one another. The app works flawlessly but  is still missing a key feature for hosts: it lacks access to view and edit the calendar.

Other than that issue, the Airbnb app is ABSOLUTELY essential to be successful as a host. Instant notification of requests for info and requests to make a reservation are so, so, so essential to be able to know immediately what the guest wants (reservation, question, info). With the amazing instant notification feature, I'm able to respond to the prospective guest within a few minutes or less.

In overnight rentals, it he first bird gets the booking.  If you're a host, you can't afford not to eek out a little space on your iPhone, install this app
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-22 5
best biz model & best mobile app
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-20 5
Incredible site, great app
Version 2.2.3 2012-12-20 5
I am in love with airbnb, I love travelling and this is the answer for my craziness for traveling the world. Amazing!
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-18 3
Please update this app. Apparently, the currency settings are not being honored in the features section of the app. The price fluctuates with different currencies every time I open the app. It is not very helpful to glance at locals to see prices in Thai Baht or in English Pounds when what I want to see are prices in dollars. Thanks!
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-18 5
Vrrryy kewl
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-17 5
There should be more companies out there like AirBnB.
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-17 5
A great design that is clean and easy to navigate. I think the app might be better than the full website!
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-17 5
I'm so glad I found this app. I've been a fan of Airbnb for a while now, it's great to now have it everywhere I go!
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-17 5
Nicely done
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-16 5
and their app is great for when your on the road or away on your trip. easy to use.
Version 2.3.0 2012-12-16 4
Fast and convenient. Would be nice to be able to access calendar and be able to view message thread when replying. But solid and intuitive.
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-15 5
This app does everything you need to access airbnb's awesome service. Love this app and this company.  Bravo to a fantastic idea!!!
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-14 5
It was super easy to book and really allows you to get acquainted with the area you're travelling to.
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-13 5
Works as it should and it's easy
Version 2.2.3 2012-12-13 5
I was a bit intimidated by airbnb'ng at first as I had never traveled that way but had hosted people before through similar websites. However I love airbnb and their app. They are always quick to respond with help or questions you might have, the app is like a mini notebook with all of your notes for your trip. Very useful, very organized.
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-13 5
Useful, for real.
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-12 3
I love AirBnb, its service, and its design, but the new app isn't great for hosts. There's no ability to edit or update your calendar. That's nuts. Fix that and it'll be a great app.
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-11 5
It's truly amazing when an app can literally open a whole new world to you. I had no idea places like these were available to rent. This app will now be my companion for every future trip!
Version 2.4.0 2012-12-11 5
I don't write reviews. However, this app and AirBnB have helped me raise $3,000 in 2 months for a 9' x 5' room and provided me more options that I didn't know existed.
Version 2.3.0 2012-12-11 4
Great app!! A simple alternative to hotels- fun way to check listings . 

 2 details prevent this app from getting perfect 5 stars score: 1st there is no "sort". No option to organize results based on price or amount of reviews. 

2nd it's a bit difficult to define geographical parameters, for instance, looking for places in manhattan will also show places in Brooklyn. 

Small details easy to resolve by developers.
Version 2.3.0 2012-12-11 4
The app makes pulling up info on the go really easy!
Version 2.2.0 2012-12-09 5
The only complaint is I've had problems searching by a certain price
Version 2.3.0 2012-12-09 4
Recently the application switched from bottom navigation buttons to the current version. I found the older version better easier to use. No iPad support yet.

When traveling, the application is increasingly useful though. The one time I used AirBnb when traveling, I didn't feel the need to bring a computer at all.
Version 2.3.0 2012-12-07 3
This is a good app that is frequently upgraded. I would like to bring to the attention of developers that enabling the location bases services drains the battery. Even when the app isn't opened, location is used and uses way too much of the battery. It would be great to have a fix in the future.
Version 2.3.0 2012-12-07 5
I love Airbnb it's been helping me rent my apartments for almost a year now and this app helps a lot. I just wish there was a way to sync my Airbnb calendar to my phone's.  I recommend this for hosts and future travelers.
Version 2.2.1 2012-12-05 5
I love Air BnB!! As a performer I am constantly using this service to find rooms for cheap cheap cheap! They are always as nice or nicer than hotels. The descriptions of the rooms are always very accurate. Air BnB saves me from having to impose on my friends every time I come in town for an audition. I've never had an unpleasant experience. I will continue to use this service as long as it is available :-)
Version 2.3.0 2012-12-04 1
OMG ! In your latest update you misspelled the word 'Norwegian' ! That is a shame !
Version 2.2.3 2012-12-04 4
Makes finding a place to stay and adventure. Wish it could sort by price and features like parking. Otherwise of give it a 5 star
Version 2.2.3 2012-12-02 2
So far I've had to call the site and have them verify simple things like my phone number. It's confusing, but I'm sure after everything is set up it will be useful. I just have to use a desktop version not my iPhone.
Version 2.2.3 2012-12-02 5
This app should be number one the appstore cuz it is first in economy first in enthusiasm in traveling and also in social networking greatttttttttttttttt from now i won't saty in any hotel cuz i have the airbnb app
Version 2.2.3 2012-12-02 1
Here are the experiences I've had with Airbnb so far:

1. I booked a place in Santa Barbara. Unfortunately we had a tragedy the day before the trip so needed to cancel the reservation. The cancellation cost me 50% of the booking, around $500. The owner offered me to use the place another time but I can't find another time to visit Santa Barbara, and can't recover the $500 cancellation fee. 
2. I reserved a place in ShenZhen, China, but then discovered the address of the apartment was no where near the location on the map shown on Airbnb, i.e. the location I wanted to be in. Other apartments also had this map placement problem. Apparently Google maps also has issues displaying the correct locations in China, which may be related to this problem. I ended up having to sleep on a couch instead. 

So while I love the concept of AirBnB, it hasn't worked out for me in the first 2 cases I've made a booking :(
Version 2.2.3 2012-12-01 1
I go to contact host and the app brings me to the select calendar page. Then the unit says 99 for one night so I put that in and it says total 200$. 

Not cool!
Version 2.2.3 2012-12-01 4
Never travel any other way when you're young and low on cash - you still get to see the world on a budget!
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-30 5
Very impressed with the UI and functionality of the App. I wish some of the functionality from the site were available but I'm sure that will come.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-29 5
Great app for anyone that likes to travel!
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-28 5
Why is it so hard to make an iPad version and make this perfect?
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-28 5
Great for booking a room at the last minute. I only wish they could get rid of the delay between when messages arrive in the app and when they arrive in your email inbox...
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-28 5
Great app. Love it.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-28 5
Thanks for the wonderful app. Love the concept and implementation.

AirBnB is a solid renting service that offers a very different take on vacations than a hotel room.

The service itself is great and transactions feel safe.  As for the app, very convenient and easy to use.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-25 5
I use Air BnB and its great! I rely on it as much as I rely on my GPS. I use it to book a place and communicate with my  hosts. My stays, because of this app, have been fantastic!
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-24 5
I was a guest in 3 ABnB listings while traveling in Israel October. I was a first time user and certainly will consider the site as my #1 source for foreign and domestic travel in the future
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-24 4
Needs more features for hosts!  Calendar and pricing most important!
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-23 5
If you use Airbnb, this app won't disappoint!
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-22 5
This app helps dreaming girls like me makes those dreams a reality!!! Thank you for making air BNB an app.  

Dreams really do come true!!!
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-21 5
Pretty cool idea!  No more over priced hotels!

Great website, great App. Extremely happy!
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-20 3
Being almost 100% mobile, I need to manage my property with an intuitive app, but it falls short of being able to effectively do so. From errors during login to limited functionality, you are better off using their website. I LOVE airbnb, but they need schooled in mobile needs and UI design.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-20 4
This app is great and extremely easy to navigate. I was able to make vacation plans without using my laptop once. But I give it 4 stars because some financial aspects are not viewable until checkout (such as the deposit, in some case). However, everything else is great including the messaging system and the push notifications.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-20 4
Where are messages sent? Not sure if messages went out? Overall great concept.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-19 4
Everything just works well. I just hope they have all the features of the site in the app too. Nonetheless its user friendly and well thought app.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-05 4
Thanks to airbnb I've been able to make additional $$$ while sharing my large house and spare room(s), and meet nice worldly travelers. Looking forward to being a host, again and again.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-05 5
It is a great app for booking homes
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-05 2
I downloaded the app on the go and decided to make a last minute reservation. The listing stated that dog(s) were allowed under amenities. I went ahead with the reservation because it was a great location and I could bring my pets. The home owner accepted and I contacted the seller just to confirm the dogs section and they stated that it is listed as pets not accepted in their listing. I contacted airbnb customer service and they were very helpful in assisting. I went ahead and sent a screen shot of my phone for proof to both the home owner and the customer service representative to prove that this app info is incorrect. 

Great concept though.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-04 5
I am a host and just want to say " thanks"
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-04 4
This app is great but you should e able to see payout history in the app and you should be able to write guest reviews in the app. You have to log into the website to do both but it would be nice if you could do these task within the app. Also, you can add pictures, however, you cannot add or edit a description for the pictures or for the property in the app. Would be a nice addition as well. Also, would be nice for check-in reminders. Otherwise, it's a great app.
Version 2.2.3 2012-11-04 4
Planning my drive across country with airbnb. Love the amount of pet friendly places we are finding and the prices! What a great idea! App has made the bookings hassle free. Was able to change reservation dates so easy.  Love the ability to find thenplaces and message them right in the app.

Very good app. To find the perfect vacation rentals almost anywhere!!!!
Version 2.2.3 2012-10-31 5
Great app and great idea for a service. The app makes your life easier because you can see your upcoming reservations without having to log on to the full site. If you're a host you should definitely have the app.
Version 2.2.3 2012-10-30 5
Airbnb and the app are both awesome, period. But what's up with the new icon that neither reflects the uniqueness of the brand nor the fun of the spaces available inside? Please change it back!
Version 2.2.3 2012-10-30 5
Loving this app...great graphics,easy to use,very informative and fun...

Will return for update after first booking...

Well designed app. Very handy with instant notifications. Booked a room last minute on the go with it. Love airbnb.
Version 2.2.3 2012-10-25 5
Superbly well put together app, coolest concept, reasonably good worrying about security and great appeal for the legitimate and coherent. 

AirBnB works well in virtually every way possible, beyond having a website that could alone smash its every competitor. 

I've been using it and cannot honestly utter any negatives, except perhaps that a few notifications failed on me; which is totally overlook-able. 

Good job lads.
Version 2.2.3 2012-10-25 1
I set Facebook timeline posting to "off" but it still posts. You cannot stop it. 

Also doesn't synch with web site activity, wish lists don't match up and often saved properties aren't actually saved.

Version 2.2.2 2012-10-22 5
Superb application..has almost every feature from the website. The search engine is good. The best feature is the direct communication with owner.

An annoying bug: pricing doesn't always populate correctly when toggling. A feature I'd like to see: eliminating search results after I've ruled them out. Overall, well done UI & great service.

I think this site was absolutely perfect for me! My stay at Juan's place in Philadelphia was a perfect location and was a great price for the time I stayed. It saved me $1000! The app works fine also!
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-18 2
All of it needs to be entered every time for every reservation, which is a fairly big pain. Contacted customer support and was told there was no timetable to fix this problem.

So stoked about this site!!!

Version 2.2.2 2012-10-12 5
1-stop shopping for all my travel destination needs.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-11 4
Does what it needs to do and provides some great information. Love the integration with passbook!
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-11 1
I wish there a feature where you could stay long term instead of by each night!!!
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-10 2
This is okay.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-10 5
Love the service. Love the app. Love the experience. In.sane. :D
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-10 5
Love the flexibility and accessibility. Thinking of listing my own property too!!
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-10 3
I find this app to have decent functionality, but I'm typically going to the site to do more involved tasks beyond checking in.  Also, would be nice if this actually fit a full iPad screen.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-09 4
Well designed mobile app that definitely features photos very well. I wish All the features for Hosts were also available inside the mobile app. Overall it's an excellent tool to help me manage my awesomesauce Airbnb lifestyle. w00t! ;)
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-09 4
So far so good, it made booking a place easier.  Nice to know where and the looks of a place before you get surprised.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-09 5
I am never staying at a hotel ever again
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-09 5
This is a super way to get away from boring hotels and a great way to meet new people! 
As a host this is great for extra income and to meet fellow adventure lovers :)
Version 2.2.1 2012-10-09 5
Visually and user friendly. Even helped us make reservations while abroad in France.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-09 5
Love this app!! It allows me to stay in neighborhoods in NYC that are walking distance to friends and family. !!!  Thanks Airbnb!!
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-09 5
I love this app
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-08 5
Simple and beautiful.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-08 5
This app allows me to respond quickly to clients and keep up with upcoming rentals!  Love it!
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-08 2
It's fun to see what's available, but the app would freeze, then crash way too often.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-08 5
i love this one .. wow cant believe it how cheap the hotels,
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-07 5
Airbnb is a great idea, and the only thing holding it back is trust. If people had a little more trust it would be the most used app ever. I can't wait to get my extra room listed.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-07 4
Nicely done
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-07 4
Still you need to fix some bugs at times it crashes and I have to go to the laptop to interact with the host. Otherwise I like it
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-07 5
Serious, why stay at hotels, if you can now find awesome places around the world.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-07 4
Solid
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-07 4
Wonderful job!!
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-07 2
App worked first day.  I'll say navigation and layout are pretty good.  Second day though, can't create a user, can't login, can't research "current location". Every option gives an error message.  Big let down.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-07 1
I just got the app and am trying to use it and I've found that no matter how many times I force quit the app and or restart my phone, it continues to error out. Good thing it's free. It's worth every penny.
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-07 5
It's so refreshing to have a different type of travel app out there!
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-06 5
So easy to use. Thanks for this guys!
Version 2.2.2 2012-10-06 5
I like this app but how do I verify whether it can be trusted or not?
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-29 5
What you'd hope for, what you'd expect
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-29 5
Works good and the ease of use is prima!
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-27 5
Amazing app. Very well done.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-27 5
Airbnb is great app ;)
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-26 5
Paired with the zipcar app, it turns the iPhone into an agent of freedom. Car and apt. in any city, at any time, on the spot. Technology, man.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-24 3
The message center (which is the only way to contact people) fails constantly. I either get error messages or the message appears to be sent, but then doesn't post to the conversation text board. 

When can we expect an iPad version? Love the iPhone app, would be thrilled to also have a version formatted for iPad.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-24 5
Love this app! Haven't figured out how to leave a review from it yet, but I'm sure it's there. The call center for airbnb was very helpful and my rep worked with me to answer my questions. Love it!
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-24 5
My wife and I download airbnb just a few days before leaving on our trip. We booked an accommodation right away! The registration was simple. The searching for and the booking of rooms is user friendly and intuitive.  We can't recommend airbnb highly enough!
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-23 5
Highly recommend this app for anyone whom likes to travel and explore!
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-23 5
This little app lets you see even more than the airbnb site...so far, I've noticed additional location details and additional offer from a host that did not appear on the website.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-23 5
All the features of the website conveniently in app form.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-23 5
AirBnb is all about awesomeness! Awesome idea into an awesome app. So easy to find the perfect place to stay, ranging from cheap to expensive, you'll find exactly what you want.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-22 5
This app continues to improve and it is starting to show real refinement
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-20 5
Great site for the budget traveller although there are listings for those that prefer fancier digs too. Check them out!
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-20 5
It is a new way of traveling and not spending a lot of money on hotels and if you have a place to rent it is a great oportunity to do it.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-20 5
Love the service.  New to the app buy so far so good!!
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-20 5
From your iPhone or iPad you can select your lodging for the next day! And pre-pay! You could get a luxurious B&B or a simple room in someone's condo in the middle of Montreal for cheap! Can't say too much about this.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-19 5
Easy to use
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-19 1
You cannot translate conversations on the app. It was very difficult to communicate with someone who spoke a different language. I had to keep going back to my computer.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-19 5
.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-19 5
I will be using this for my trip to Vegas for my bday in April! This app is so amazing and I have had it almost a year and is so accurate and such a great way to save money and experience travel the way it was meant to be experienced!!!
--G
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-19 5
I've been using airbnb for a year and everything was perfect, price, house and people. I highly recommend this app!!!
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-16 5
Ottima app anche per airbnb Italia
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-15 3
I think that this is a good app and gets the job done. When you're not home you can still complete a reservation both as owner and guest.
However a big issue is for me (I'm a host) the fact that I cannot see my CALENDAR . 
It's very hard to accept or deny a reservation without the calendar in front of me. Please fix that!
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-15 4
Love the app for iPhone but where's the iPad version?
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-15 5
PLEASE IPAD WITH RETINA UPDATE!!!!!!

iPad this Shiz ASAP!

This would be perfect on the new iPad.  Please hurry and develop.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-15 5
I love the AirBnB iPhone app! It helped me book rooms while I traveled Europe in 2010, and now that I'm settled back in the States it helps me manage my apartment booking requests on the go and keep my listing current! It's easy to use and very intuitive! Love it!
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-14 5
I was able to book a place to stay with this app while traveling.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-14 4
I love airBnB!  As a host, this app is indispensable!!!  It makes answering emails and reservation requests SUPER easy.

My only complaint is, I cannot view a calendar with all my upcoming reservations for both my rentals on one page like is possible on the website.

Also, I can't figure out how to leave a review of someone from the app.

Overall, though, it has a beautiful interface and is a really important tool for a busy host like me!
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-13 4
Great concept. App is easy to understand and use.  My only complaint is that the bnb price advertisements inaccurately display the lowest price and do not reflect total fees until check out.
Version 2.2.1 2012-09-13 4
I love this service. But the photos take forever render when not connected to wifi.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-13 5
Best travel app ever!
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-12 4
Great app for the wonderful website! The wish list causes the app to close which is a bummer but everything else runs smoothly. Fix that glitch and it's definitely 5 star worthy. Will be using this on any trip that I take.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-11 5
Best service  and app will be using it for all my travel accommodation requirements
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-11 5
Wish I could ate my wish list, but otherwise awesome!
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-10 4
Love the app and concept... But wish lists crash the app
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-08 4
Makes it easy to do nearly everything from your phone.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-08 4
Well organized and fast, but the app crashes every time you try to access or save to your wish lists
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-08 5
So after a few months of worry about how my trips would play out using this service I am happy to report that I am more than pleased.  My first stop was to Susana's in Alfama Portugal. It was exactly as described and she was very kind and generous to us. Two bottles of  wine ( table and Port) that were wonderful iced tea and water. Oh yes and half a dozen fresh peaches! What a love. Next Barcelona with Tere. First of all she picked us up at the airport and her rental was perfect clean and very well decorated. Full of amenities and Wifi! I'm super happy that we used this valuable service!
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-08 5
One of the best app.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-08 2
As said, this version keeps crashing on wishlist.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-07 2
It was great until recently. Not sure what's happening but it crashes everytime I click on my wish list. Also I got a message yesterday about some quota and I couldn't log in. Pls fix!
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-07 5
I know I'm supposed to review the app which I think is wonderful but the whole idea of Air BnB is brilliant! I love it, it is the best thing for good people who love to travel. So much better than paying for a hotel. And you end up meeting interesting and kind people along the way. Worth the risk for a fantastic experience.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-06 4
From both a host and guest perspective......nearly flawless. But how about a landscape keyboard please..... Then it's a 5 star app.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-06 5
This app is such a handy little tool for keeping track on my reservations and searches. I especially like that I can chat and call my prospective host directly from the app. The fact that it's integrated with Google Maps also makes it a wonderful travel tool.  I highly recommend it!
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-06 5
Does everything it needs to and works great.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-06 5
Thanks for making an efficient, user-friendly, easy-to-use app! I've found great and unique lodging. Although I do love the app, it's not as detailed as the website. A couple of suggestions for the mobile app:

- Ability to edit profile (besides just adding photos).

- A way to let customers see the total fees (the fee might increase depending how many people are staying) prior to pushing "Book it!" button.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-06 5
Best app ever!!!!p
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-05 4
Great inventory and amazing marketplace for the traveler, jet setter or otherwise. 

I'd add some features though:

1. Permanent filters so I don't have to set it after every search in a new location. 

2. CC profile for faster transactions (I haven't made a booking yet so I'm not 100% sure of the process, but the app GUI doesn't have a "wallet" feature for me to add a CC. 

3. Filter by needs to be sticky. Sometimes i want to search different areas in the same city. Or willing to stay in the town over (Brooklyn instead of NY,NY) the filters should memorize last previous filter by state.
Version 2.2.0 2012-09-05 5
Sooo happy to have found this app. Works well to communicate with the host. Happy traveling!
Version 2.2.0 2012-08-06 5
This app is very easy to use.
Version 2.2.0 2012-08-06 5
This app has so many useful features, I'm a avid homeaway and vrbo renter (haven't stayed in a hotel in years) but their app is a disgrace! I am always on the go and with communication with the owners via airbnb app (which also sends me a text to let me know I received a response to an inquiry or reservation) it's by far superior! Also the filtering and map search option are EXTREMELY useful to allow you to find something in the neighborhood even the exact street/block you want to be in. I'll never use another vacation rental site other than Airbnb!!!! 

Only recommendation is to contact owners periodically to review and confirm their listing and calendar are up to date to their current preferences.
Version 2.1.0 2012-08-05 5
I'll Never go back to Hotels Again! Love the home like feel on vacation.
Version 2.1.0 2012-08-04 4
Love this app this whole concept... Thank you!
Version 2.2.0 2012-08-04 5
Beautiful and inspiring locations. I love the app but HATE the new icon. And I can't help but notice that there has been yet another update but the horrible icon is still there. Please bring back the luggage. There's nothing less original than having just a letter as an entire icon.
Version 2.1.0 2012-08-03 5
This works great. It opens up so many unique and favorable options every time I want to go somewhere. 
And the customer service has been fast and extremely helpful.
Version 2.1.0 2012-08-03 5
Even easier to book here than book via hotels
Version 2.1.0 2012-08-02 5
Thanks airbnb for helping through 
Some tuff times !!
Version 2.1.0 2012-08-02 5
I use this service every time I travel and the App makes it easy for me to find places to stay. It's very user friendly and I highly recommend everyone to check it out! :)
Version 2.1.0 2012-08-02 4
The fact that Airbnb continues to expand and upgrade, not only in their mobile ap, but all around! Their customer service, user-friendly site, brilliant concepts & exquisite execution all add up to an amazing experience! Tnx Airbnb!!!
Version 2.1.0 2012-08-02 5
simple to navigate.  very helpful.
Version 2.1.0 2012-08-01 5
I love this app! Airbnb is amazing and the app makes easy rentals even easier. Well done!

Great app
So easy to use
And a great way of traveling..
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-30 3
Seems like having an iPad version would make this a super sweet app since I generally use my iPad over my phone.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-30 4
Very good app
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-30 5
Extremely useful
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-30 5
Its cool awsome
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-29 5
I wish they had it for iPad also
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-28 5
Earlier the app locked up on me, but I have found it super easy to navigate.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-28 3
When I click to see recent message it won't display new message. Mostly a blank screen. Sometimes I can see old messages but not the new ones.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-28 5
This makes planning for the most unique.      way of lodging when exploring a new city or vacation spot!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-28 5
Nice work
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-27 5

Version 2.1.0 2012-07-27 5
How do I say this,   Ummmmmm LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-27 5
Pretty much sums it up. Helps me when I can't just open up the laptop. Thank you!!!!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-27 5
It's really great
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-27 5
Very user friendly and quick to notify with new listing inquiries. I was able to rent my apartment out quickly!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-25 5
I love this app, the site, and everything about it! No more expensive hotels 100%. Love the places I've been too not a complaint! Just amazing!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-25 5
So sick. Done booking expensive hotels .
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-24 4
Hard to figure out writing reviews but works well
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-24 5
Viva Airbnb
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-24 2
When taking photos of my place I want to be able to upload photos from device. Frustrating that I have to take each picture at a time rather than just taking a whole bunch and just selecting the one or two that are great. Please make me happy and add it.  Thank you.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-24 5
The app is great except I can't rate properties unless I sign in online, not using the app.  Maybe I just haven't figured it out yet.....
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-24 5
First of all, best idea ever! Who needs over priced hotels when you have a whole condo/house/apartment in the best locations!!! I'm in love with this app
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-23 4
Airbnb is a great service, but I'm hoping they'll eventually bring parity to the app and website. The app doesn't allow hosts to Pre-approve reservations so I always have to sign onto the full website to do this.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-23 2
The Service is great if there are no major issues.  But if you have a issue BEWARE!! Airbnb customer service is HORRIBLE, I mean just AWEFUL.  If you have problems don't expect customer support to come to the rescue.  Really, Airbnb CS should be ashamed of themselves.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-23 5
We have met some great folks. A wonderful way to travel.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-22 2
The problem with this app is that it's missing a lot of features on the full website I only use it for communication with the host and not leaving reviews or searching for places.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-21 5
Great!
Version 1.3.0 2012-07-21 3
Great concept and easy to use but it constantly crashes on me.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-21 1
App does not filter any results. It displays all 200,000 plus results whatever the search. Plus no way to delete your search history.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-21 3
Needs some work, search results do not show.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-21 5
If you're looking for a place to stay and meet some cool people this is it
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-21 1
I like airbnb but this app needs some work.   No matter what I type in to search, the search results are always the same.  Only way to browse what's available in the area you are interested is to go to the map and click on each pin.   I rather wait until I am in front of a computer than using this app if I want to search.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-20 5
What a fabulous app! I've stayed at B&B's for years, this is a nice little way to put lots of them all in one place and it does a lot of the handy work for you.. Some of the houses are breathtaking too. I highly recommend it
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-20 5
I think I've found my favorite iPhone app by far. It's absolutely magnificent, more addicting than any game!!! I can spend HOURS browsing through these adorable apartments!!!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-20 5
Great places to stay! Exactly what you want and when you want it
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-20 5

Awesome !!!

First time using this site
It was a big help for me 
I love it
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-18 1
I love airbnb, hate their app. Maybe for travelers it's good but for hosts its completely useless. You can't view the calendar of your listings and future reservations, you can't pre-approve guests if they make an inquiry, you can't edit your listings, etc etc. What a joke. Airbnb does such a wonderful job on their website to make it super easy to list your place, which is why it's mind-boggling that the app is so limited.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-17 5
I've been to many cities and via Airbnb, stayed with the locals who gave me very Comfortable accommodation.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-17 5
This is a great app. The first thing I go to when making travel arrangements!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-17 4
The iPhone version just doesn't cut it on the iPad retina display.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-16 5
I know have a reason to travel
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-16 5
Love it. The best thing.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-15 5
Easy to use, intuitive and fun to peak at all beautiful apartments all over the world. Looking forward to an IPad app soon I hope!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-15 5
The site is fantastic! The customer service is very friendly and will spend as much time needed on the phone with you. The site makes it very easy to find a home anywhere you are traveling to. I think they thought of everything needed if you plan or vacationing or you have a rental you would like to advertise.  It is truly a wonderful and easy site! This is a must for anyone that travels or has a vacation rental.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-15 5
Great app! Easy to use and fun!
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-15 5
I just got Into Airbnb and I love that there is an app. It keeps me notified on all activity on my acct. I just wish it was available on blackberry playbooks. Otherwise, great app!!!!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-15 5
So much fun to browse even if you're not going anywhere!!!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-14 5
Excellent iPhone app! I have a booking for our vacation in Sept & I'm able to communicate with the host & see photos of the apartment we rented. Please make an iPad version please!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-13 5
Really slick interface. Wish there was a way to control text notifications.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-13 5
Great app.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-12 5
booked all our accommodations through airbnb, mostly from my iphone - 7 european cities in august 2012! love the ease and portability of the app. i could browse, view my favorites, communicate w owners, and book all while i'm out doing errands. wouldn't have gotten it done this quickly and easily without airbnb app.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-11 5
If you travel this app it's a MUST!!!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-11 4
I Love Airbnb!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-11 1
Please bring the old look back!! This looks generic now
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-11 3
Would like to browse while listening to music or podcasts but when I access the app it cuts the sound off. Don't know why this app co-ops the sound.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-11 4
This is a really cool website !
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-10 4
The is getting better with updates.  As of late my only complaint is that you are unable to see reviews once you are emailed.  Otherwise keep going guys.  Great stuff!
Version 1.3.0 2012-07-10 2
Everytime i try to search for a place it crashes. Then i hav to do my search again which is extreamly annoying
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-10 3
I only just joined AirBnB last week, and have already made over $400 renting to a few really nice folks disparate to find a place to stay in my area. The app works great notifying me about things happening on my profile, but lacks a few major functions.

I know there's not a huge user base for this, but where's the iPad app? That's one star for me. The other is I can't upload photos from my iPhone/iPad. Sure I can take a photo, but I'm a photographer hobbiest with a really expensive camera that I somtimes use my iPad to do editing on. It came as a total shock when I found all I could do was "snap" a photo, but not choose one from my library. Seems like a basic thing, and thus, another star bites the dust.

Bring an iPad version and uploading from the library along with maybe some minor interface addons, and I will be happy to give 5 stars. Great great great concept though business wise!!

Amazing concept - nice app too!!
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-09 5
good app
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-08 5
This is an awesome app for a terrific service!

I stayed at two Airbnb-listed properties in Manhattan earlier this year -- fantastic experiences.  

The Airbnb app, sadly, is going backwards.  The app has gotten clumsier and buggier with every iteration.  For example, the "Collections" subsection under the Featured option has four major choices at the top of the screen.  Clicking on any of them yields, "Error, Unfortunately, this resource is no longer available."

You can't use the app to search easily -- the search option simply gives you the ability to enter a city.  If you're looking for a specific set of keywords, or are looking for a specific named property, you're out of luck.  

The seems to be no integration between their website and the app.  For example, the Airbnb website allows you to flag a property for your "Wish List."  The app allows you to see "Your Favorites" under the "Account" option, but "Favorites" seem to be unrelated to "Wish Lists."

Sad -- the Airbnb service has such promise, but the app is clearly not getting sufficient resources for design or testing.  Hope that they can pull this one out of the fire soon.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-07 1
I thought this app was good until I used it! I am a traveler and book through all kinds of websites. I thought it would be nice to have an app that booked exotic locations and rentals. DO NOT USE THIS APP! The company has terrible protocol and I was taken by them for my deposit. Never using it again. Trashed! Good bye and good luck with ripping off your customers.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-06 5
I can pull up all my reservation info quickly and book quickly.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-05 5
Great for finding last-minute places to stay!
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-05 5
I can manage my properties anywhere I am, that's great. But the version has bugs. Many times when I get a new msg I try to open it and it appears empty.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-04 3
The app is ok, stable not crashy, & handy, but it's limited. I can search by location & dates & broad categories - private rm, shared, # bedrooms & bath, but that's pretty much it. I'm traveling with a dog so wish I could limit by pet friendly the way you can on the website. I also want to review via the app but don't seem to be able to do that.
Version 2.1.0 2012-07-04 3
I love the iconic pink price tag? Why has it been axed? It was eye catching in the WWDC Thank You video and sorely missing now. 
Also the new tumblr/twitter-like wish lists are ok, but the curated lists of tree houses, glamping, etc. part of this app are missing. Why can't it just a user option to show one or the other? Seeing those collections makes it easier to show off the service to those people I share airbnb with. 

Other than these new changes, airbnb is fantastic.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-04 5
App is very useful to get back to potential guests timely. Functional, nice looking and user friendly. Only thing I'd change is the home page full of illustrative images that aren't purposeful an cause the app to load slowly. Images are beautiful but unnecessary in that home page. The trade off isn't worth the time it takes to load. App is very functional and super useful. Very thankful for it!
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-03 5
Nice application
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-03 5
The airbnb app looks great and was super valuable for my travels in Europe. Thanks AirBnB!
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-02 2
Two major issues: 
1) Constant connection problems (must be the Airbnb server)
2) Browsing the map for properties is
completely broken and useless. Message like "Zoom to see 300 properties". No matter if you zoom in or out, nothing is displayed. Sometimes,
zooming out *reduces* the number of properties drastically, which doesn't make any sense.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-02 3
Sometimes when I get a new message it will not load an only appears blank. This is really frustrating.... Please fix and I will give a 5 star review.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-02 4
First time using the service.  App was put together well without being too flashy.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-01 5
Downloaded this app yesterday afternoon and already have a condo for next June in fl for a FRACTION  of the on site Disney prices!!!!!!! LOVE it!  owner had good references and got right back to us!!!
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-01 5
The app is doing all the right things. Simple to navigate, fast, clear. Thanks for all you do!
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-01 4
What a great way to dream big and yet plan realistically.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-01 2
I would give the app 5 stars if it shows what currency is used to calculate prices, and also the app should allow to change currency settings.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-01 5
I've used AirBnB multiple times and I'm still surprised at the convenience of it; location, prices, and overall variety of places to stay at. It's a simple app that has all you need, if you're planning a trip ahead or spontaneously took a road trip tonight, this is better than hotels guaranteed. You get the comforts of a home + amenities of privacy of a hotel. It's nothing but win here.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-01 4
Airbnb is an amazing concept and works perfectly well for both travelers and hosts! Kudos to the smart guys who started the idea and developed it to this extend. 
The iphone app however, is a bit limiting and needs more work. Overall it works fine for the options available on the app, but I always find myself opening the full website on my phone.
Version 2.0.0 2012-07-01 4
Really useful and helpful app and service
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-30 5
My first month I posted my home for rent, I earned a quick $5307 which I then used to pay for a round trip airfare to take my girlfriend in Brasil for a three week all expense paid vacation - what a great invention airbnb is...! How come no one thought if this sooner !?!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-30 5
Would love to travel globe with Airbnb 1 day!
Great service, fantastic app!

One of the best useful app out there.. Really works very well..

Very impressed with the places I could use

Excelente aplicativo tanto pra quem anuncia, quanto pra quem procura!!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-28 5
My husband and I needed a cheap room in Northern California, and I refused to stay at a Motel 6. I suggested we try Airbnb and am so glad I did! We found an adorable back house to rent for less cash than we were going to pay for a rundown motel room. The ap works great and the site is amazing. 5 stars all the way around. Thank you, Airbnb!
Version 1.4.2 2012-06-28 5
Love to be responsive to our potential guests, and this app makes it easy.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-27 4
Make the app universal and its going to be automatic 5 stars
Version 1.3.0 2012-06-27 5
Only problem is you can't upload pictures from your phone. You have to do it from a computer. I find it easy to email and search on the app. Overall, great app!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-27 5
Airbnb has helped us a lot ! Great idea.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-26 5
From the UI to the whole experience, Airbnb has got to be a 'must' for family vacations, honeymooners or just backpackers. LOVE IT!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-25 5
Browsing, booking, and messaging are all very easy with the app.  Very nice UI too.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-24 5
I booked an entire trip, switching locations every day, using this app. So easy and helpful!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-24 5
Love it
Thanks
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-24 5
This makes browsing properties so easy I have lots of favorites now .....
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-23 5
I love this site. What an easy and convenient way to book a room. And at prices significantly cheaper than a hotel!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-22 5
Airbnb is a great community-based resource, and a well established way to connect to people from such beautiful and diverse backgrounds from a myriad of spots. I have been using this app to plan my trip for the past 3 weeks, some at the last minute and others with advance planning. Will continue to rely on this site as a way to enhance my travels!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-22 3
I love love but the app has to improve, I.e. I can't see my price settings and I can't make setting changes.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-22 3
I like the clean, easy navigation. However, if you want to share a property listing with friends or your spouse, you can't do it from the app. Pretty critical oversight.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-22 5
I love that I get to hand select exactly where I sleep, from the neighborhood, to the decor, to the local I stay with. Enjoy the fact that it's all available at my finger tips on my phone.
Version 1.4.2 2012-06-21 5
I love the interface and the usability of this app. The search function is easy to navigate and intuitive and the videos and extra content is well made. A great, useful app.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-21 3
Still have bags. As a photographer of Airbnb is too hard for me to work with this app. It makes messages disappear as I get a new one or send a reply. It doubles the messages but shows nothing in it. 
Please fix it. 
Thank you
Version 1.3.0 2012-06-20 2
I love this app, but it always crashes when I use it. If that didn't happen then it would definitely get 5 stars.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-20 5
Quite useful and serious and accurate !
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-20 5
This is a keeper!

Love this service ;)
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-19 4
I love planning vacations for the family on my own! I am always looking for a small or just quick place to stay because we only really use the area for such a short time it's not worth it to pay so much- love how this works! Hope the friendly people that are on the site stay for as long as they can! Great job!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-19 5
Need iPad app too!
Thanks,
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-19 5
I am only using this app for 2 days and I loooovvveee it! I'll keep usin' it! Great!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-19 4
I think I'll be able to use this app for an upcoming trip; I see allot of options at my destination. I've rated it based on the information made available and the # of pictures being provided.  The pictures really help..the more the better.

It would be nice if users could search by City or state, then narrow the search to the # of bedrooms, or whether pets were allowed, house, apartment, etc.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-18 5
Love this app. We use it as hosts and guests and find it easy to use and pretty robust for an app.
Version 1.4.2 2012-06-18 5
it's a new world
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-17 5
make one for iPad too???
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-17 5
Please add a calendar feature to the app! As a host this app is extremely limiting without access to property bookings, the ability to change a nights price, etc. 

On the plus side... the layout is beautiful, the ability to upload photos is great, and Airbnb rocks!!!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-17 5
Love the site, and this is a perfect app to go with it.  The app makes it very simple to see all of the details and contact info of upcoming stays, as well as a great interface for finding new places. Haven't used it yet for hosting, so I'll update the review once I do!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-17 5
Love this App!!!!!!!!!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-16 5
I have my apartments posted on the site and thus site became the main source of my customers! Love it!!!

Fantastic, model, gorgeous App!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-16 5
Great app!  Makes managing my account on the go a breeze.

What a great idea...kudos, Airbnb!
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-15 5
I can get the ball started on here and keep my listing up to date. A must have for all host.  Plus the new look is user friendly.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-15 5
Very helpfull app in travel.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-15 4
Love this site...now I love this app. Great to have everything at my fingertips.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-15 1
This app has a lot of issues and it constantly crashes. Even if you close the app lately and restart it, doesn't seem to the trick.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-15 5
Set up an account and began planning right away!

Just wish it let you set up your own place for renting.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-14 2
It crashed a lot, but it was tolerable. However with the last two updates it doesn't work at all. Not helpful when one is traveling and needs access. Please fix this buggy and unstable app.
Version 2.0.0 2012-06-14 5
I traveled Europe last year and wish I knew about this. This year I am already planning my next trip around this app. Well done!
Version 1.4.2 2012-06-02 5
A great place to find a great place...
Version 1.4.0 2012-06-01 3
Decent interface but it should be more host friendly: you can't see the prospective prices of an inquiry, view your own calendar, or look at your payment transactions. 

Also, there is no proper iPad version! Update this please!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-06-01 5
Awesome
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-30 4
We love airbnb and have stayed and booked with them before, with awesome results!
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-30 5
Helpful for low budget traveller
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-30 1
The new on is uninspiring.
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-29 5
One of the better UIs and makes you want to travel more. Time to open the app again
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-29 5
Our first time stay was in Paris, in an amazing flat we found through airbnb it was safe & easy to use. I recommend it to everyone :)
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-28 2
The app will not let you login with Facebook. It has the button to login with Facebook, it goes out, tries to login via your Facebook app, but still asks for username and password when you get back to the airbnb app. 

Waste of time if you used Facebook login to set up the app.
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-28 5
Awesome easy to use app.
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-28 5
I love this app! It is super easy to use and I am sure it will get me out of a lot of sticky situations in the future! Can't wait to use it again!
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-27 4
Love it
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-27 5
Great service, great ap. change the icon back -- way too plain!!!
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 4
...HATE the new app logo. Please bring back the suitcase.
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-26 3
The idea behind the app is great BUT I find myself deleting the app all the time to reset it.

It's more useful if you are using it as a guest. The platform for hosting is still very simple. I still can't find my hosting calendar, and much less manage it !!!

I log in with my Facebook account and unless I'm on a wifi network, I can't log in. 

I've pretty much given up using it. When I get a reminder on the lock screen I'd rather wait to be in from of a computer to check messages...
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-26 5
It's the first place I check when I travel now. 3 weeks in Italy were awesome and off the beaten path with Air BnB. 

Only suggestion: please bring back the old icon. It was my favorite app icon on my phone.
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 4
Really happy with the app about 90 percent of time. Would be even better if I didn't have the occasional bug with emailing prospective guests (sometimes they don't get the email which can cause drama ) Also world love to be able to delete emails from the inbox & leave reviews for people via the app. I like the new icon- simple is best.
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 5
Easy to use and awesome design

Old Icon is much better than the new one
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 5
Allows us hosts to take it to the next level with this app. Thanks!
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 5
Now with facebook sso working...
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 5
It works great. So easy to book.
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 4
What's with the horrible icon? Ever heard of something called TASTE?
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 5
i rented my place through this!
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 5
Great experience with this app. They obviously put a lot of care into developing it.
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 4
It's a good mobile app. The only problem I have is that it keeps crashing when I look at the map. Please fix :)
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-26 5
Don't leave home without checking out this app. Whether you need a room for a night or a house for a month, you'll find lots of great options available.
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-25 5
I miss your old icon!! - that is all.
Version 1.4.0 2012-05-25 4
You had the prettiest app icon in the entire app store.  It was colorful, meaningful and looked amazing with a bit of 3d perspective.  By far the easiest to spot out of all my apps.

Now it is indistinguishable, practically colorless, and meaningless.  I'm not going to take away stars for this, overall the app is great and I've recommended many friends to try this service.  I'm just sad to see it go...

It would be great if you could prevent the app from taking control of audio until I actually watch a video.  I want my music to keep playing.
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-25 3
I like AB but current version keeps crashing.
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-24 4
Hi Everybody! This application is a great short cut, if you have an iPad, but do not aspect to be able to see it all... Is just a short cut. I could manage few thing pretty well, like calendar and info, but you cannot see for example, how much a possible guest will make you earn, for example. Good if you are on a run, or just your lists are so hot you have to get fast in touch with a possible new guest.
Hope this can be improved with full possibilities, like the great system they gave you to access from your computer!
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-24 4
Simple and straight forward. Just wish I could see the cost of hosting or traveling reservations.
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-24 2
This app crashes on me ALOT!!! Getting really tired of it it just stops working and doesn't even let me log in w fb.
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-23 5
Great resource
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-23 5
The app is pretty great as well.
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-23 3
Crashes every time when I want to see upcoming bookings and customer service page; does not open every time when I sign up...
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-23 4
Great app...but does seem to crash every once in a while, still love it. How about an iPad version?
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-23 4
Love the ui. Super stable. Occasional glitches with "log in w fb" feature, but that's minor. 

Overall, im addicted.
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-22 3
Just started using the app and it is pretty good
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-22 5
I absolutely love this app. iPad version please!!!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-21 3
I have faced serious password problems. Can only log in through facebook. Even after i registered directly on website.

AirBnB makes it so convenient and easy to post your space. I am totally ready for tourist season and already have two full weeks booked for the summer! Now where am I going to travel this Summer?!
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-19 4
Really enjoy the ease of use of this app.
Where's the iPad version?
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-19 5
Love AIRBNB
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-18 4
Airbnb app is so convenient to use it, it helped me a
Lot
I book my
Reservations, and also to get in touch with the hosts.
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-18 5
I came across a segment on Good Morning America regarding saving money during summer travels. The information provided about AirBnB.com really caught my attention. Discovering the ease of maneuvering thru the site only added to my curriousity. Within a short time I booked my first travel to NYC and found a perfect place to stay. I shared with a friend who immediately listed their property on Cape Cod and have already served guest.  These experiences have motivated me to list a guest room in my own home. It is an excellent opportunity to suplimemt income and to make new acquaintances from all walks from many places across the glob,
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-17 2
I'd really like to give this a proper review, but can't because.. It ... Keeps ... Crashing!!!!!!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-17 1
This app is a great idea and concept if it worked! It crashes way too much preventing you from viewing all the details off the rental. Fix the crashing and I may be able to give it more stars, because it's useless if I can't see all the information.
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-17 3
Keeps crashing now. Used to work fine earlier
Version 1.3.0 2012-05-16 3
Not very stable.!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-23 1
I love this app & have used it before without prob. But it keeps kicking me out. Bummer
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-22 5
I am totally impressed with Airbnb's site & service  I travel a lot and as a single, senior woman I have found Airbnb provides me fantastic lodging. Before them, I was spending a fortune on B&B's because I felt much safer there than hotel or motels. I have saved hundreds & enjoyed the family-like feel to their host's places
Their accommodations have been beautiful & family like. Their headquarters staff are extremely helpful & professional. 
My only problem is that there are not more of them, especially nearer to national parks. I am on a quest to visit every one of them
You go AIRBNB ! You rock!

It's great when it works, but it seems to crash every 10mins or so. So frustrating!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-21 3
Love airbnb, and love the app. But it seems like it crashes 1 out of 3 times I'm using it. Please fix this, airbnb!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-21 3
The app is not a mirror of the site and should not be expected to be so IMO. However it's pretty good, simple to navigate but prone to crash. I'd like a better starting page as the collections page seems illogical place to start.. Would be better to start at inbox or account page.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-20 5
Upon booking a trip, I usually use my computer, but with this app I can message the owners, change my profile, view al the places I want to go- its basically the same thing! Really handy to have if you like to travel a lot. Love it! Have had it for almost a year!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-19 2
Airbnb on my iPhone is such a bad experience I've stopped recommending the service to people out of embarrassment of the iPhone app.  It loses my login all the time, asks for new approval from Facebook almost every time, and often still won't login. I don't trust it. Just use the web app on a pc.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-19 2
This version of the App still has a long way to go, it's only halfway, you still cant do half the the stuff you can on the website sadly.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-19 5
Iphone app works great, can update profile & everything.  Thanks abnb!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-19 1
I love airbnb but as a host this app is pretty useless. Please Airbnb get all over this. Your app is like a lame nights stay at a second rate bnb. Not your style. Mobile webpage also useless. Needs help.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-19 1
Full of bugs. Crashes at least 9/10 times. Very annoying when you are trying to log in and it won't work even after 100 tries. Once inside, 9/10 the app actually works.  Please work on this app more. It's a great website and customer service is incredible.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-18 5
I just became a member, got the app add made two bookings! Love it. No crashes or bugs. Great UI.

love the airbnb site but suffer trying to use the ap. It crashes and is full of weird inconsistent glitches. One day I can see my upcoming events, the next I cant. I will be very happy once it runs well
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-18 3
App keeps crashing.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-18 5
The idea as the essence is brilliantly simple, rent the space you do not use! You can sub rent a bed or a huge villa at the same time, by the day, by the month, eliminating the days you have friends over, or you are throwing a party for your birthday and you need the place to yourself. Total freedom for both sides, for both parties, though complete strangers, all become a Woldwide group of friends. Safest way to do your payments too and ensure that all went as planned even days after the trip. The air bnb team has improved all procedures, with a caring support team and someone there for you 24/7. That is what I call a strong team! Thank you air bnb!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-18 2
Great app but keeps crashing. Please fix.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-17 3
I love the service and would get a lot of use out of the app. And it's even well-designed. But it times out, crashes, and throws errors all the time. Can rarely log in or check inbox successfully.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-16 5
:)
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-16 3
The mobile app crashes far too much though.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-16 1
The app looks nice but it doesn't do what should! When I put the dates of my trip it shows me all apts even those which are not available!! Also when I look for an apt for 1 night it shows me apts with minimum 3 nights of stay.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-16 4
A few crashes, but a very great functional app. Awesome!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-16 3
I like this app, but have had it crash several times while trying to use it. I also wish there was a way to email or text the listing to a friend. Overall, I like the app.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-15 4
Really enjoy using this app! Easy to navigate through site, very user friendly! However, I have also experienced quite a few crashes, but besides that, it's a great app!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-14 5
No crashes for me.
An incredible service.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-14 1
It crashes. It freezes. It's slow. It lacks essential features. (Seriously? You made an App for a hotel like service, and it does not have a calendar? Well, I suppose dates don't matter when you're trying to book guests...) 

Aside from all that, it's fine.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-14 1
Crashes every time I click on Amenities or property details. iPhone 4S. Not usable until the bug is fixed.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-14 2
Gorgeous graphics. App appears very good & useful--IF it didn't crash constantly. :(
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-13 2
The app is beautiful but countinuously crases
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-13 1
I tried four different times, and each time it left the program and crashed my phone.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-12 1
It is really annoying, still does not work ,
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-11 1
I can't login with my Facebook login, nor directly with my email address. It simply freezes and nothing happens afterwards
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-11 4
If only the app had that functionality!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-10 5
Very useful service!
PS: pls fix the crash when open the app from push notifications
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-10 1
It works all the way through until you hit "Book It". I called tech support.. They knew it is a problem but are "still working on fixing it". Argh!!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-10 1
Please update this soon. The whole point of this app is the convenience of being able to search and book while mobile. I can't do that if after a minute, it crashes! :(
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-09 4
The site is great and the app is pretty darn good way to book when you're out and about. It is easier to book days ahead of time and then you might as well use a computer. But when we wanted to book for right away, the easy-to-access customer service made it happen for us. They were great. 

Only problem, I wish I didn't have to log in every time because that means logging out of my Facebook to log in to my wife's an it's a pain.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-09 5
Awesome app , great concept! Thanks Airbnb
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-09 1
Too bad the app doesn't work properly.. For such an useful tool it's a shame that the app can't work. Hopefully they fix it soon.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-09 5
Easy to use and perfect for last minute accommodations!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-08 5
Everything you need to use Airbnb is at your fingertips! Love it!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-08 2
Please fix!!! Keeps crashing once I open a location to review.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-07 5
Using it regularly.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-06 5
Great app guys. As satisfied with your app as I am with your product (as in: VERY). Keep up the great work!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-06 2
Application is useless -- it closes less then a minute after opening. 
I see that I am not the only one having this problem after update. Fix is needed!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-06 2
I love airbnb and used the app in Australia and NZ last year and it worked but as others have noted, the latest update crashes when you try to open upcoming trips - hope they fix it before I head to Italy in next three weeks otherwise very disappointing.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-05 5
We have enjoyed 3 apartments in New York and Seattle and been very pleased with each!  When we had a problem with a booking the customer service team was amazing!
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-04 5
I booked a beautiful flat in Paris using the app and it worked flawlessly. Can't wait to use this for all my travels! :)
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-04 2
Can't upload photos for apartment I wish to host.  Other than that it's ok.
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-03 4
4 stars for repeating glitches with facebook log in. Amazing App and good service
Version 1.3.0 2012-04-02 1
This app was nice... Smooth and worked well. Did the recent update and it is now barely usable. As others are saying IT CRASHES PROFUSELY!!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-31 1
Crashes every time I scroll past a map, basically unusable. Please fix!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-31 1
I am making a trip soon and any time I try to view anything other than my inbox the app crashes. Looking at my upcoming trips? Nope, app crashes. Want to see my itinerary? Nope, app crashes. I love airbnb, but this app is terrible...
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-31 5
I booked my trip and stay and found the app to be very helpful. 
Love it

Version 1.3.0 2012-03-30 1
I'm a host & my iPhone app keeps continually crashing. It used to crash every once in a while but after I installed the latest upgrade, it crashes every time I use it. It would also be nice if they added the standby feature on the app for hosts & guests alike. After all, the more $$ I make as a host & the more $$ guests spend, It's more $$ that Airbnb makes. I Hate the App! but love the site. Fix it already guys!!! Come on, y'all already slipping!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-29 4
I just recently started using Airbnb and Im hoping to rent this summer. Besides the fact, this App is sweeet. People respond so quick such great listing with great prices!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-29 5
I realy love thi app and i am going to rent this summer
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-28 1
I love the airbnb concept, but my iPhone app keeps crashing when looking at property details. This is extremely annoying especially if you are on the road without a laptop and are relying on this app to look for your next place to stay. Had to "divert" to regular hotels (using Kayak's app) several times just because of this. Without the crashing I would rate this app a 5 star.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-27 5
Love it.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-27 5
I use Airbnb all over the world. I recommend this as the best accommodation when traveling.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-27 4
Just being great!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-26 3
I like the app but I wish it would show my photography jobs and also it doesn't seem to show the bookings for my own listing.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-26 5
I'm in the airline industry and was told of this site from a co-worker.   I enjoy staying in places that give the feel/experience of being a local, not a tourist, so I will be using airbnb.com for most of my trips, no matter where my adventure takes me!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-26 5
Awesome app and well done
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-26 5
I just found out about this service from a friend and was please to find they had an app, it's easy to use and so far the experience is very good.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-25 5
The app is very easy to use. I can't imagine a better experience with such a service.
Version 1.2.3 2012-03-25 5
I love airbnb and the app is perfect pairing for quickly finding AMAZING places to stay! I will never stay in another hotel, it's budget friendly and when you find a great host you will make a new friend. There are many rental places out there but Airbnb is by far the best!!!!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-25 5
Very nice app! To be perfect they just need to built an Ipad App :)
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-25 5
Amazing for any length travel abroad!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-24 5
So handy!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-24 1
Tried it, deleted it.  Constantly crashes.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-24 1
Not sure how the rating is still so high since it seems that everyone else is having the same problem I'm having: constant crashes! Been trying to list my place but no avail. Beautiful or not, this app has been worthless. Shame too, since in general, I like airbnb.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-24 5
Great!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-23 5
I love this apps. I used it for the first time and it was an amazing experience!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-23 3
i LOVE this service, but the app crashes a lot.

.. Read all my reviews on crosswa.lk ..
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-21 5
Awesome on road trips. Extension of the website
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-21 5
Not sure about the negative reviews here. I'm using a 4S with the latest OS and no problems. It does what I need it to and that's it.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-21 2
Looks great but has no functionality. Crashes, times out, and sadly the website isn't much better. It took far too much effort to book a room and now that I have this app continues to cause problems in contacting my host. If this costs me money it's going down to one star.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-21 2
Edit:  I have an iPhone 4 running version 4.2.8. and am still experiencing constant crashes. I have realized that it is not limited to the map or any particular scrolling.  I have a stay coming up that I cannot view.  If the app worked, it would be gorgeous, intuitive, and utilitarian and well-worth five stars.  But it crashes constantly and it's been at least a month with no update in sight.

---- Old Review ----

Love Airbnb, but this app crashes every time I try to scroll below the map, no matter how many times I reboot my phone and reinstall the app. I assume the reviews are down there, and they are a key part of the decision to stay at particular places. 

Therefore, the app itself is of limited usage. Fix this, and it's five stars. 'Till then, I have to go to the website to read reviews and book, which is cumbersome.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-19 1
this is already since 2 weeks now. As you rank down your customers when they not respond in time you should really try and fix it!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-19 5
Very interactive app. It has never crashed on me and is so easy to use.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-18 5
I used this in SF and it saved me hundreds. They seem to be responsive to feedback and improving the app.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-18 5
As a User Experience designer, I have pretty high expectations when it comes to application design. This one is an example of almost perfect user experience that allows for a fully functioning mobile extension of the web experience. If you use AirBNB, you MUST HAVE this app.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-18 5
I can spend hours browsing property on this app. Unique app if you're renting anything from a room to a castle. The only thing missing is a "Share" button to message or email this App to others.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-17 5
This app is so much fun to browse through!!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-17 5
This app is everything and More! Great properties, with a fantastic organized app. My only suggestion is a way to email or text or send somehow, to a friend. Because my friend and I are planning a trip and I wish we could have a way of keeping track of each others cool property finds. (I can only keep track of my own in the started area)
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-17 5
Excellent. All the info. I need and helps me respond quickly to prospective guests.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-17 2
Great idea, but the app isn't functional yet. It crashes in multiple instances and doesn't allow for some pretty simple functionality.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-15 1
Not worth it.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-14 5
Helps me a lot and works great!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-14 5
Works Well.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-14 5
I can't believe that someone had not thought of this sooner.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-13 1
The app would always crash from time to time but since the last update it has came to a point that is just purely embarrassing to have a product out there that functions so poorly. It crashes when simply trying to load
Inbox or scroll down on the screen. As for functionality it also lacks critical information such as the amount paid or received for a previous rental. With an easily duplicable business model, if airbnb still puts out trashy app like this,  something else will take over easily!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-13 3
I know it's compatible but when will you have an actual iPad app???
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-12 4
While it does crash a bit after updates, it's been so helpful on all of my travels since I've downloaded it. Totally worth it.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-11 3
App worked really well prior to the last update. It now frequently kicks me out after a minute or so. Very frustrating, please fix!
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-11 2
New update keeps crashing :(
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-10 5
I just greeted my first guests and they are great. They're in Austin for SXSW and I hear that AirBnB is here representing and I want to go tell them in person how much I like this ap
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-10 4
Overall this is a useful app. As a host, notifications are key in responding to inquiries in a quick efficient way. The major drawback is the lack of calendar function in the app. This would make it much more user/ host friendly.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-10 5
This apps is perfect. It gives me the functionality of the website to manage my listings while I am at the hospital.
Version 1.3.0 2012-03-10 5
I LOVE IT
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-23 1
Can't log in via Facebook. Suggests an upgrade "to (null) version" when there is no new version. Crashes continually. Junk. Disappointing. Deleted.
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-23 5
This app has been awesome for rental management. The alerts are great & I can do practically everything on the app that I can do on the site - which is important when I need to get back to potential renters quickly. Thanks Airbnb!!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-23 5
This is an awesome app.  Can't believe all the wonderful places I'm starring and at such great prices, cant wait to explore them all!!!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-22 5
Shows great prices and sites
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-21 4
The opportunity that AirBnb gives is incredible and I am very impressed with the organization of the network.
The app is helpful and although there is a delay at times on getting messages as they come in, I really am happy with the overall experience.
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-20 5
Great app!! Would be great if you all could make one for iPad as well!!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-19 3
Search engine is not working well
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-16 3
Why on earth does a travel social networking need to take over my audio?
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-16 5
Great follow up and user friendly web/ app interphase
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-16 5
Airbnb is an amazing tool for travelers on the go. My wife and I had no place to stay inPrague and heard from a friend to try airbnb so we did. Never been more pleased with a lodging experience! Fast, cheap, friendly! What more do you want when traveling? I've recommended airbnb to everyone I know and hopefully they start using this great service too!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-15 5
The best idea and the best tool for host ever.
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-15 5
Great app. As an host, this def helps me being very responsive and able to reply almost right away to inquiries. Only issue would be abt the 'special offer', it would be good to also have the Pre-approval just like on the website so you do not have to manually compute the amount to charge the potential guest. Other than that, I like Airbnb a lot, I have been averaging $1200 a month by renting out my spare room!!!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-11 5
The App is extremely nifty!  Been using the site for a while now but the App is perfect!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-11 5
This app is really great!  I just got it and I can't wait to put it to good use.
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-11 5
This app is one of my favorites it is definitely a gem I highly recommend it.
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-10 5
Ultimate social travel tool. Future is airbnb... After all who wants to stay @hotels in this economy ?
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-08 5
This App is fantastic, and changes the experience of traveling in remarkable ways. Too bad I can't give 6 stars because I would in a heartbeat.
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-08 4
Get it
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-08 5
Great app and beautiful design.
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-07 5
By far my new favorite app. I'm saving money, staying at prime locations and it's all due to this app. Thanks airbnb!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-07 4
Easy to use, great but missing an important feature when searching for listings- the calendar/availability. I've wasted my time searching for and finding awesome places then to have to wait to be by a computer to find out if it's booked :( bummer!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-06 5
So easy to use, great pics, can save favs! Just as easy to use as the web version. Have booked places to stay with this app. It's great! I can spend hours on it looking at places all over the world!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-05 4
This app has all the ease and functionality of the website. My only criticism is that when a guest sends an inquiry about your space you can only reply with a special offer and not a pre-approval forcing you the math in your head (not a big deal but still a frustration).
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-04 5
A new yorker came into my work and we spoke about each of our cities. I mentioned that I wanted to go to NY and she suggested AIRBNB. I am even more prepared to go now. I'm excited and eternally grateful for AirBnb.

DON'T be a lazy traveler, download the app and you will never regret it...whether you're being hosted or hosting it's worth it!!!
Version 1.2.3 2012-02-03 5
Love this app, helps me out in a big way
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-13 5
We've booked a bunch already. Super user friendly. Love it
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-13 5
The airbnb app is so helpful that I can contact my host easily. I strong recommend that you download this app.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-12 5
Makes planning trips so much easier.. And cheaper!
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-12 5
Love this app!! It does it all!!
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-12 5
Since I travel a lot, I see this site one of the most helpful and interesting sites. It helps to save time, effort and mostly helps you to save money.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-12 5
Works so good
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-12 5
I've been working with airbnb for a year and it's app it's the best user friendly tool you'll ever need. Get it, you'll see!
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-10 5
Like the Airbnb website, their iPhone app is meticulously designed and a dream to use. I've booked an apartment while on a train, while sipping coffee at a roadside stand and while waiting for my bags too appear on the carousel! Their "last minute" feature works incredibly well if you find yourself needing a place for tonight in a foreign land!
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-10 5
Wish I could get all my friends to get this app so we could travel more. It seems great.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-09 5
It's very easy to get information and can change the way to live. With such application on you phone can be realistic spend a long vacation visiting what you like without any waste of time.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-09 5
As a property owner, I can manage almost everything on my iPhone that can be done via computer. My calendars, photos, replying to messages; even account info. Great app for a great company!
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-09 5
So useful.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-08 5
Finally an easy way to book great accommodations anywhere in the world where we travel.  So much better than Craigslist.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-08 5
This app is amazingly well suited to look for properties to rent. Their notifications are great and it allows you to directly contact hosts and easily find directions to the rented properties. Highly recommended for world travelers.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-07 5
This app is not only aesthetically beautiful with smart functionality, it helps me keep my response rate at 100%
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-07 4
This app came in handy for us during our trip to Paris.  I wish I had discovered it much sooner and looking forward to using in my future travels!
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-07 5
This app is so clean and simple to use!
I'm def going to recommend it to family and friends. Gr8 job by everyone over at Airbnb!!!!
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-06 5
I love this app! I've had wonderful stays in unique places and met interesting hosts. This app is so well designed, allowing you to search by map or city, and so easy to make calls to your host from within the app without figuring out country/city codes. The variety of properties is outstanding and Airbnb is an essential travel tool for me.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-05 5
If your traveling and looking for cheaper accommodations or alternatives to hotels... This is your app... Saved me a ton on travel expenses already
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-05 3
Good app to keep connected to your airbnb account. It's crashed a few times, hence the 3 stars, otherwise great app
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-04 5
Amazing app for an amazing service. I love airbnb.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-03 5
Effective friendly. Well done.
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-03 5
Love it..
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-02 5
Learned of this on LiveFearless with Sam Botta - Thank You! Literally able to stay in places you see on those entertainment interviews inside celebrity homes... in areas where the hotel prices would have been more expensive! Further this site is Safer than Craigslist because the verification process works with this specific purpose. App knows how to make your search easy, booking is fast on this app. Enjoy! Be inspired!
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-02 5
Great idea, we loved the idea and would recommend it! We have tried it and it really WORKS!!
Version 1.2.3 2012-01-01 5
Thx to Airbnb I only paid $100 to stay in downtown Savannah last night instead of the $250 hotel rates. I love this company and app!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-31 5
Love the app, love the service! Thank you for making it easy to keep in touch with our guests.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-31 5
Like it.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-31 5
I think I have tried every version of this type of website and Airbnb is the best/most user friendly. 
The home owners I have talked with have all been personable and made me want to stay in their place. The prices are realistic and under even a lot of hotels in the area.  
The app is top-notch and exciting. 
I recommend Airbnb and this app highly.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-31 4
Great way to see a location like a local...looking forward to our upcoming trip...
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-30 5
Really awesome!! Makes a dream getaway night not just a dream for a single mom with a budget!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-29 5
I tell everyone about AirBNB because it is the best. This app works very well. AirBNB has helped our travels be safe, cost effective, and fun. I prefer staying with AirBNB over a hotel or hostel anytime because there is an irreplaceable sense of community. Staying with AirBNB hosts help make you comfortable and offer advice when visiting the local scene...that is why you stay with AirBNB.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-29 5
Perfect in every way.

Thanks airbnb!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-20 5
An even more beautiful extension of an already sleek and comprehensive website. Beauty and utility- my two favorite things!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-17 5
I'd expect no less after using the web app, but I'm consistently impressed by the design and UX these guys pump out. Also it's good to find a place to stay or to manage your own listing
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-17 5
Thanks airbnb ,

We can be connected 24h all over the world !
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-16 5

Version 1.2.3 2011-12-14 5
Amazing app
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-13 5
Very well designed app, user friendly! They have great customer service. It's a simple way to book last minute all over the world!! And you will likely get a much better accommodations, get the feel of a city or town in a unique way!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-12 5
I'm very new to airbnb, but the more I understand it, the more and more I love it an applaud the manner in which it is being run. Being a nervous Nelly in just anyone staying at my ( really my brothers but for all intents and purposes mine) place I was somewhat hesitant at first. I was calling everyday with new questions- each one answered so knowledgeably and friendly by one of your staff there and appreciate the time and attention spent. I look forward to both renting to and from you in the future. Thanks airbnb!!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-12 5
Will change the way I book lodging forever!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-11 5
I great idea for an App!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-11 5
This app is great, I love how everything is at your fingertips.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-10 5
Yup!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-08 2
Push notifications are cool, but every single time I open the app from one of them, it crashes. Then I have to go through the startup animation all over again and go out to Facebook to log in again. All in, it takes about 2 minutes to start the app. Two minutes!! Once you're in, it's great though. Fix the crashes and login bugs, please.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-08 5
I've used Airbnb in 5 different cities throughout 3 different countries in the last 8 months. The app has saved me in each location, even abroad without cellular service. So easy to use and so convenient. Sickkkk!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-05 5
Airbnb is a feature rich site and their mobile app does a good job of delivering all the essentials to manage your listing and reservations from anywhere.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-05 5
This app is fantastic, integrating PayPal would be fantastic.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-04 5
Everything is so easy to search for. 
You discover just as much as you would if you were on a computer.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-04 4
As a host, having the app on my phone makes it soooooo easy to stay competitive and accept reservations and reply to messages immediately. The only issue I have is that it doesn't have everything- I'd love to be able to access my $$$ account and payment info through the app. Just a thought for the next version :)
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-04 5
It's sooo easy to find what are you looking for , I just love it

Booked through AirBnb for the 1st time a couple weeks ago for a trip to NYC. App had lots of apts to choose from and is super easy to navigate. Was nervous, but took a chance. Everything was so smooth. Will use again with no hesitation. Apt was legit, just as advertised. Communications were great from both the owners and app. Tub backed up one day. We reported to AirBnB and they contacted owner. Was fixed within hours and both AirBnB and owners followed up to make sure it was ok. Security deposit was returned on time. Every traveler should have this app!!
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-03 5
Wonderful pictures and a great way to dream until my next trip.
Version 1.2.3 2011-12-02 5
This is a great app, even better than the website. Every traveler should have it
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-28 5
This app is well designed and lets me do everything I need to do. It would be nice if i could change currency but that's minor compared to everything the app offers.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-28 5
I now use AirBnB for all my travel stays.  Saving money at great places is only the side benefit. The real treat is the interesting people you get to meet.  This App just makes using the services that much easier.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-27 4
Love it. I've hosted. I've traveled. Fab
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-27 5
Love it from Paris to Barcelona, SF.. NYC before I even lived there this ap rocked it...
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-26 5
Makes managing listings super easy. Great app!
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-25 3
The only recommendation for hosts is the ability to upload previously taken photos from your phone instead of only being able to take a photo.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-23 5
I love this app. It opens up a whole new world to being able to travel affordably!
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-22 5
It's like like going into your favorite store... You know where everything is!
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-21 5
Thank you for your efforts in creating such an efficient site. Clearly layed out and labeled nicely and user friendly.

Love it!
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-21 5
This is an amazing service I will use again & again! I travel quite frequently for business & pleasure. A friend recommended I use Airbnb.  I was hesitant at first but when calling customer service they we're kind & informative.  I booked our first home and it was exactly as represented! Beautiful and extravagant! Our stay was amazing!  Airbnb will be on my TOP 10 app/services that I recommend to all of my friends!
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-20 5

Please allow the ability to edit your own listing.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-15 3
Im a regular user of the website Airbnb and have guests at least twice or thrice a month. 

The app is a handy one to communicate with guests and know the upcoming reservations but since the last update it's just acting weird and annoyingly! 

1. Almost every time I open the app I've to log in thru Facebook. It takes time to exit the app open fb load fb approve on that page and get back! This bug is the most irritating thing so far. Was not there in the previous version. Log in once and u r done! 

2. When it logs in it detects a bug or crash report and promptly asks to send to developers or click not send. Do you even get a report?!
When I click send mostly I am welcome with a black screen with grey bands on the bottom and top , no icons pictures menu nothing 
And thats not fixed till I remove the app and load it from iTunes not nice at all!! 

2, That crashing happened even with normal log in , couple times. Enough for me to avoid te app and actually turn on my computer and check Airbnb there! 

Pros 
1. Having the notifications is good I get a s notification if I have a message reservation payment etc. that's a good addition with ios5. 
2.Also like the ability to upload photos from camera or to take with the phone camera itself 

3. All info about Airbnb guarantee is not there but that's fine because we want the app to be light on the memory. It's okay not to have the extra fluff on the app. Thanks for that. 

4. Nice collections. But maybe u could remove a few if they are causing an overload of resources. Seems like too many top 40's with high res pictures right at the beginning... We could do with fewer... 

Pls pls
Pls fix those bugs I'm such an ardent fan of the site and the concept and use my iPhone app too. I had bugs now and I had to write a review immediately!
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-15 4
Nice app but we're still waiting the iPad version!!! Please hurry up
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-13 5
This app is designed as well as the website, which is awesome.  I wish Facebook was designed this well both in terms of appearance and intuitive function.  My only issue was that at the beginning the login process didn't work, and then eventually it did.  But other than that it's great!
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-12 5
Such a beautiful app.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-12 5
Love the app! Navigating through it is a breeze; I'm still in shock with how easy it is to find a place right near me when I need it. Airbnb is overall amazing for travel!
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-07 4
Love the app but for some reason messages in my inbox are gone?
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-07 3
Nice app, nice pics. But Push notifications in combination with the app lead to too many crashes and logins.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-07 5
good App and Service
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-06 5
Only downsides are fewer filtering options than available through their main site, and no translations available for property descriptions as is available on the main site.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-05 4
We've used AirBnB for seven rentals in Europe. In Croatia, Italy (4 places), Malta, and Prague. Other than one place in Bari, Italy we had good service & good accommodations. It's mostly up to to the rental unit's owner to provide what they say they they are offering. Overall, we are pleased with what we have gotten. Thanks!
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-03 5
Love the AirBnB app, it easily organizes everything in one place. Works great for owners and renters.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-03 2
As a traveler on a VERY tight budget, it's super frustrating that the MINIMUM price filter is set at $25. I know that this causes me to miss rooms which are available for much less. And again, because I'm on a very tight budget, this makes the app virtually useless to me, which is a bummer because I'm a seasoned airbnb user and I love it in every other way.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-02 4
It really gave me some great, fun new options.
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-01 5
Very helpful
Version 1.2.3 2011-11-01 5
Easy to use with robust functionality. Great mobile component to a great offering.
Version 1.2.3 2011-10-30 5
Very handy. Just wish I could post guest reviews from the site instead of having to open a web browser.
Version 1.2.3 2011-10-30 5
Every part of this app is as well thought out as the service it provides.
Version 1.2.3 2011-10-29 5
Very good
Version 1.2.3 2011-10-28 4
This app could use a few enhancements...like seeing your inbox the same way you see it on the computer. It's a great site/business and such a breath of fresh air if you enjoy traveling!
Version 1.2.3 2011-10-28 5
Such better options than hotels, I'm so glad to have found this
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-27 5
Airbnb is the greatest invention since...
Version 1.1.2 2011-10-27 5
This app is the ultimate dream book, and work desk vacation.

I'm really surprised that it's small-screen only. Hopefully somebody is already working on the tablet version of this stunning resource.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-26 4
I was recently been introduced to this service and I love it!
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-26 5
... And having the app on my phone helps me manage a busy booking schedule with guests via my iPhone around a busy work and social life. We have used it even while overseas to book last minute places to stay when our hotel sucked, and it was a lifesaver!!!
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-24 5
All the functionality you need. Intuitive. Just right
Version 1.1.2 2011-10-24 4
Nice app
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-23 5
Love it!
Version 1.2.1 2011-10-22 5
Heard about it at a restaurant from a friend of the developer and figured what the heck.  Easy enuf to set up, any foibles were my lack of attention.  Have had several guests to our unique guest quarters and each has been so easy it seems to good to be true but it is! The company continues to improve with our satisfaction as an obvious goal.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-21 3
Its a great app but I need to be able to 'edit'.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-21 5
Amazing app works great all the time and is a brilliant idea. Love it.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-21 5
Very cool
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-20 5
It'll change the way we travel
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-20 2
Just booked my first stay, and in order to do so I needed to 'flush out my profile' for the owner of the rental.  For curiosity's sake, I clicked on the 'what my property worth?'. And then Airbnb auto listed me off of my address needed for the rental transaction.  Now I can't remove the listing, and am caught in the limbo of customer support, where they state it will take 'some time' to get back to me.  It took a day to get it de-listed, and the email said that they would consider making changes to the app so it won't autolist your property as a rental.  Changed my rating slightly, but it is still sneaky.
Version 1.2.1 2011-10-20 4
I downloaded this app thinking it would remain useless in my iPhone but found it to be a great resource for last minute lodging.  I found myself stranded in a small town with no vacancies in the hotels.  One tap on my Airbnb app and I found a home to stay in.  It was great!
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-19 5
Used Airbnb for the first time to book 3 B&Bs for our trip to England and Scotland. The Airbnb properties turned out to be the best accommodations on our trip. Using the iPhone Airbnb app was easy, making the task of locating places to stay exceedingly simple. Communicating with the hosts was also  simple and convenient. Next trip, it's Airbnb all the way...
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-19 5
Kudos to the designers and app developers behind this one.  Super easy to set up my account and start browsing, all from my phone.  Excellent translation of the web version that nails all the key features.  Love it!
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-18 5
I love AirBNB, I prefer the website to the app. It's great too
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-18 5
It is amazingly easy to host. Reservations and billing are smooth. Thanks!
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-18 5
Well done app and great idea
Version 1.1.2 2011-10-17 5
Airbnb has changed my life. I absolutely adore it from the people who work there, the people who stay at my home and the hosts I meet when I travel! I use the app constantly and I love it! Helps me respond easier to people when I'm on my phone.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-16 5
With all the text messages. It's so convenient to know who is messages so I can reply much more quickly.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-15 3
We are heavy airbnb users and the app works great, but i want an iPad designed version.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-14 4
Easy to use! Excellent!
Version 1.1.2 2011-10-13 4
Love it! Maybe should allow us to see our search ranking, stand by list...
Otherwise great!
Version 1.2.1 2011-10-12 5
Itz da bestest!
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-11 5
I haven't used a home stay yet, but am currently looking at booking one and couldn't be more excited about the possibilities!
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-11 4
Love the airbnb App. It allows me to keep up with my property while on the go. It keeps my response rate at 100% because I'm only a fingertip away from being connected at all times. Love it! Love it! Love it! My only wish is that it had the same functionality as the website.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-10 5
Super wonderful app! Get it if you use Airbnb on the go!!!!
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-10 4
Love love love! Currently hosting and am looking forward to traveling to a unique airbnb location soon.
Version 1.2 2011-10-08 5
What a great website and now the app?!!! Love love works great
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-08 4
Great for my last trip both as host n traveller. App editing I. E. Dashboard features wld be helpful. Easy income account review wld be cooktop. Overall love everything about airbnb
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-08 5
I love this site! And the app is ok too :)
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-06 5
If you love Airbnb, you'll love the app even more. There are a couple host functions not available on the app compared to the website. Overall a great tool for both host and traveler.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-03 5
The app is awesome. However, as a host I would like to see more of the dashboard integrated into the app. But other than that it's wonderful.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-02 4
The AirBnB app keeps me connected with requests and reservations while I'm traveling. I wish it had the same functionality as the website, but it is very helpful, user friendly and convenient.
Version 1.2.2 2011-10-02 5
So well done.  All iOS apps should be this comprehensive. Excellent work.  Extremely easy to search and communicate with property owners.
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-29 5
A fantastic service.

Love the concept, love the ease of use, thank you so much for making my travels more convenient.
Version 1.2.2 2011-09-21 5
Will never book a hotel room if a room is available on AIRBNB
Version 1.2.2 2011-09-20 5
I love sharing my home with the travelers using Airbnb! They are lovely people:)
Version 1.2.2 2011-09-19 5
This is a better way to rent a room then craigslist much more safe.
Version 1.2.2 2011-09-17 5
So I was sceptic, but I tried it out! I did put a lock on the closet but other than that I opened my home to a total stranger... and it was better than the subletting I have done off craigslist. Not necessarily better people but a shorter time. It's expensive to live in San Francisco, even more so because of the life I choose to live. Airbnb is a sheppard not only for me but travelers like me who are always moving. I agree if it's your once a year vacation maybe the risk is to high.... But I do believe there is a separate god for travelers so hit the road and come visit!! - m2
Version 1.2.2 2011-09-15 5
I like the web interface more but the app is cool too, especially since the latest updates.
Version 1.2.2 2011-09-15 5
Get it now!
Version 1.2.2 2011-09-15 5
Love the service concept, haven't rented anywhere yet though. The app is beautiful
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-14 5
Both the service and the app are topnotch. Facilitates an equitable exchange between host and guest without hassle or exorbitant fees.
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-14 5
I am excited and amazed by AirBnB's ease of access and available info. I had no idea there were so many private rentals in my area. This is my new (first stop) place to go if I'm looking for an amazing space for a short term vacation.. Totally impressed. Thank you, AIRBnB!
Version 1.2.2 2011-09-14 5
Having only used this app a few times I'm already convinced it is the way to travel. Great deals and real friendly people abound!
Version 1.2.2 2011-09-14 5
Just blown away at how easy it is to use this service and all of my bookings thus far have been very positive ...guests have been very thoughtful . Love Airbnb!
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-13 5
Great app!
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-13 5
great idea for those heading out of town or in a relationship with two apartments. :)
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-13 4
Seems to be a good lil app. Works smoothly for me, but I need an Ipad app too!!!! Thanks
Version 1.1.2 2011-09-12 5
Not only is this app great, easy to use and really convenient for travellers, but the whole concept of airbnb is just fantastic. 

I use the app to manage an apartment i'm renting out and this app really comes in handy to communicate with guests immediately and accept and manage reservations. 

I've yet to use airbnb as a guest myself, but with features like the "help, i need a place to stay tonight" button, which finds available places around you immediately (i live in a remote town in Iceland where i tried it and got two hits!) i think that this service, along with the app, are absolutely essential for travellers, as well as hosts.

I might also add that the customer service is fantastic too. I think they might employ superheroes...
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-12 5
Very well made app.
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-10 5
Wonderfully intuitive.
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-10 5
Love the app, easy to navigate!
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-08 5
Very intuitive. Great user experience. Just loving it.
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-08 5
Was going to pay $180+ for a crappy 2-star hotel in Paris. I used airbnb instead and now I'm staying in a slick 1 bedroom apartment for $130 next to Arc Du Triumph (sp?)

Use this app. Use this service.
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-08 5
As we're traveling through Italy, this amazing app is saving us! This app couldn't get any better!! Thx airbnb!
Version 1.2.1 2011-09-08 5
Very helpful for hosts on the go to reply to potential guests promptly!
Version 1.2 2011-08-13 1
After the first time you load it, the app stops being able to start on my iPhone 3G. Please fix this!
Version 1.2 2011-08-12 3
the app design is nice but i found two major usability issues in 5 minutes: unable to set maximum price under 75 USD and unable to filter by wifi availability.
Version 1.1.2 2011-08-11 5
Love airbnb great app and site for travelers.
Version 1.1.2 2011-08-10 5
As an AirBnB host this app is in invaluable!!! We're so busy hosting that we haven't gotten to use it to travel ourselves. But I day dream about traveling while perusing the featured properties while showing of the app to nearly everyone I meet or see who hasn't already heard of AirBnB! You'll be hooked once you try traveling or hosting through AirBnB!
Version 1.2 2011-08-09 2
I am unable to load this app on my iPhone 3G. It shuts down everytime I open this app. Seems to work perfectly fine on iPhone 4.
Version 1.1.1 2011-08-09 5
The app sends the perfect level of reminders and helps you manage a property or room for rent with ease from anywhere your phone works.  The service in general is a pretty brilliant way to travel, I can't wait for my next airbnb vacation.
Version 1.2 2011-08-08 3
Please don't stop my music when I launch it!
Great app btw
Version 1.2 2011-08-07 2
This app runs fine--although you cannot modify your profile from the app so you will have to log into a computer at some point before booking--but after trying twice to get a room with this service i gave up. People don't reply! I wasted a lot of time with this. Not recommended.
Version 1.1.2 2011-08-05 5
This app has made my travel life so much easier!!! LOVE it!!!

Great site and great app!
Version 1.2 2011-08-03 4
Used air bnb for the first time. Booked room and everything was awesome! Saved a bundle over staying at a hotel!
Version 1.2 2011-08-03 5
Love the service!  It's a fun and affordable way to travel!
Version 1.2 2011-08-03 5
Airbnb applied the same user friendliness for the design of this app as on their website. Good job!
Version 1.2 2011-08-02 5
I'm very impressed with Airbnb- even if I was only considering it for a money-saving travel-lodging finder.. It has some unbelievable prices for amazing properties all over the world. Truly caters to travelers of any size budget and has beautiful photos and some well-done videos showcasing various properties. Must say I'm very impressed, especially for a FREE app! Thanks for the great work you've obviously put into making the app so visually and monetarily appealing!
Version 1.2 2011-08-02 4
Recently discovered this app after looking to quickly book a stay in NY. After making several inquires, I heard back immediately from one person via a push notification and was instantly sending messages back and forth to book my stay. It was so easy! 

My only complaint would be that it does crash when jumping between different windows in the app, but is easy to open back up as it remembers your login info. I would also like to see a way to delete your messages or inquiries within the mobile app. Once I've booked a place to stay its annoying to receive notifications from other contacts who think you're still looking for a room. Please fix. Thanks.
Version 1.2 2011-08-01 5
I never leave reviews but had to on this one... Incredible app, great opportunities out there for travel I would have never known about otherwise... I might go on vacation, choosing the destination first via this app.
Version 1.2 2011-07-31 5
Functional and beautiful
Version 1.2 2011-07-30 5
I use it everyday!
Version 1.2 2011-07-30 5
Gosh I ve just found a new dimension of travelling and getting known cities and social networking by using Airbnb..its fantastic and the iPhone application is very user friendly. Well done!
Version 1.2 2011-07-30 1
Constantly crashes i can barely look anything up

The app-excellent, the website-sooooo jealous I didn't think of it...it's great;)
Version 1.2 2011-07-29 5
I put this app on my iPhone and iPad. It's a beautiful app, easy to use, very functional. So glad we found it!
Version 1.2 2011-07-29 5
Excellent app!

This app is the best!  I get lost looking at all of the beautiful listings!  I know where I'm booking my next room in NYC!
Version 1.2 2011-07-24 5
I love this app!!!!!
Version 1.2 2011-07-24 5
Awesome, 5 stars app. I found what i'm looking for here.
Version 1.2 2011-07-23 5
I found my honeymoon spot from here!
Version 1.2 2011-07-23 4
Great app. I'll rate it five stars when it's optimized for the iPad.
Version 1.2 2011-07-23 5
This is one of the best designed apps I have. I don't use it very often, but when I do it's a pleasure. Would love to have it on my iPad!
Version 1.2 2011-07-23 5
I love how easy it is to use and be able to information with others on the spot.  

One improvement I would like to see have done.  Is to make my scheduling calendar available on this app.  So I can update my calendar for guests.

Thanks
Gilbert
Version 1.1.0 2011-07-23 4
Awesome concept. So glad there's an AirBnB app now. Search by map, by dates, privacy & price. Can't search by amenities yet. I'd give it 5 stars except it crashes quite a bit.
Version 1.2 2011-07-22 4
Ipad version??
Version 1.2 2011-07-22 4
Much better than the website...
Version 1.2 2011-07-22 5

This app is amazing!!!!!!!!!! Makes it so simple to find a nice place to stay anywhere in the world!! Genius
Version 1.2 2011-07-21 5
I never review apps, but this one is sleek and sexy I just had to take a minute to recommend it to fractures everywhere! Functional and super easy, this app takes the strain out of last minute BUDGET travel! LOVE IT!

My wife and I found this great vacation home in San Francisco, we closed the deal through the app, and.. HERE WE COME SAM FRANCISCO.!!!!! :-)

Great company, great app- could use a few
More features but love
Love

Version 1.2 2011-07-19 5
Great app, great site, amazing all around!
Version 1.2 2011-07-18 4
Very easy to navigate with an attractive design. A pleasure to use.
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-18 4
Love the app, makes it easy to look at and dream about properties across the world as well as use for the reservations I've made for a weekend getaway. Great to use!
Version 1.2 2011-07-18 5
Easy to use and fun to explore cheap ways of staying in great cities!
Version 1.1.1 2011-07-17 1
Seriously, I cannot even use it. I've reset and restarted my phone. Nothing. It just tries to load and crashes, again and again. Worthless.
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-17 5
Superb design and great functionality.
Version 1.2 2011-07-17 5
But add save scroll position
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-16 4
4 out of 5 stars because I cannot see my account balance or compare myself to the competition from my phone.
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-04 5
Airbnb is one of the best companies I know of. I use their service regularly to travel and host two listings. In many respects, this app is the flagship of their operation as it offers everything you need to book, list and manage listings in real time. They make very effective use of the push server. I highly recommend Airbnb as a service, particularly in conjunction with this app.
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-04 5
This is the best designed, most stable and reliable app available. The airbnb service is obviously amazing in its own right, but since this is an app review, I won't get into that. Hands down, every app designer could learn something from this app.
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-04 5
This app is great. It's going to make travel on the fly and more so, adventure travel easy. I love staying in guest houses vs hotels when possible and this app is the place to find them. From high-end to low, it has them all.
Version 1.1.1 2011-07-04 5
So easy and quick to use... Trimmed down version of the site
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-03 4
Thank you making it all so easy. I really like it!
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-02 5
I just love how the entire business model works together.
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-01 5
We use airbnb to rent rooms when we travel and we also rent out our guest room to travelers. This app lets us stay on top of our reservations, check our messages and search for rooms!

I cant imagine how it could be better. I highly recommend it to any airbnb user!
Version 1.1.2 2011-07-01 5
Very useful if you use airbnb.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-30 4
What matters is having real alternatives to $100/night lodging, despite knowing the whole wing is vacant at your hotels.
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-30 5
I loved it!
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-29 4
I love this app.  

However, if the programmers are reading this, please work on improving the app. 

There should be a way to clear the main screen when your done with games, maybe a vault.

There should be a game rules page.

There should be a way to cancel a game you didn't mean to start.

Thanks
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-28 5
Amazing.
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-28 3
Great service, but the app crashes frequently on my iPhone 4. Also had to uninstall and reinstall the app after I couldn't log into my account.
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-27 5
I rented out my apartment in no time. Thumbs up!
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-25 5
Very easy to use. Love it!
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-24 4
Well done. I would like to be able to search the map with activities/interests features (Fishing, festivals, music production rooms, wood working rooms, etc). 5 stars for that feature.
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-23 5
It's so much easier than getting a hotel plus u get to meet new faces !!! :)
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-22 5
Love the app! Love the idea! Love the process!
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-21 5
used this app for a trip to Barcelona!  Found a fantastic flat in a brilliant location (safe, quiet, but near EVERYTHING).  Inquired and booked all through the app!  very smooth transaction and experience..all the way through!  I highly recommend both app and service!  i may never book a hotel again! :-)
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-21 5
Love it!  Was perfect for our trip to the Bay.  Will use it again and again!
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-20 4
Just joined but I already love it! Great destinations. Excellent website & resource for travel. The guys that created this are geniuses!
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-18 5
If you love to travel but hate being a tourist air bnb is the way to go.  You get to experience cities in a much more intimate way when you're in an actual residence instead of some hotel. And, the beautiful bonus is that it's astonishingly less expensive than even a mediocre motel.
Version 1.1.2 2011-06-17 5
Saved me so much money on my vacation, and turned out to be a much better experience than if I had stayed in a hotel. Now I'm just waiting for an iPad app.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-17 5
A fantastic app for a phenomenal service.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-17 5
Great app, glad I ran into this one.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-16 5
What an amazing find!
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-15 5
For trying to independently rent out a room or find a room!
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-15 2
Try searching for a new town or changing the filter.  Be prepared to wait 20+ seconds with no feedback.  Scrolling in the search list is jumpy too.
Version 1.1.0 2011-06-14 5
Planning an impromptu vacation this year has been great fun & very easy with this app!!
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-12 5
Haven't used it yet, but I can't wait! As someone who loves home hospitality, and HATES cheap hotels, I love this idea! Especially like the "need a place to stay tonight" option.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-12 5
Fun little app! :)
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-11 4
Great app overall. I especially appreciate how easily it saves specific searches. One major improvement would be if you could save apartments that you're interested in and/or omit those you don't care for.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-11 5
Very well done and easy to use.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-11 5
Just relocated to a new city...I will use Airbnb until I find a permanent place
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-09 5
I feel how I look,,,,,,,,,, I feel good!!!!!!!!!!
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-09 5
Enjoy using the app. It has all the features of the full website. Was able to easily book a place from my phone. Thanks!!
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-08 5
Well thought of, as good as the main site !
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-07 5
Love this site and the app is just as good! Highly suggest to anyone who is traveling. have had a great experience with all the places we've stayed so far! The app is easy to use and awesome when traveling because you can easily contact the hosts and find places quickly. So much fun to just browse as well. if you need a place to stay this is the site to find it!
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-07 5
Great simplified version of the standard website. Easy to navigate, easy to use. Thanks. :)

Easy, efficient, elegant!
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-03 4
This is what I have been looking for a long time when I travel. Thank you for developing such an awesome product.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-02 5
easy to use and well-designed app that allows easy access to all the functionality of airbnb. good integration with maps and phone.

the only real downside is that there is no way to permanently save your login information, and you are prompted for it to access any part of the app, including things like searching, which should be available even when logged out.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-01 5
Thx for the FREE "Hollywood Photoshoot"! It brought out the natural beauty of my home.
Version 1.1.1 2011-06-01 5
This app is a must for the frequent traveler. If your looking to feel like a native this is it.
Version 1.1.1 2011-05-31 5
A must app if you travel
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-12 4
I have had a great experience with thia app so far.  It has actually never crashed for me and been helpful when the university PC's are taken or just running very slowly.  Maybe the way they have developed the application that makes it so solid.  I really like the graphics as it makes travel booking quite fun.  Looking forward to more features in future releases.
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-10 5
As a host I use it repeatedly daily and no crashes to date. I love the format, the ease, the graphics so clear.
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-08 4
I wish they have more property available. I <3 travel.
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-07 5
No crashes so far. Seems very well polished. Easy to search for places to stay for my next vacation. Very straightforward to look for places in the area, see pictures, contact the owner, and book the place.
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-05 4
I have read some other reviews about the app crashing, unfortunately, I can not confirm the instability of the app itself. It has been doing exactly what was advertised, which is always nice here in the app store. 

I was very surprised to find such quality listings internationally, which is where I hope to spend more time. 

Quick and easy to understand interface with some extras I would not have thought about, but were a def plus to the overall experience. 

Give it a try! You have nothing to lose, it's FREE! Who knows, you may just find some place, somewhere you have always wanted to go with insider's POV. (and that's what traveling is all about, IMHO)
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-05 5
:-)
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-05 1
We are traveling in Spain and I was looking to using this app while traveling. It crashes every time.  I tried deleting and re-installing, but still doesn't work. It worked before we left. I hope there is a fix soon.
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-03 1
As a host on airbnb I was really excited that there was a update.  I had hoped that the bugs were going to be worked out bacasue the last version crashed every time I tried to open it.  Well, guess what?  It still crashes.  I've tried uninstalling the app and reloading it several times and still have no luck.  This is really disappointing because my income depends on being able to get back to prospective guests very quickly.  I've given up on this app.  It's easier to use Safari.
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-01 2
It won't even open; I enjoy that actual website though.
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-01 5
Airbnb has built an amazing app that seamlessly recreates the web experience. While on vacation I can book a place to stay, and rent my own all without ever carrying a laptop, genius.
Version 1.1.1 2011-04-01 4
I haven't had a chance to use the app to book a stay somewhere, but it looks fantastic, and it's a great idea implemented. 

The only thing I thought was missing was a favorite's section. I see so many great places, but I'm not able to tag them to easily review them at a later date. If that was rectified, I'd easily give it 5 stars then.
Version 1.1.1 2011-03-31 1
I am a host on Airbnb and need this app to respond to guests but the app won't even open without crashing.
Version 1.1.1 2011-03-31 5
Browsing the app just like traveling around the world@@
Version 1.1.1 2011-03-30 5
And love airbnb

Great App, Great UI and excelent content. 
Easy to use App for lodging
Version 1.1.1 2011-03-28 5
I had no idea anything like this even existed. What a wonderfully easy app and overall idea!
Version 1.1.1 2011-03-27 5
The images and functionality are amazing! I can confirm guests from anywhere. I can also browse pictures at the airport waiting for flights :)
Version 1.1.1 2011-03-27 5
Beautiful
Version 1.1.1 2011-03-26 2
I only like looking at all the cool places that's the only reason I got it
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-26 5
This app is absolutely gorgeous. I can't believe how easy Airbnb has made booking an island! You can do it in one simple tap of a button from you iPhone! That's mind blowing. 

I'm looking forward to booking a trip with this app soon.
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-26 5
This app is absolutely fantastic. Very handy if you travel a lot. Thank you guys!
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-23 5
A very well done app that has saved me during my travels!
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-21 2
Useful but reliable enough if you are a host with Airbnb !
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-21 5
One of the most useful tools for traveling
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-20 1
I've redownloaded this app more than enough time and it keeps crashing. It wont even open the home page. It worked for a bit the first time and it was great. But now, it won't open at all.
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-19 5
Sometimes I look at the app just to dream about future trips, even while on vacation! Such an incredibly, well-made service and beautifully helpful app. I love airbnb!
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-19 5
Great app, well designed. Images are beautiful, how can you not want to travel when you see this stuff?!?!! Nice job!

Hotels.com + Facebook + AwesomeSauce
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-13 5
A wonderful tool for us!! We use Airbnb to help us occupy our 20 properties in the Chicago area.  We offer short term corporate housing so our clients are generally never with us much longer then a month.  This app helps us tremendously with keeping track of our clientele, arrivals, departures, contact info and much more.  

This is much more than an app. It's an upstanding company to do business with!!

Kudos!!!
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-09 5
My wife and I used this to travel up the California coast on our honeymoon. We stayed in two cities and one art community right outside a city. One of the stops was even on the fly and all of our housing accommodations exceeded expectation.  Thanks bnb!
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-07 3
The app itself seems to work well with no real issues. My concern is that using the app and the prices not being what's advertised. Ok with some mark up for hosting, but some (most in my case) sites were twice or more than shown on site. Ended up using priceline at last minute to secure a hotel. Over all concept is great, just need to have no bait and switch.

Update:
Finally used it and the location / accommodation were great!  Will be using again.
Version 1.1.0 2011-03-04 3
Likely a fishing scheme to get personal data on users.   I entered a zipcode in response to the prompt "see what your place is worth".    Soon I got email urging me to complete my "listing".    Then learned my "listing" expires after 24 hours unless I post a photo.   Deceptive practice at worst, lousy design at best.
Version 1.1.0 2011-02-26 3
Great for searching properties. Difficult to manage your own. Hard to find your bookings, etx. Is there even access to the calendar?
Version 1.1.0 2011-02-26 5
I've used AirBnB for traveling all over the world and love it. Their app is very useful, however I do wish they would show favorites (currently I can only see them on website).
Version 1.1.0 2011-02-26 5
App designers, take note - this is exemplary UX.
Version 1.1.0 2011-02-24 5
Love it love it love it. Fresh, clean, intuitive. Kudos to Airbnb's mobile application development. Their website is also incredible. As a software engineer and working in hospitality this is the best project I've ever seen in this industry.
Version 1.1.0 2011-02-23 5
I have never fallen so hard or so fast for an app the way I have for airbnb! It's beautiful, well organized, easy to use, helpful in a pinch or for a planner...it's perfect - just like the idea and company itself :o)
Version 1.1.0 2011-02-19 4
There is a problem with auto login. Always prompts me to login with my credentials, doesn't save them on device.

Stylish, informative, and fun to browse
Version 1.1.0 2011-02-11 5
I love airbnb app as well as the website. I have used airbnb to book getaways 3 times and the next trip is scheduled for April. Airbnb app is on of the best, design and interface are great! Sometimes I just used it cheer myself up or search for a new design ideas for my home.

good interface n very user friendly.
Version 1.1.0 2011-02-06 5
Airbnb.com is a great service.  I've used it to stay in Paris and Austin, with great results.  Now, they've put this app out, and unbelievably, it works more smoothly than their own website.

I'm planning my next trip to Europe entirely from my iPhone.  Pretty amazed!

Have fun!
Version 1.1.0 2011-01-09 5
We are always looking for new, interesting places to go and this app/ service does just that.
Version 1.1.0 2011-01-08 4
I'm impressed with the quality and all functionality of this app. The service is already awesome, so the app brings all you need to your pocket. 
The only issue is that I'm experiencing some bugs and crashes when checking search results.
Version 1.1.0 2011-01-06 5
I just learned about airbnb.  I hope everyone hears about it soon.
This is how I travel, and its the only way to go..
I listed my place, come visit!
Version 1.1.0 2011-01-06 5
This is one of the few apps that made me step back and say "wow".
Disabling text notifications when push is enabled? They didn't have to do that, but the fact that they did shows an attention to detail and user experience that sets it apart from many services and applications out there.
Version 1.1.0 2011-01-06 4
I love travel very much, I think it is best app for travel.
Version 1.1.0 2011-01-04 5
This app kept me a virgin.

This site is amazing! I don't know if I'd ever hotel again..
Version 1.0.2 2010-12-27 1
I love airbnb but this app is useless. I can no longer even open it without it immediately crashing
Version 1.0.2 2010-12-21 1
I'm a big fan of the AirBnB service but this app is unusable.  I've reloaded it a dozen times and it won't work at all.
Version 1.1.0 2010-12-17 3
I love this app but please fix all the crashing! The only thing I can do is log on and see the Featured page then it crashes every time.
Version 1.0.2 2010-12-11 5
I'm a fellow iOS developer, working with large clients.  This app is designed very well. Probably one of the best example on how a data-driven, B2B2C app should be built.  

I recommend this as both a developer and a user.  Thanks for the inspiration and great service.
Version 1.0.1 2010-12-08 5
Good place to reserve rooms.
Version 1.0.1 2010-12-02 5
I think everyone that loves to travel download this app. It's awesome and I barely downloaded it. Can't wait to actually stay places that I book.

For one who seldom ventures from NYC, make that ventures beyond 40th & Lex, I must say I find this application quite enjoyable indeed.

Just needs some fixes. Cannot search many specific locations but results show differently for "Current location" compared to city searches. Cannot adjust distance for nearby search results. Needs more filters such as amenities or type of rental.

I really enjoy using this app to book for places. The only thing I recommended is that it should added places in the filter section. :) But overall awesome app!!!

Have used Airbnb all throughout Europe and prefer it to hotels hands down. This app has been thoughtfully created and is a must have for globetrotters.

I've used this on my last trip from the PC version.The site works and is great. I'm so happy this is now an app and it looks better then ever and easy to use.
