Great! Very efficient!

Kayak is simply the best way to search for all your vacation needs. All the airlines, except Southwest, are searched and organized however you'd like. Simply a great company and app.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-19 1
Worst app ever....
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-19 5
I highly recommend. Their prices are usually always the cheapest! ;)
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-19 5
I'm going to use it from now and on !!!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-18 5
Great app
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-18 5
I'm a frequent traveler but on a budget. I love the kayak app. My favorite feature is the push notifications I can set up to alert me of price changes. I also like being able to see flight cost analysis and best dates to fly data available in the app. Everyone I know comes to me to get flight purchasing advice and I always show them my kayak app. Super easy to use and modify searches, etc.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-18 5
One of the more reliable apps out there.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-18 5
I've done one search and the app has worked like a charm!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-17 1
"No" isn't an acceptable button label in that dialog: button labels should be verbs.

5 stars upon removing review-begging.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-17 5
Really easy app to use to compare different hotels ! Awesome.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-16 5
Our family travels often and this app provides us with the information we need!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-16 5
Very useful and good tips.
Version 26.0.4 2014-03-16 5
They show you prices from other major flight search engines so you can quickly compare. The flexible date and airport tools are great and lastly I just discovered their price alerts section which helps you find the best way to get to major areas like Europe, etc. Overall a fantastic app, check it out.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-16 4
Wonderful tool to play around with to plan a vacation. Would highly suggest more filters though for flights and hotels ex: flights leaving after 12 pm, etc.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-15 1
And what if I travel with children or an infant that flies for way less? Useless for us!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-15 5
Perfect app and easy to use
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-15 5
I use this app every time I plan a trip.

It's just as easy as going online.. ;) love this app!!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-12 3
I like kayak for flights and car rentals but the hotel feature does not allow for pet friendly search therefore making it rather useless for those of us who travel with our fur babies
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-12 5
Best overall app for finding what's available.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-11 5

This app allows you compare price on various airline and various airports. Also you can set up fate watchers. I always check Kayak before I book airline tickets.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-10 5
Everything I was looking for: price tracking, flight tracker, hotels, and car rental. Streamlined and great user interface.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-10 5
Easy as 123
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-09 5
I've booked two weekend getaways through Kayak and I love the app because it does all the price comparisons for you. 

Quick & efficient. Highly recommended for all your future getaways.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-09 4
I use this app a lot to find & book my flights. Easy to use and returns lots and lots of flight options 

The one thing I noticed that is missing now that I used a lot in previous versions is the History tab to easily search for routes/dates I searched before. Please bring this back!!!!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-09 5
Easy to find flights quickly. Great for last minute travel

I like to use it on my iPhone and iPad. Very easy to use!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-08 5
It keeps crashing after 10 minutes of using the app!
Version 26.0.4 2014-03-07 5
Ridiculously easy to use, and love the fact that they search multiple sites for deals. 

Also, I haven't upgraded to iOS 7, so Kayak provided the option to download the last compatible version for iOS 6. Most apps don't give you that option. Yet another reason to love it. Thanks Kayak!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-07 5
Wow, after planning many trips on my own I finally caved and tried outKkayak. It was amazing! I definitely highly recommend it to anyone!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-07 1
I enter my flight info and it just doesn't read it. It says "please enter at least one leg of your trip".  No solution. Needs update.
Version 24.0.1 2014-03-06 5
Very useful.
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-05 4
Hope they add the +/-3 days option similar to the website. Other than that - great!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-05 5
A must have for traveling bottom line. Convenient and usefully from every step planning the trip to flights and booking hotels. Great deals on every page. Thanks
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-05 4
The application works well on OW and RT flights, although it lacks many airlines, especially budget. On multiple stops it can get tricky and you are better off researching on your own
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-04 5
Luv it!!
Version 29.0.0 2014-03-04 4
This app finds the rates quicker than other apps. I really enjoy this app, I would recommend it to others.

The ui is very easy to use.
Version 29.0.0 2014-02-13 1
This app is glitchy, slow and faulty
Version 29.0.0 2014-02-13 2
Great for a short stay.  Are my stay in waffles and muffins.  Not fancy but clean.  Will probably use again.
Version 29.0.0 2014-02-11 5
I'm constantly checking Kayak for low price flights and flexible scheduling. I also like to see if the price of my flight went down to get refund credit.
Version 29.0.0 2014-02-11 5
What a great idea, so helpful for traveling far away.

I love the options
Version 29.0.0 2014-02-07 4
This version is refreshing to use. Finding a flight is a very fluid and eye popping experience. The only con I can see is the lack of choice for selecting the second leg of flights with multiple stops. All in all, this great for mobile.

Very easy to view, navigate, and book. Can't wait to use it when we travel!
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-14 5
Best app for frequent travelers and hopeful travelers. Can set up alerts for price drops, can make trips flexible to get the best prices. I find this app very useful and efficient so I don't have to search the internet on multiple sites. This does that for you.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-14 5

-no 3 day before/3 day after search function like Orbitz.
-no way to tell if flights are non stop.
-no advanced search feature.
-no calendar view like ITA Matrix.

Pretty easy to use and navigate. Just wish that kayak posted the dates of departures/arrivals on itineraries that have multiple overnight flights or cross multiple time zones.

Works perfectly on an iPhone 5s with iOS 7.0.4. Shows all flight times, layovers, and it's easy to find the cheapest price for your airfare. Before checkout it shows pricing on other travel sites. I fully recommend this.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-05 5
This app keeps getting better for my purposes. It makes my travel more convenient and efficient.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-05 2
When you choose the round trip option it makes it confusing and discombobulating to book a trip, it only gives you the one way option instead of the complete round trip view like on the website... I use kayak constantly on my computer but find it impossibly aggravating to use on my iPhone.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-05 4
It's really awesome
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-05 4
I enjoy this app. A good way to get an idea what to except when planing a trip.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-05 5
I loved the clever names for distance under the filters for hotels. "A stone's throw"=.1 mile "hop, skip & jump"=.2 mile  "easy walk"=1 mile "short drive"=6 miles "pretty far"=10 miles and "infinity"=any distance

A witty app is a good app.
Version 27.0.1 2014-01-05 1
And it isn't the user of this app. Deleted.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-04 5
I think this is a very efficient app, just because it shows you all the prices and you are guaranteed that you will not find them at lower prices.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-04 3
Easy to use. Frequently the lowest price posted is erroneous. When you click through to actually book a car or hotel the price can be significantly higher.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-04 5
I'm in the military and don't have time to sit and spend hours looking this is great it gives me everything I need

Version 29.0.0 2014-01-02 4
This is the app I go to first for checking out hotels airfares cars etc. One thing I would love to see in the application is the ability to save hotels that I may be interested in without actually booking. Please add that function.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-02 5
I love Using this app to find cheap tickets.
Version 29.0.0 2014-01-01 5
This app is great for tracking your travel plans and saving your trip information. I love the trip agenda view.

Kayak is a good app. I get to check a multitude of hotels at once.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-29 1
It keeps on returning search results for airports that I did not use one the search...
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-28 5

Version 26.0.4 2013-12-28 1
I started looking for flights using the Kayak for iPad app which then directs me to book a fare on kayak.com or Orbitz. I couldn't purchase the fare Kayak found me on Orbitz.com inside the Kayak iPad app, I was sent in an endless loop after entering my credit card info 5 times. I finally went to Kayak.com, to my amazement, I found even lower fares using the exact same search criteria. These were "Hacker" fares that Kayak.com shows but Kayak for iPad does not show! Both your web site and your iPad app sent me to someone else's web site to actually book and purchase tickets, what gives? Gone are the days of calling a travel agent to book your flights, we've all been booking our own flights online or in a mobile app for years now, why is Kayak and Kayak.com SO COMPLICATED and the fares inconsistent? Fix it please, so I don't have to delete your iPad app, your Kayak.com web site is soooooooooooooooo slow! I'd rather use the Kayak app, but only if you show ALL fares, I feel cheated!
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-28 5
Works conveniently for researching flights or trips on-the-go.

It is a bit annoying when narrowing in on searches. For example when I narrowed flights by price, travel time, etc., the ball on the meter does not stay put. It fluctuates and thus my search is not as narrowed in! I recommend that kayak updates this with a + and - on either end so the target range is selected properly.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-28 4
Always a go to, works very well.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-27 5
This app made for the easiest hotel booking I have ever done.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-27 5
Best in class with clear layout.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-27 1
Unusable
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-27 5
I can USUALLY find a better deal here than with the actual hotels/airlines. If it's cheaper to go through the direct source, Kayak says so. This is great.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-26 5
Very easy to use
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-26 4
Hasn't let me down. Quick and easy to find flights and compare prices. Wish they had a feature with different prices on different dates of the calendar
Version 26.0.4 2013-12-23 5
Great site
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-22 4
Useful quick app. What you'd expect
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-22 2
Where has the "swap cities" (the function with which you change one city with the other when looking for flights) button gone?
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-22 5
I like the variety of flights and hotels available each time I look something up.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-22 5
Hands down the best app of its kind.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-21 1
I click roundtrip but it will only let me book one way.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-21 4
Love it! Most of the time, supplies me with the cheapest fares.
Version 25.0.1 2013-12-21 2
Very hard to use. Does not check Southwest and does not check multiple days!
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-21 5
I couldn't live without this app
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-20 5
Great incorporation of the new style in the iOS, amazing prices from an array of airlines, and very easy to use. Fast too!
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-20 5
This version is so much better than the previous ones - it might be the best KAYAK version yet.
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-20 5
app works great, just what I need for trip planning and pricing
Version 29.0.0 2013-12-20 2
The pictures in My Trips are nice but now the completed trips are kind lumped together with the current ones.  I like having access to the completed trips but it would be better if they had their own folder or section. The ads are annoying too
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-19 1
Needs more of the features that are available on the full site.
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-18 5
Delivers fast and easy results so you can make an informed decision!

Can't see part of results...total hotel costs, for example, are off screen. Previous version didn't have this issue. This used to be a great app!
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-17 5
I have been using this app for a year now. I have booked several vacations over the year. It's quick and easy. Best part is you have it all in one place. Finding deals is easy.
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-17 5
Love using kayak. It's easy and quick!
Version 26.0.0 2013-12-16 5
Nothing more to say. Kayak has it nailed down.
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-16 2
Kayak as a whole is great, but their app has some bugs that make the experience frustrating. Aside from vague details when looking at hotel rooms the form and booking page cuts off the right-side of the screen, hiding important information. After trying repeatedly to book a room I decided on using another service and app instead.
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-15 5
App is great. It is missing option to select "cheapest day" on multi city flight selection.
Version 26.0.4 2013-12-14 5

Love this app, so easy to use.
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-09 2
I love this app for business travel but with the new upgrade they've hidden the gate information. Kind of important when your running to make a connection. I'm switching to another app. Too bad.
Version 28.0.0 2013-12-09 5
Thanks kayak
Version 27.0.1 2013-11-09 1
Give me gold in tapjoy!
Version 27.0.1 2013-11-05 1
Oh my, if you decide to use Kayak then pray you don't have to calm customer service.  The upside of their customer service is that their English is so bad they don't understand the words one says to express their frustration and the downside is that their English is so bad they can't understand anything you say.
Version 26.0.4 2013-11-04 5
From what I've read I feel blessed to have had no problems with this app. I have been using it a lot the past month and haven't experienced the issues other users have. This app is very intuitive, easy to use and I'd recommend it to anyone.

I have no idea why iOS 7 had such a catastrophic  effect on the previously sensational Kayak app, but the initial changeover nearly wrecked all of its functionality.  Fortunately some recent revisions have made it more stable and easier to read, and restored many of the filters though not all of them (for round trips, I still miss the ability to filter out return flights that land at a different airport than the starting point).  So it's coming back towards its previous usefulness, though it isn't there yet.  One wonders: Did all the old developers leave?
Version 23.0.2 2013-11-02 5
+1
Version 26.0.2 2013-10-29 5
Instead of searching numerous sites to find the best deals, Kayak does it for you. Definitely a must have.
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-29 5
Gutttt
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-27 4
I have been using kayak for years. I travel s lot and the 80% of my booking are made through this app or web site.
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-27 4
Gets the job done.
Version 24.0.0 2013-10-24 5
Great App.
Version 27.0.1 2013-10-22 5
Maybe is my old OS on iphone4s but this app is very useful, it's very easy to get information from it quickly. Great temporary replacement when not I front of a PC or Mac.
Version 27.0.1 2013-10-21 1
This used to be a good app but now it's limited too specific airlines, doesn't search n compare most of the airlines.
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-20 4
Quick search results with good 2 go options
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-20 5
It works great, very good navigation
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-18 1
I find it dismaying that your travel correspondent is not traveling to, or offering video information about, any travel destinations where people of color live. What a terribly missed opportunity to neglect the rich cultures, cuisines and natural beauty of the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean, South America, etc. Very interesting. The Eurocentricity has been noted. This application will be deleted.
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-18 5
Love to travel and Kayak makes it very easy to search hotels
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-16 5
Easy and fast search, better and faster than desktop version of website.
Version 27.0.1 2013-10-15 1
Whatever happened to support. App can't stay open for more than a couple of seconds. Has been this way for way too long. Don't even think about downloading. Total waste of time.
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-15 5
Yes, I am not sure why I see one negative review.
I have a fabulous experience using the app.
Its sensible and fast.
Use it, save time...
Version 26.0.2 2013-10-14 4
So far it has been good.
Version 27.0.1 2013-10-13 1
:-(
Version 26.0.2 2013-10-13 5
this is my favorite app to lookup flights.
I buy on airline web sites but always search kayak first.
Version 27.0.1 2013-10-12 1
This version is only good with iOS7.  Of course, I didn't notice that until AFTER it was already updated in my iTunes App section.  I am not operating on iOS7...so this App is now useless to me...THANKS A LOT!  If you would kindly offer the previous version which works with iOS6 for those of us not yet on iOS7, I would kindly reciprocate with a better review.  Until then, ADIOS KAYAK!!!
Version 26.0.4 2013-10-11 5
Best mobile app for booking flights
Version 27.0.1 2013-10-08 2

Version 27.0.0 2013-09-26 1
I purchased the pro version of Kayak, this app does not work it constantly crashes.  Please fix this app!
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-26 1
Only crashes. It was working fine before this latest update.
Version 23.0.2 2013-09-26 2
App crashes as soon as it is opened in iOS 7.
Version 26.0.4 2013-09-26 1
Crashes immediately ....
Version 26.0.4 2013-09-26 5
Clearly presents your options for flights, hotel, etc and includes taxes in the rates.
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-26 1
Since iOS 7, the app crashes when trying to open the Filters. 

Was awesome, now... Not so much.
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-25 1
I search for round trip flights and I can only see the first leg of flights then it asks me to book the flight before I can see the return part of the flight

Also I cannot modify my search now, from example I can't cancel the 2-stop flights from showing up

Please fix this , otherwise I will sadly delete why was once a great applicatikn
Version 26.0.4 2013-09-25 3

Version 27.0.0 2013-09-25 2
Taping filters causes app to crash
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-25 5
I just deleted and re-downloaded this app in iOS7, and the filters are working again. Thanks Kayak :) this is my favorite search engine, so having full capability back is delightful.
Version 22.0.1 2013-09-25 2
This is one of my 5 star apps. Every time I attempt to apply the filters, it crashes.  Also I hate the fact that the "History Search" option is missing. Please fix and update ASAP.
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-25 2
Great app, but the latest version crashes when you try to use filters. I am reluctantly headed for the Expedia app right now! Why are you making me do this?
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-25 1
I love Kayak but it's useless me to since the last update -- crashes every time I hit the filter icon.
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-25 1
I used to love this app, this new version crashes every time you try to filter your airfare search results. Also I really like the way it saved your searches for airfare so you could quickly run through your list of searches, now that feature is gone. If it doesn't come back I'll be using a different app for my travel searches.
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-24 5
I've used kayak several times to research & purchase flights. I've had great luck every time & it truly is the best pricing at one site. I've compared to every other discount & airline site. Wonderful!
Version 26.0.4 2013-09-24 5
Awesome app. Very convenient.
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-24 2
Having same issue as other reviewers - app crashes in iOS 7 when you try to apply filters. Please fix!
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-24 1
This used to be my go-to app for fare searches, but after the latest update, the app crashes every time I try to apply filter to my search results.
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-24 1
Can't view search by brands anymore! Before you could filter the inpendent hotels and big chains.
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-23 3
Crashing when tapping filters button
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-23 1
Good app overall (until this one). Version. 27.0 has a repeatable bug that is too obvious and important to allow a SW to be released:each time you tap on the filter icon (bottom right) the app closes.
So it renders this app unusable, too bad.
Version 26.0.4 2013-09-23 5
Accurate and lowest prices..
Version 27.0.0 2013-09-23 1
Every time I select a filter, the app crashes. Fix!!!

Version 26.0.2 2013-09-08 4
Handy for searching flights, but I haven't used the 'checkout' feature yet.
Version 26.0.2 2013-09-08 4
Just doesn't include flights for Southwest Airlines.
Version 26.0.2 2013-09-01 5
very useful
Version 26.0.2 2013-09-01 5
Very easy to use. I love how it keeps a record of recent searches. I've only used it to book and track flights so far, and I've heard that fares go up upon repeated visits to some sites. This is completely anonymous until you book so fares are always 'fare'. Very well constructed app. Very fast. Even on slow networks. Kudos you guys.
Version 26.0.2 2013-08-31 5
My favorite app for looking up flight options. Very helpful when stuck in an airport and needing to change plans. Works fast for me.

Version 26.0.2 2013-08-31 4
The app is very good. Unfortunately I couldn't find a way of looking for flights from Europe to Cuba. Which is professionally bad. Come on guys, not everyone is American and flights to Cuba do exist!!!
Version 26.0.2 2013-08-31 4
I am rating in terms of arrival time in my country. I usually gets home around 11 am which is not bad at all. But in tes of food drinks departure time delays is nuts

Version 25.0.1 2013-08-16 5
Awesome!
Version 26.0.2 2013-08-16 2
Not a bad app for checking flight prices, but as I was trying to make a hotel reservation, the price they showed on the search results wasn't the price I got when trying to make a reservation. It was about $60/night more.
Version 26.0.2 2013-08-15 5
Great app
Version 26.0.2 2013-08-15 5
So far Kayak has been the easiest travel app to use. I've easily researched my trip & got a great deal on a hotel. I'll let you know if I have to change my review once I book my trip but so far so good!

Booked hotel accommodations for the first time today via Kayak and the platform is just so user friendly!  I was able to arrange my hotel stay at a 5-star luxury resort in Downtown Palm Springs for less than $90 p/night. Great competitive pricing - BARGAIN, I would say!! :-)

KAYAK is the first place I check for flights and hotels!! Even the website doesn't have Flight Tracker like the app does!!
Version 26.0.0 2013-07-15 5
It's easy to use and makes hotel searching easy. Also does have the lowest prices when I checked the other sites for hotels. LOVE IT AND DON'T CHANGE!!
Version 26.0.0 2013-07-15 5
Includes many useful tools for traveling. Air ticket search may miss several discount airlines.

Version 26.0.0 2013-07-13 4
I've used the Kayak app for several reservations and am quite pleased with it. Window views are not always ideal once you get to the reservation part of the process, but that seems to be an interface issue between Kayak and the many companies they deal with. If those pages were adapted to fit the frame, I would be happier.
Version 26.0.0 2013-07-13 5
Great app!!!!!
Version 26.0.0 2013-07-09 5

This app will give you many good deals and then redirect you to purchase. I try to purchase using the Orbitz option through this app, but you will not be able to because the purchase button is covered by other buttons in the app. This renders the app completely useless.

Best app to compare prices before traveling. Everyone should have this app!!!
Version 25.0.1 2013-06-08 5
This app delivers everything you need for a traveler on the go! I travel a lot and often at the last minute. Rarely do I find cheaper flights or hotels with other websites or apps. I mostly use it internationally and within the South Pacific.
Version 25.0.1 2013-06-08 5
Overall a great app and good last minute deals

!
Version 25.0.1 2013-06-06 3
It's a good app in general but it's missing many filters including type of travelers. It just lets you choose the number but not whether they are kids and if they are in a separate seat or on your lap etc
Version 25.0.1 2013-06-06 5
very good
Version 25.0.1 2013-06-06 5

Kayak is all you need for booking anything for your future trip!  Sometimes cheaper on the app than website!
Version 25.0.1 2013-06-01 5
Never disappointed, always accurate with the most current information. Great to check prices and availability. I recommend it to anybody else who does a lot travel.

Fast and good for use. I like it
Version 25.0.1 2013-06-01 2
The filter functions are clumsy and stupid. The distance slider starts at .03 miles, and then goes to 13 miles - if you can get it to stop there!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-31 5
Love this app. many options to help but still so easy to use!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-31 5

Easy to use. Had it on my previous phone. Seems like there used to be a way to save flights to review later. Miss that. Otherwise it's a great app!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-30 4
Awesome application!!!!!!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-30 5
I use to use it solely for keeping track of my itinerary while on travel, but I have found that it is much much more. I recently booked my flights and my hotel using the app and I am very happy with the features it offers. I am able to lock in flights that I otherwise could not lock in with the airlines 3rd party site. No matter how many times I searched the flight...Kayak did not inflate the cost like other websites do. I will use them again!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-29 5
Very nice app. I use it all the time. Very easy and convenient.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-29 5
Kayak is the best way to travel. I will only go through kayak to book any reservation and traveling.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-29 5
Three little words...One Stop Shop!

Fast/easy
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-29 5
This is better than trip it as I've used that before with many issues. Kayak is streamless and causes me so much less headache as I travel 12 days out of the month on average.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-26 5
Great app, easy to use with great filters! Everything on one place...
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-25 5
The kayak mobile app is extremely easy to use and so helpful! Quick access to hotel information, reviews and more.

Awesome tool for travel bookings
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-25 5
Good prices and deals are only the starting points for the Kayak APP.  What I like the most is its ability to put the entire trip in the calendar including flights, car rentals , hotels etc and alert you thru SMS. Alerts also on flight delays , gate changes etc.  A must have for frequent travelers.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-25 5
One stop shop for planning all travel details. I use it weekly.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-25 5
I like
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-24 5
Simple interface and fast searching. If only the non-major airlines would join Kayak (Frontier, Alaskan, Jetblue and Southwest), life would be complete.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-24 5
nice
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-24 5
I always use Kayak when I book anything.  I have never been disappointed.   Keep up the great work!

Easiest way to plan for a trip!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-22 5
This is definitely the best go-to app for travel. Multiple sorting options and filters allow you to easily choose your priorities.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-21 5

Version 25.0.1 2013-05-19 1
I downloaded this app. Used it to book a hotel room, less than 24hrs later my CC info had been stolen and used to make online purchases. I do not recommend this app! Major security issues!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-19 5
Best website out there for airline tickets. Consistently beats other sites!!!!

It doesn't get much better. Easy to use, quick, all my travel needs in one place.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-19 5
Used kayak to search for years.  Love the app.  Fast and intuitive.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-19 1
I have been searching for flights from Abe to Portland then Bozeman back to Abe. Results come in ok but are never accurate. When I try to book with united the cost is always $100 more per ticket and the flights are never the same. Don't waste your time on this app or this company. UPDATE: kayak is still returning false results for flights- on 5/19 kayak returned a result for Allentown to Portland and Bozeman to Allentown in August for 628 but when going thru to delta to book it timed out then I went to delta web site and the same flight is over $800. Kayak is useless at best and misleading and wasteful at worst. Don't waste your time!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-19 5
Super features
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-19 1
Shows you flights and prices that are great but when you try to book always get a "flights just sold out" on any and ALL of the options you try. VERY DISAPPOINTING.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-19 5
It does what exactly what you need it to do. I've had no problems with it since the download.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-19 5
Use this app all the time to check prices of flights.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-19 5

Version 25.0.1 2013-05-17 5
It's gives many choices
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-17 1
Completely useless!!! Flight prices shown in the alert features are not available or nowhere to find not even on the website of the mentioned air line!!!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-17 4
It is great app and I would recent it for anybody
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-17 4
Loved that I didn't have to go online and search everyday. A travel agent could have done that for me but I like to be in control. Wish the selection to book from app was easier. Had to enter all flight info again on airline website. I went to airline from computer instead. But this app kept me informed. Def must for travelers.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-16 5
Kayak is the most useful travel tool yet created.

Fast and easy but difficult to interpret
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-16 5
Has the most in depth info compared to all the travel search apps. I have all of them and kayak has the best info, although it does not give a "buy" or "do not buy" advice on the mobile version.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-16 4
Nice app

I am SO glad I found this app right before I went on all my business trips this year! Now I can have all my flight & hotel Information at hand & in one place! And the airport directory with maps is great! I won't have to walk around an airport anymore to find the perfect place to eat while I wait to board the next flight! Thank Goodness for Kayak! :) <3
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-11 5
Not much else to say; this is the best travel app out there.

A very well developed app. Easy to use and very helpful in finding hotels, flights and car rentals
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-10 5
Best travel app, but may not be the best deal. Ideal if you don't need bottom line prices since the app is so easy to use that it's quickest just to purchase through it.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-09 5
One of the easiest to get info from
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-09 5

Version 25.0.1 2013-05-09 5
I've used this app for planning many trips so far and it's saved me a LOT of money and headaches. Definitely worth the download even if just to look at prices (it shows the best deal whether they have it or not)
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-09 5
Sometimes I  get a better deal here than buying it with the airline carrier.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-09 5
Great app. Convenient. Thanks!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-09 5

App kicks out alternate dates for air travel. No Kayak, I don't want to travel on Tuesday.  I said Wednesday.  The site works fine. App is lousy. Worthless download.
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-07 5
Easy and very useful.

Very efficient app. Easy to use, all flight options at your fingertips
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-05 4
I only used the app for half an hour but already found hotels at 1/3 of the price as the other travel sites at one of the busiest and most expensive travel times of the year. So far very helpful...
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-05 5
Since I need to know things as I'm on the move, this is perfect. I can do everything on my phone and I love it. This is great for my lifestyle.

Relative to other travel / booking apps this one does all: car , hotel, flights.  I find it hard to understand why other well known travel COs are so behind in this regard.  Good job Kayak.

Love this APP!
Version 25.0.1 2013-05-04 5

The app does not allow up front to select a senior but catches it later after all information is entered. Then, unfortunately it blanks out information when it assists you to fix and you have to enter it all over again. Then you find out the data has to be refreshed and lose information again. Then it tells you the flight is no longer available.
Version 25.0.1 2013-04-30 5
Great app, easy to access and never fails. Best website ever, it gives me the best value for everything. With these prices it feels like I can travel at least once a month :D

Honestly this is an amazing app! Except for when it changes when I'm not on it for awhile, I wish the screen would stay as is so I wouldn't have to click back through flights.

Version 25.0.1 2013-04-27 5
Good work!
Version 25.0.1 2013-04-27 5
This is the easiest travel app I have ever used. It's much easier to find what I need when planning a trip than going to a myriad of different sites. I really like how it includes applicable taxes and fees with the hotel's room rate.

Version 25.0.1 2013-04-26 5
I use it mostly for finding flights but I find its usability to be great and the aggregation while lacking some of the low cost carriers is fantastic.

I'm just a tween.
Version 25.0.1 2013-04-16 4
Overall a good app for a great site. However, I wish there was a way to filter flights by frequent flyer program, like the site allows. I also consistently have issues with my history of searches showing up, and have to shut down the app and restart to get them to show up again.
Version 25.0.1 2013-04-16 5

App works fine, lacking information about car rentals. The app only gives information on car rentals near or in the airport. Because of that my activity with this app has been lowered significantly.

The information & the detail of that information blows every other search engine (ie tripadvisor, Expedia) out of the water.
Version 25.0.1 2013-04-09 5
App is awesome! Does find u lowest rates but wish would let u choose different flights to add to total trip if displayed times are compatible.

Gives you great prices, when you go to book it, it states: "flight no longer available" and then virtually doubles the price. POINTLESS app, don't waste your time.

Version 25.0.0 2013-04-06 4
I really like this app!  I'm currently looking for flights for a trip I'm taking in July so I really like the option to create notifications for numerous dates and/or departure cities. The downside to the alert is that it only seems to tell you the pricing that comes out early that morning because there are times I've clicked on it to look at current pricing and cheaper options pop up so I wish it would update throughout the day so I wouldn't have to go the extra steps to make sure the pricing is correct. I've even tried the refresh button on the alert page but it doesn't seem to do anything. All that said, I really like the app and love that kayak is my one stop shop when planning a trip.

Got best filter search
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-14 5
Love the fare notifier function. I stalk prices because this app also clearly tells me how many seats are left for the tickets I'm considering. 
Would be nice if they had a flag or button that let you know about each site provider's fare-matching policies if the price does indeed drop. 

When looking for places, I use TripAdvisor. When I actually book, Kayak.
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-14 5
Convenient and awesome
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-14 5
Great
Version 23.0.0 2013-03-14 5
It's the only app I use for looking up flights!
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-13 2
When searching for a flight It doesn't respond!!!!!
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-13 5
Love to use this app, especially for flights. Always gives multiple sites to buy from, and gives the final price (including taxes and fees) before you click.
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-13 5
Easy to use with alerts doing the searching instead of me.
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-13 5

So far so good. Quick & easy. User friendly.
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-10 1
They don't not stand by their word. I book a room, went to check in and room was never booked and hotel was full. Called kayak they verified said they give me a full refund in 5-7 days and I would need to book a new room at a new hotel almost double the cost, I had to drive home at 12:30 am almost 2 1/2 hrs away cuz I was out of money and they did not care. Bottom line this company is horrible!!!!
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-10 5
I'm only nine but I travel a lot so get the app it's worth it!!!

Kayak app used to be awesome.  Now every time I search for a flight it tells me 0 out of 0 results.  This has been happening for at least two weeks.  I thought it needed an update but there is not one available.  I'm certainly not buying the paid version of this app.  I'll use my computer.

What junk.
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-09 5

On the rare occasion I need to book or track a flight, I'm always impressed with this apps design. A top notch team must have worked long and hard to create this it's an excellent application. Logical and beautiful in its own way.

I love their Website, the only site you need for booking flights. This app is almost easier to use than the full site. Very well done.
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-07 2
This app is 5 stars if you don't use the explore map. It's the most useful feature.

I love the ease of use with this app!
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-06 4
I find it an easy site to use, it gives a lot of options, but have found cheaper flights on the airline sites sometimes.
Version 24.0.1 2013-03-06 4
Great app. Easy to use; shows price and dates without a bunch of gratuitous information. Have gotten some great deals so far!
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-06 5
I use this app all the time, and I don't even travel that much. Love it!
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-06 4

Found a great hotel for 99 a night booked it than the next day on hotels website it was 189! Such a great deal! On a four star hotel can't get any better than that!
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-06 5
I use this app every day to figure out the best and lowest cost ways of getting from there to where.
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-02 1
I never got it to show any flights. No matter what cities I typed it always said 0 flights.
Version 24.0.1 2013-03-02 3
The app is not as friendly as the regular site. Price alerts are sporadic at updating prices, hacker fares don't exist on the mobile app, a lot of extra steps to check flights +/- 1day.  The app is better than some others but far from superior.
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-02 1
BAD APP! FIX BUG
Version 25.0.0 2013-03-02 4

This is the first site I always go to for airfare and car rentals. I love getting good deals and especially love that the fees and taxes are included in prices.
Version 24.0.1 2013-03-01 3

Great job
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-26 3
Good app. However the functionality to pull info from an email id into My Trips does not work. This refers to bookings made directly at Airline and hotel websites without going through Kayak.

I thought the car rental carriers would have tons of additional fees! Not at all! Exactly as the app states!!!! It's like receiving employee pricing! This app is truly one of a kind!

Great App!!!

Simple quick searches. Much easier than Orbitz, Travelocity or others.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-17 5
This site is just wonderful for comparing prices and carriers. It is easy to toggle between pricing and flight duration priorities, and to chance your filters.

Great app for people who travel !!
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-17 5

Will be 5* if you could search cruises.

Love how I can search for flights with multiple stops. Makes it a breeze to travel! :)
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-16 5
This is by far the best travel app I own; and that includes the propriety airline and other supposedly comprehensive apps. More than that, they've made it simple, intuitive, and easy to use.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-16 5
Great app!
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-16 5

Kayak is great!! Search late to early morning for the lowest rates though
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-15 5
I love how this program compares all the airlines and makes it easier for me to find the cheapest flight. I also like that I can also narrow the search to how I want my flight to be. AMAZING!
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-15 5
I love to travel internationally and I use this app all the time. It's so easy to use and I never have any troubles with it!

Even easier to use than the website.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-14 5
Usually don't rate apps for a number of reasons, but this app is super easy to use and flights are sortable like you would expect from a desktop flight planning website.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-14 5
Love the fact that your app allows me to see all other prices of different companies. I keep going back for all your services.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-14 5
Great app and helpful
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-14 5
I am getting married and moving to Florida and have to travel a lot the next couple months.. This app is so easy to use and helpful!
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-14 1
Your app has prices that are advertised that aren't accurate. I had 2 tickets confirmed and was on PayPal to purchase for $310. Kayak would not let me approve purchase because they wanted me to buy flight insurance that I hit No Thanks on. Then the prices go up from $310 to $470 while I keep hitting No thanks on Insurance. I am deleting this app & going back to cheap tickets for my travels. Kayak is a disorganized Waste of time & energy
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-14 5
As an airline employee I find this app more accurate and timely than what my airline provides me.   International travel deserves a bit more attention however.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-14 5
Daughter getting married and several people coming for around the country. What a quick and easy way to compare prices. Thanks
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-14 5

Version 24.0.1 2013-02-13 5
A must have travel companion.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-13 5
The app has a beautiful and functional interface. Actually kind of fun to use. Also in the app it shows prices on numerous sites and will link you directly to the site you pick (lowest price) if you choose to book thru them instead of kayak.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-13 5
Love this app
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-13 5

This app is a new recommendation of a friend I want travel and I want find a ticket cheaper than other companies
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-12 5
Great app minus you can't put in traveler info for children. Had to open full website to do so.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-12 3
Great for searching prices, but if you use the app to go to airlines site and purchase, you can't use back browser if you click on a link. You lose all progress and have to start over again. I tried twice already to purchase a ticket and I am still unsure if the transaction went through. Frustrating
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-12 5
Awesome
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-12 5

Version 24.0.1 2013-02-11 1
App is just bad
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-11 5
I usually use a computer to search for flights but this app lets you drill down on flight info really easily. Good app! Now I'll have to fly more places.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-11 5
Works like it should
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-11 4
Pretty nifty. Great for quick price-check and on-a-whim flight planning!

Version 24.0.1 2013-02-10 5
I downloaded 4 different apps to find accommodations for spring break.  This app is what it says it is... Kayak made my experience to compare shop for best rates for our large group a success! I've already highly  recommended it to family & friends.  Enjoy w/ confidence!
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-10 5
Great app, easy to use and powerful.

Version 24.0.1 2013-02-10 5
Tremendo
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-10 2
Not great
Version 23.0.2 2013-02-10 4
Good App to check flight options quickly for business trips.
Version 24.0.1 2013-02-10 5
The failing of most mobile apps which are derivatives of desktop full site experiences is when they leave out most of the key features that make the desktop web so cool. This app doesn't make any compromises but instead covers them all plus a few cool things that only mobile lets you have. Enthusiastic 5 stars!

Used to be the best flight tracker app, but now it takes nearly 1 minute to launch the app and almost another minute to launch the flight tracker option, even if just moving between apps. In the app world, that's an eternity, and there are other free ones out there that get the job done quicker. Would be great if Kayak fixed it.
Version 24.0.1 2013-01-18 5

Kayak travel info on the App : excellent photos, concise info on location/pricing better than guide books
Version 24.0.1 2013-01-12 5
This app is so easy to use. FYI - you can't book your flight through kayak, it takes you to the airlines site, everything can be booked with kayak.
Version 24.0.1 2013-01-12 5
Works like a charm.

This is a good app but why can't you look up cruise deals and other deals like you can on the website? This app limits you to airlines, hotel and car rentals. That is my only issue.
Version 24.0.1 2013-01-04 5
Easy to use!
Version 24.0.1 2013-01-04 5

Version 24.0.1 2012-12-28 2
Still can't believe the trips screen doesn't store your data and instead requires an internet connection... Totally stupid and makes it worthless for travel.

Even worse, many versions ago they had this set up correctly and changed it...
Version 24.0.0 2012-12-28 5

Version 24.0.1 2012-12-28 5
Accidentally found this as 1 of the top 2012 *FREE* apps for iPhones on CNET Year-End Review (thank you CNET for the tip)! Immediately tried to use it for trip plans in March 2013. Was overtly impressed by ease in use, ability to filter & sort by travel options and found Kayak to offer even more options than the formerly used Expedia & for more reasons than I might rightfully name here! Lastly, for someone who believes I'm technologically disabled when it comes to trying new hi-tech options or apps, again I found this so easy to use that I was not at all intimidated ;)!!

Most of the time this is a great app. However, there are times I can go to the individual sites and find a cheaper price than what Kayak has said. Do some digging before you book.

The prices that the app is coming up with do not coincide with the prices at purchase point
Version 24.0.0 2012-12-17 4
Very good app, generally consistent with their website. The app has a problem with the filters, which are excellent on the website. However, on the app, the flight time filters do not appear to work. This could be likely fixed by their programmer.

I primarily used this app to track flight status & gate changes.  Unfortunately, it's been slow to notify or doesn't notify at all any last minute gate changes.  On several recent occasions, I found myself sitting at what I thought was the correct gate only to find out that the gate was changed 15-20 minutes beforehand. So I will instead rely on the old fashion method of reading the flight status screens at the airport.

This app is user friendly and very convenient. Kayak has always been my favorite comprehensive flight search website. I was able to find a flight for under $100 at the time and date I wanted in less than ten minutes.
Version 23.0.2 2012-12-08 5
I have been using Kayak for many flights to/from Boston/NYC to India/Nepal/Thailand/Australia and I have always got the best rates. The mobile app is robust and functional on the iPhone 4S.

Great app for traveling. Very easy to use.
Version 23.0.2 2012-12-08 5
This has to be the best app for flight booking. Unbelievable! The world map showing the rates to possible destinations from ur hometown - just scored home run with world record! 
The speed in which it returns the results is amazing. Seems seamless. I could give 10stars if available. 

For some reason, I can't view anything in settings. Any reasons??

This app not only helped me get the best flight prices but also the hotel prices. Came home for the holidays and as many know family time can get uncomfortable so I need a much sooner flight back to New York and a hotel for the next two nights in Chicago.

Searching nearby apts is nice but I wish there was a way to narrow those down. I live in LA and I have results from San Diego to Santa Barbra. Those cities are both 2 hour drives. Burbank is as far as I'm willing to go.

Version 23.0.2 2012-11-26 5
Though the Kayak app is a trimmed down version of their website, lacking some of the more robust filtering options, it still appears to access the same databases, giving nearly the same results on the fly. 
A fantastic tool for those in a hurry, or wanting to do preliminary pricing research while away from their computer.
Version 23.0.2 2012-11-26 4
Very useful and like the rate change notification feature

The only thing I don't like about this app is that is doesn't give the city and of the airport stops when looking for fares. Change that feature and you get five stars. 

This is a must have app for people who travel.

Easy to search flights, but the real value is the My Trips feature. I use it every time I travel to track all my reservations including rentals and hotel confirmations. I'm emailed updates on flights which has let me know about delays that have kept me from wasting time sitting in airports waiting for delayed flights. Highly recommend.
Version 23.0.2 2012-11-07 1

Easy to use. If you are traveling a lot you definitely need this app
Version 23.0.2 2012-11-01 5
Only improvement could be the flexible dates on flights. Otherwise I'm a super loyal user of this company. Best by far.

I enjoy being able to check airline prices quickly and flight status.
Version 23.0.2 2012-11-01 3
I really love this app but right now I'm trying to do a search with flexible dates which produced results, but when changing back to specific dates, the previous results remained, despite shutting down the app or trying another search before going back to it. I faced the same problem on both my iPhone and iPad and it makes me angry to encounter such an odd problem in an otherwise flawless app. Please fix, thanks!
Version 23.0.2 2012-11-01 5
Easy, fast and helpful! Much easier then using a computer!

We use this app weekly for family, solo, and work travel. Super simple and incredibly useful.
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-29 5
This is one of the best apps on the iPhone. Well designed, fast, polished, and very, very useful if you travel a lot. If only all my service oriented apps were this good. The specific airport info you get with the Pro version is great. Worth paying a little extra for.
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-29 5
Probably one of the best apps to search for airfare. The programming mimics the website and craftily adapts to the iOS GUI quite nicely.
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-29 5
I like it a lot!

Version 23.0.2 2012-10-26 5
I use it mostly for airline tickets.  My wife still uses Orbitz.  It takes her longer  and she does not find as many cheaper flights!  I like Kayak and use it on a regular basis.  It has not crashed or done anything that it is not supposed to do.
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-25 5
Awesome app, very helpful at least for the flights which is what i use all the time

Version 23.0.2 2012-10-24 4
Good could use more day filters on +\- day searches
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-23 1
Yeah its easy to use and all, but the app does not give you the lowest price! I'll have one price on the app that is $70 more expensive than the actual website on a computer! Ive even checked it five different times because i couldn't believe i would have saved myself almost $100! I am SO disappointed..
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-23 5

Version 23.0.2 2012-10-22 4
I love this app. One stop search for hotels, don't have to search the rest of the sites. This app does it for you.
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-22 5
It's clear and useful . Very impressive
Version 22.0.0 2012-10-22 5

This app is a must have if you are a traveler that doesn't like to spend top dollar for their tickets!! If you like to waste your money and buy the first expensive ticket you see then please by all means do not download this app - otherwise you'd be a fool not to....it is such a great and easy tool to use on your phone/iPod/iPad to be able to compare many airlines/hotels/car rentals all at once and then get the best bang for your dollar.
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-21 4
Easy to use
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-20 3
Just a ok app cause it advertises find low prices on hotels and have found them way cheaper on other sites
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-20 3
Doesn't let you do a specific search and doesn't give all details. Wouldn't recommend for big trip
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-20 4
Love the app and the UI. Slick and simple and clear. 

Price alerts setup is confusing though and prone to errors. Email. Notification. Daily. Weekly. Ugh. Show me a simple list. 

Also, the alerts I get seem to highlight the result in USD but show the currency indicator as the local currency. Bug.
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-20 5

FACIL DE USAR E VERSATIL
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-03 3
Not just adult options but have infant , children or seniors to fix the price of flight tickets
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-03 4
The web solution asks for children age, while this app does not, therefore the prices shown differ to the point that the web results are usually cheaper. Need to fix this issue on the app ASAP.
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-02 5
I recommend it
Version 23.0.2 2012-10-02 1
I try to filter the flys but it's impossible !! So sad

Great search filters but then the end result most of the time is "prices not available".  I'm going back to Priceline.
Version 22.0.2 2012-10-02 4
Excellent application just need some more places to check in

I'm on the road at least three months of the year, and I use the Kayak app constantly. It's so nice not to have to bust out my laptop in sketchy places around the world--plus, I can track fares quickly so I can act quickly. :) The app is quick and has a great interface.
Version 23.0.0 2012-09-12 5

Information on items selected is poor not the same you can see on web, as for ex. Hotel don't show type of bed or cars don't show which models are in that categories.
Version 23.0.0 2012-09-12 3
Easy to use but no deals! Every app is the same. Where are the deals??? Come on in this economy no one wants to fly because it's so expensive!!!!!

I have had Kayak on iPhone and finally tried to forward itinerary. Didn't work for repeated attempt. Felt bummed because this is a nifty app. Emailed support about situation.

Downloaded free Tripit. Forwarded itinerary. Voila! In Tripit. 

Checked email and saw reply from Walter. Needed to logout and log back in. Itinerary in Kayak.

Would give this 6 stars for Walter. Art company. Hate auto email saying I will hear from someone in 24 hours. When I deal with a technology problem I get impatient. Thank you Kayak for your great app, customer service model and Walter!

I used to rely on this, but after the last update neither flights nor airlines will load. It can't even "find" New York airports. Frustrating. Hope they fix it!

Great app! But I just received a call that my flight was delayed (united flight 1946 from CVG) and kayak still hasn't updated the flight status with the delay. Fix that bug!!! Great otherwise.
Version 23.0.0 2012-09-03 4
Honestly very few people have time to search in depth for fares from their phone that they wouldn't just go and grab a laptop so I love that this app makes quick and thorough/ comprehensive  searches for fares and hotels easy and shareable in a few seconds.  I like that filters come after the main search to make the initial search easy.  Other apps restrict you to less carriers or they over complicate the search.  If you want complicated that's cool.  But I'd you want simple an quick this apps for you.
Version 23.0.0 2012-09-03 5
Information at your fingertips in seconds.  Love it.

For example, when searching for cars with automatic transmission- with option selected in app- still yields results with manual transmission. Generally the app is not sufficient for my needs and I end up going to the website. Wish the two were fully in sync with the same features and functionality.

It's the industry standard for a reason: it's the best. All the airlines plus all the surrounding airports within the flexible date range you are thinking of traveling makes for the easiest way to book your flight.
Version 23.0.0 2012-08-29 4
The Kayak team never ceases to amaze. This is by far one of the best travel apps in the iTunes store. I specially dig the trip planner feature. Just mail your confirmed reservations to kayak and see them magically updated on your saved trip, hotel details ,maps, confirmation no. et al
Version 23.0.0 2012-08-29 5
I've used this app for a hotel room and plane tickets. It always finds the best prices, and is easy to use!

Version 23.0.0 2012-08-24 3
Really useful app with a big problem in one of its best features: the price alerts. When I chose to monitor a specific route on specific dates the date parameters are sometimes off (usually by one day) in the created listing (and even in the resulting email).

Book all my flights using Kayak!
Version 23.0.0 2012-08-16 4
I have only used this app for looking for flights but the interface is slick and let's you apply many filters that I find useful. Voting 4 stars because when selecting what time you want flights to takeoff/land it incorrectly displays the order airport names (I.e. it will say "Indianapolis to New York City" twice, when one of them should read "New York City to Indianapolis")
Version 23.0.0 2012-08-16 5
Still hasn't crashed even once
Version 22.0.2 2012-08-16 5

Wonderful app that works perfect.
Version 23.0.0 2012-08-13 4
As our office's resident travel agent, I find myself needing to book travel at all hours. The kayak app lets me do that -as long as I've got service - from wherever.  I wish you could set up filter choices from the very beginning, and it's a little tedious to get to flight details, but otherwise, it's very intuitive and user friendly.

Worth downloading. You won't regret it!

If you find a cheap flight and you click to book, you will find that the flight is no longer available. It's a way to get you to visit orbitz or cheaptickets. This happened to me no fewer than fifteen times this evening. Was eventually able to book using Hotwire.

Version 22.0.2 2012-08-06 5
I like it
Version 23.0.0 2012-08-06 3
I think this is one of the best apps out there for any category because it allows you to do everything the website can do. How many web companies can boast that? And kayak is great for flights, hotels (I just got rid of expedia's hotel app because kayak works better), travel plans (I also don't use tripit anymore), etc. So great app. 

The reason I'm giving it only three stars is that the flight alerts that kayak emails you (a service that you'd think is very useful) will send you prices that someone else got beforehand and are probably no longer available. How absurd is that. I mean, seriously, how can that possibly be useful? I like Bing Travel because they have a price predictor to tell you if prices are likely to go up or down. I like the idea of getting alerts to find out when prices go down. But Kayak's implementation is idiotic.

This is an excellent very useful travel app which keeps getting better and better. I use it to contact airlines, to book and compare fares, etc.  I hope the developers keep improving and refining it in the months ahead.

Easy to use!
Version 22.0.2 2012-08-05 4
When you go to price alerts > then edit, it only gives you the option to delete a flight you want to be alerted for, you need to add the option to shift them around and move them, because I'm trying to find a cheap flight from several different airports in both places so I need to be more organized!! Please update!
Version 23.0.0 2012-08-05 5

Nice App
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-28 3
Got this primarily for Flight Tracker.  App a little draggy, not much detail on flight status.  Doesn't tell distance travelled or distance to go.  Was also WAY behind actual flight, by almost 20 minutes.  (Didn't show departure was delayed by half hour).  But absolute worst of all, flight tracker didn't automatically update.  Had to keep hitting refresh to get "latest" (20 minutes behind) location.  I expected better, and have seen a lot better from PC apps.  But, it's free, and not a total bomb.  Maybe upgrades or better collaboration with flight data providers in the future will make this app worthwhile.
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-28 5

I've been using Kayak since it first came out as an Internet service.  The app works well, I always check Kayak first when planning travel.
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-28 5
Great
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-26 5
Used to use skyscanner, but this app is so much better. One improvement I'd suggest is keeping a filter activated when searching through different days or airports. For example, if I only want to see flights departing after 2 pm, then I don't want to keep applying the filter when I change an airport or date.

Other than that, I'm obsessed!
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-26 5
It's easy, convenient and DEFINITELY helped me find the best deal!
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-26 5

Version 22.0.2 2012-07-22 5
This app is very easy to figure out and use without much thought. I wis it had an option to search for B&Bs - maybe in another version... This would also be a must-have for any business traveller or salesman!
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-22 5
Use lots of different apps to book travel. This is the best.  By far. Love it.
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-22 5
The best el mejor
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-22 1
It used to be the best app to compare airfares, however for about a week I just can't search for any cities (airport or city for car rental). The search doesn't pop up any result: I can't select my origin and destination. The app has Internet connection as I can perform a search if I keep the current field values (and I get different prices for different airlines).
Please fix ASAP!
Update: I'm in Hong Kong and the issue has been ongoing for several months now!
Update 2: When I use a VPN to get a US internet access, the app works fine. So basically when connecting from Hong kong, the app can't retrieve cities list....
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-22 5
I m from outside US and it works good for me... Nice travel assistant...

Found flights that the other low price sites couldn't or wouldn't display. This is easy to use and book your flights within the app. This is great.
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-22 1
Ok. I love this website and have purchased all my flights from it for the last few years (6-7 flights). 
That said, the app keeps wasting my time by not coming thru. 
I get to the flight I want and it goes to "an error occurred...blah blah".
Come on

If you know your exact dates, this app is great. If you're flexible want a calendar that shows cheaper flights, try TripAdvisor. I can't believe Kayak left that feature out of this app.
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-15 4
This app is easy to use and book from. The one huge omission when compared to their full website is the lack of "flexible" dates feature. If this feature were ported to the app in a later release, then this would merit 5 stars.
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-15 5
This is a really great app !!

My go-to app for traveling.
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-12 3
When searching for car rentals, the results do not indicate the details of the car. For example, I'm looking for car rentals in Europe and there is no indication as to whether it is a manual or automatic transmission until after leaving the Kayak  application and going to the website itself. Time waster....

Version 22.0.2 2012-07-12 4
I pick random destinations and see if kayak can get me a ticket for less than what I have in my checking account.  It usually finds me some place interesting and then I log off and go buy groceries.

Version 22.0.2 2012-07-07 3
This app presents flight schedules, hotel rates, and car rentals in such a way that you'll want to book it immediately. This is mainly because of its sleek design and very simple approach on navigating through its interface. However, if i were to choose between Kayak and Skyscanner, I'll definitely choose the latter.
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-07 5
I have not found another flight searcher that is so easy to use and consistently finds the best values. The app is fast and I love the travel organizer options.
Version 22.0.2 2012-07-07 5

I use this app for business more than anything and at times for personal. 
Great tool for me the way I use it. I don't use it to book the rooms, flights but rather keep track if the bookings through this app and to help me get pricing.

BEWARE: The flight search result that you see listed is totally for DIFFERENT DATE than what you originally selected. So be very careful, always keep an eye on the date until you purchase tickets.

The problem occurs because we are used to taking for granted that  once we choose exact dates while searching for flights, we tend to ignore the dates and concentrate on price and timing in  the search result. But this app "automatically" assumes that we are searching for flexible dates and gives the best price for a different date than what you originally wanted for. Although it shows the date in the results, most likely it will  be for a different day, often we ignore to look at it carefully. Please be extremely careful if you want to use this app.

Hey Kayak folks, Please don't ASSUME flexible dates while searching and displaying results!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-27 2
The "current location" feature does not pick up Charlotte, NC. As another reviewer mentioned regarding Dallas, this is a major hub. The search feature for airport destinations also doesn't work. I typed in my destination and the wheel kept spinning but didn't pull up anything. Seems the location feature is terrible overall. 

The app worked for me in the past, and it was great. But I think they have a bug now.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-27 5

Beware! I made a non-refundable hotel reservation without realizing it using this app! Kayak customer service says that because you get an email confirmation telling you about the non-refundable hotel room after you book it, then you should know - but that is only after the fact! I didn't realize the room was non-refundable using the app. I will never use the app again!

Best app for fast flight!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-26 5

Version 22.0.2 2012-06-24 5
Great to check flight stats, departure times, etc. the mobile app returns higher prices than the actual online app, though. This has happened a few times within an hour of checking each. The prices could have changed in they time, but it's been pretty consistent.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-24 5
Awesome app. Very user friendly and convenient. All it needs is to do is make an option to select room only or all inclusive when I reference to hotel selection. Still a very nice app.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-24 3
Needs reset on change price update
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-24 1
Horrible App. Crashes everytime you click on a hotel listing and try to do something like look at photos.  50/50 chance that Kayak's airfare is correct - half the time when you find a fare and click to book, the Kayak listed fare is no longer available.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-24 4
The only thing I don't like is inability to select non-stop flights or hotel ratings BEFORE the search. Because of that search takes longer. It would be nice to have an option to "filter" before the search.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-24 5
So convenient.

This is an awesome app :)
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-20 5
Worked quickly and easily as I would hope. I especially liked the ability to easily reference each airlines baggage fee policies which made the cheapest flight not the best choice in my situation. I'm just glad I'm not the guy that is banned from Kayak for life.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-20 5

Overall the app looks nice and searching is easy but every time I select a flight, the prices and sometimes the hours shown by kayak end up being very different than the real ones. That completely defeats the purpose of the app.

Love it a lot!

The best!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-14 5
So easy and quick. Simple and the cheapest flights!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-14 2
Used to be a great tool, however on this version searching for anything seems to be broken. I can't even get it to send feedback. I have deleted the app and reinstalled numerous times. Hope it's temporary.
Version 22.0.1 2012-06-14 5
I have used Kayak mobile in US and internationally and it is the best. I am currently in Chengdu, Sichuan (China) and I'm planning a 50 mile bicycle ride and kayak has nice hotel rooms available at my destination for $41. Cheaper than the local travel agency. 

And don't worry about comparing this app to their crappy website. It is a single site app and doesn't have any of those annoying pop-up sites. It's one of the best apps for booking hotel to hostel rooms, especially late minute reservations.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-14 5
Great app
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-14 4
Easy..and fast to book hotel flights and cars.. Used the app to book both my Canada trip and Puerto Rico trip this year.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-14 5
Good
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-14 5
Great App!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-14 5
Just like the title says. I may not actually use it to book my flights or hotels but it let's me know what is out there.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-14 5
Really usefull app

Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 2
The alp quits after searching a multi stop flight itinerary. Must be un installed to and reinstalled to work again.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 5
Intuitive, easy to use, and high-functioning app that makes searching for the best travel deal something you can do while waiting in line for coffee. Love it.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 5
This is a great app with an extremely user friendly interface. 5 stars.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 1
I had a lot of issues pulling up prices on hotels. Everytime I tried to check a price on a hotel it says error pulling up prices. Very frustrating considering that what the app is for. Definately needs improvement!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 5
Just an incredible app. Surly my  Most enjoyable app experience. 

Thank you guys so much.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 5
I usually book my flights directly with the airlines but this is a great way to find where to start.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 5
It's so organized too!

I love this it soo good!!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 5
Just used 3 different flight apps and this one had the lowest fares :)
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 4
What a great app. Easy to use, and finds the best prices for air, car and hotel. Makes booking easy. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five starts is that the app does not allow for saving various airfare/car rental/hotel combos to price out alternative itineraries. I need to type the info into a spreadsheet for each option (i.e., do we trade off the cost of a lower connecting flight with a nicer hotel or should we visit one city or another based on travel prices, etc. --- Kayak: food for thought for a future release?)

In any event, the app is wonderful and we plan on putting it to good use!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-13 5

Kayak is our 'go to' app for travel planning.  Been using Kayak since the beginning, even preceding when it became known as Kayak.  Meta search travel is the only way to search.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5
Really good app
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 1
I tried booking a flight for a certain price when I clicked it redirected me and the price was almost double what kayak was offering. That is awful!!! If you can't offer it at that price then don't advertise it for that price!!!! That's false advertising!!! I tried calling customer service and you can't get ahold of anyone unless you have their extension!!! Talk about a bad company!! False advertising and can't talk to anyone??? How do they stay in business???
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5
Very informative
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5
Love this app. So easy to use!  Thanks.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5
This is an app where you can tell time and dedication was put into it. Works very well with the iPhone 4.

Kayak itself has good service and amazing low prices on airfares. You can't go wrong with it! Can't really say much about hotel hunting though, so I will leave that for other app-users of Kayak to rate and review on that.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5
This App does it all. Flight purchase/tracker/check-in, hotels, car rentals, currency converter, attractions, it even shows the airline fees for each carrier and many more...
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5
Great

Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5
Too good
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5
I like this app better than any other travel app. You can always find the cheapest price here, cuz kayak doesn't sell ticket istself, but provide the comparison between other travel websites. And there is a very cool function there, u can choose your departure city by simply tapping on the map, to see the cheapest price to any country on the world. I really like to play with this!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5
Best deals I can find
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-12 5

Better, more streamlined than the actual site! No pop-ups, such a clean, fast interface. Beautiful...

Version 22.0.2 2012-06-11 5
Almost always finds the cheapest price, only once has it not and it was only by $40. Recommend for anyone who flys regularly or just a one time flyer.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-11 5
Kayak.com has been a key tool for planning my summer vacation, I don't know how I ever traveled without it?!

Version 22.0.2 2012-06-10 4
Works great
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-10 1
The price for flights shown on the app is different from the website it takes you to. I was happy to see a price in the range I was looking for but kayak took me to jetblue's website and the price for that same flight was $80 more. Very upsetting!!!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-10 4
The app is very easy to navigate, clean and clear pictures and diagrams, and just a very easy app to use, just as easy as going on to your desktop or lap top.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-10 4

Kayak has been the best in its class for 5 years by now. Why use anything else ?
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-10 1
Looking fir tickets to Europe, this app has shown me many times already cheap prices that, when I want to book the tickets, DO NOT MATCH the prices shown by the airline.  The diference on the prices was major!!!  Plus, it is almost impossible to contact anyone when a problem like this comes up.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-10 5
This is great and easy to use
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-10 5

Version 22.0.2 2012-06-09 5

Version 22.0.2 2012-06-06 5
I was looking for a cheap hotel in Denver at short notice and decided to use this app to book. Not only is it streamlined and user friendly, but it's extra features (packing lists for example) go above and beyond the call of a travel app. Upon arriving at my hotel, the ladies helping me check in had lost the faxed booking information. Luckily Kaya has exceptional customer service. I spoke with Jessica, who was friendly, articulate, and quick to solve problems. She faxed the info again while remaining on the line with me to make sure they got it, and all was well. I would highly recommend this app.
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-06 5
I use it all the time to book my flights!!!

I love Kayak, and its app is just as great! Very intuitive and touch-screen friendly interface. Sometimes when passing over to the airlines' sites, your search can be lost. But I blame the incompetent airlines ;) This app makes the nightmare of navigating complex airfare scheduling a snap. Highly recommended!

I just downloaded today, and I'm loving it already! The UI is so clean, and the prompts are intuitive enough to jump right in. Not to mention, I've found some sweet deals on 1-way flights for our multi-city wedding/honeymoon trip this summer. 5 stars easy! I even prefer the app to the kayak website. Well done, Kayak development team!
Version 22.0.2 2012-06-03 3
App needs to integrate with the website more fully. App does not often contain updates or changes.  I find that it is easier to access website through browser and keep the link on my page than use the app. Still has away to go.

Awesome app,makes getting my Marine home a breeze!

Version 22.0.2 2012-05-30 1
This huge application jams up my 16GB 3GS.  It is so large that the update won't install unless directly connected to my computer but it still tries to update and causes no end of problems on the phone.  It sometimes locks the phone from making calls, interferes with other applications and when you attempt to actually run it, it does absolutely NOTHING!.  You can't even delete the miserable thing.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-30 5
This is a pretty great travel app that I think will work well for most travelers. I'm used to using Kayak's website but the app is now my preferred method. Be excellent to each other! *guitar riff*

Version 22.0.2 2012-05-27 5
Very good app
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-27 5
It is so useful and so well made that it turned this annoying chore that is trip planning into something I look forward to. Forward an email and it making the data into your trip plan works flawlessly, even with emails in portuguese. I dare to say kayak is a truly revolutinary service.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-27 5
That's really a good app has good features
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-27 4
Super easy and user friendly. Very personalize able, I love using it and compulsively checking for the best rate. However it updates me on them anyway lol. I still use other sites but I rely on this one more.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 5
Perfect.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 5
Great functionality, clear interface, has links to the best deals.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 3
Well done Kayak, you just took the best travel search and messed it up. After the hotels update, the app just keeps crashing.
Beware! Do not update to the newest version.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 5
this is a very helpful website i recommend it to everyone ..
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 4
Excelente!
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 4
I have been using this app for a very long time and I like every bit of it. However, i would like to be able to add future flight itineraries unto it to as well. Keep up the good work Kayak !!!
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 4
Everything you need right at your fingertips. Love it
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 4
This app is cool. I haven't try to book any flights yet but so far this is cool app.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 5
Muito bom
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 1
If you use this app to book flight tickets, forget it. I was using this app to book my tickets to china. It gives out the same price every time I search, and tell me the price is not available anymore every time it double check. It really gets me annoyed.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 3
Everybody is saying how cool the ap is and how easy it is to use, but does it actually find affordable trips? Are prices accurate?
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-26 4
Great
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 4
Awesome
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 5
very easy to use.  Love the easy filtering features.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 4
I didn't really expect this much functionality. It even has a basic itinerary feature.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 4
Needs to improve the layout a bit but when it comes to booking on the go .... The kayak app is the best way to do it
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 5
I wish I knew about the last time I took a trip. I would have used it to book. I know what I'll use for my next trip....kayak!
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 4
I use this app extensively. However, it seems buggy when editing trips. It won't let me change flight times or other items. Also, would be helpful to add itineraries not necessarily purchased on the app.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 5
I have frequented this app, very useful and accurate. It has proved to be informative and helpful when making decisions when booking our hotels.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 5
This impressive app is even easier to use than their full website. Searching for flights is simple, even for special instances of one-way or multi-stop. You can use the app to set flight tracker notifications which make hunting for the best deal a snap. 
In addition to the excellent user interface, this app also provides information on baggage fees for each airline, contact info for airlines, maps for each airport, and a packing list.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 1
Some discrepancies between the site and the app.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 3
Is don't show how much is the total for my dates
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-25 5
Gives all the filters I need to find the best price!

Good app
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-24 5
I fly 100+ times per year, I rent cars every other day and sleep in hotels more than my own home.  I use Kayak to make it all happen.  Just download it.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-24 3
Easy to use. Con: app closes when searching using the multi-city feature.

Good usability
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-23 1
The app failed to convert the currency for a listed flight/train and kept the same amount or number. So midway in the booking process. 89USD became 89 Bristish Pounds. Very misleading. Attempts were made to contact Kayak but were unsuccessful.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-17 5
Best way to find a place to stay at any price range.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-17 5

Great stuff
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-17 3
Loved old app.  New one looks great, easy to use, but crashes

Kayak has nailed it!
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 2
Keeps crashing... And have to start search over...really ANNOYING !

This The best Travel app for the experienced and inexperienced traveler. So easy to use. Quick results! Just excellent!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-16 2
Not accurate enough and no option for least expensive travel time.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 5
Such an easy way to find flights, hotels, and cars. It's the best of all of the travel sites packed in one!!!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-16 5
Love it for looking up flights!  Very easy to use and the filters work great to weed through all the flights to find specific times frames.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 5
No hay nada mas q buscar
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 4
I really like how I can see $'s without forking over a card!!
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 2
I love this app and use it all the time, but, this latest update keeps crashing and renders the app unusable. iPad 3, IOS 5.1.1
Please fix it soon as this frequent traveler needs Kayak!
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 4
Allows me to stay on top of my travel details at all times on my trip.
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 1
The old Kayak HD app was a fast and useful godsend. This new version is just as sloppy and slow as any other airline website. 

Oh well. No more bookings via the app from me...  Sayonara Kayak... Seems you pooped in your own punchbowl.  But why?  The Fonz join your design team after some shark jumping?
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 5
Well organized
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-16 5
Awesome App!
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 5
The best Flight Search App for iPhone.
easy to use and very speedy.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-16 5
I love this app! I was able to use it several times, but the important time was when I was planning a girls weekend out. All hotels was trying to over charge because of the holiday but using this app I was able to get a great price!
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 5
A++++++++++++
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 1
This app used to work fine but now it just crashes without ever even opening.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-16 5
Best ever.  Better than using a desktop.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-16 4
This app is quick and efficient, save time and money on travel plans by using this
Version 22.0.2 2012-05-16 4
The only wish-list item for me would be 
to be able to crawl through all US airlines
(JetBlue, Southwest...)
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-15 5
Use for air & hotels. The grid is great.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-15 1
Seeing the features, I used it for a trip in parallel to using TripIt. Kayak is useless, literally. It got all my trip segments, so much so that it sends me reminders by email. If I access the website, my trip is all there. But in the app, I am told I have no trip! That is, when it allowed me in with my password because most of the
time, my seconds-ago changed password is rejected. Furthermore, the feature tracking "on time" flights informed me of a flight on time. Expedia and TripIt sent me emails that that particular flight was cancelled. Nothing from Kayak. Why pile up features when the simplest and most essential ones like "password access" and "my trips" are just not working? TripIt is the way to go!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-15 5
Love the look..easy to use and has come in very handy!!

Version 22.0.1 2012-05-14 5
Great app... Very helpful and user friendly!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-14 1
As soon as I started using this app I felt that it wanted to sell me stuff more than help me plan my trip. I did check a couple of flights and found that the prices were not exactly competitive--my local travel agent was able to offer tickets that were approx. USD 120 cheaper. I'm now using the TripIt app instead to plan my trip and am happy with it so far.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
This is a must to have app..
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
I love this app.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 4
Great app. Would be even better if I could have the option to check for direct flights on one way and non direct on the way back.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
Thank you!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
This is an amazing app! I wish I downloaded it earlier!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 4
Love the details. Used it to book my vacation to the keys. Very informative.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
Great for multiple bookings. We wanted to stay a few days in each stop. Kayak is also very good for picking up a car in one city and dropping off in another.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
This is a great way to keep all my business and personal trips organized in one place. It's very user-friendly. I love it!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
If you believe that not leaving the apartment is the perfect vacation, then this app is not for you. But if you desire to travel past you zip code, then this a must have next to fresh underwear and air. So get your travel check list ready and get out there. There is only so mug time you have to live, might as well get in debt over a plane ticket and hotel rather then the usual stuff. It's hard times, so do what I do, go to a beach you can't pronounce, have a drink you cant pronounce and have a personal tlc day/week/month. You deserve it.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
Love this app! It is so easy to use!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
It is a needed app for a traveller, very nice app, updated data all the time.

Love this app
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 4
Love Kayak and its options are the reason I use their website over others, but the app could use some tweaking such as adding arrival date for long time zone crossing international flights. I agree about the flex date options, would like to see more of that on here too. Otherwise...quick and easy to navigate!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 5
Great app and website. I live by it when traveling.  Don't leave home without it.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-13 3
Good for quick glance at airline rates, but does not allow same level of detail as Website (e.g. Flex date grid)
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-12 5
Time Saver!!!!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-12 4

Incredibly fast and user friendly.  A must have for frequent travelers!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-08 1
Absolutely pathetic. I booked a hotel room for my husband in San Francisco, paid for it al on Kayak. He went to check in yesterday and NO RESERVATION!!! The hotel calls Kayak and the kayak operator claims to have faxed the reservation info to the hotel, even though the hotel does not take reservations by fax. You'd think kayak would know how to make reservations with their vendors. Also, even though my credit card had been billed the payment issue was not resolved at checkin and Needless to say my husband didn't get into his room till past midnight.

My first time using this website was to book a flight to Tokyo, Japan. Now that I finally upgraded to the iPhone, (it was ab time!) I have reaffirmed how much I am absolutely IN LOVE with Kayak as my no. 1 go to travel agent!
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-07 5
Kayak has been recommended by experts because of its ability to check all the major consolidators as well as airline, hotel and car rental companies sites. I have relied on it for years. Having said that, the iPhone app is still a pleasant surprise. It's amazingly fast, flexible and easy to use.
Version 22.0.1 2012-05-02 5
All one can ask for, even easier than the full website!

Version 22.0.1 2012-05-01 4
Works good for me. Would prefer to search by time of day as well
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 1
It crashes and forces a restarts every time I try to search for a hotel within a date range.  Right after the list of hotels shows up, it crashes.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 5
Excellant
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 5
Nice options for flexible searches. Nice integration with calendars etc.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 5
Great app to find flights with all your requirements
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 1
The most important part: flight search does not work. App just quits when u try to search for an airport.  Website mo better. Wrong prices all the time.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 5
It's cool
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 5
This is the best app for comparing flight prices. The app is so easy to use. I absolutely love it.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 5
I've used apps from Orbitz, United, Priceline and others but all pale in comparison to Kayak. A truly stunning application that's a pleasure to use and doesn't appear to be slanted to one airline over another.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 5
Made it easier to view multiple airline at once. Tried it on my own took triple the time than kayak. Loving it so far.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 4
Works fine
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-30 5

I'm finding some great deals! Thanks kayak!!!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-29 5
This website is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!  I use a lot of different websites but Kayak is simply amazing!! The way it presents it's search results is a work of art! It's informative, concise and to the point! Great search & saves $$$.

So convenient and greatly laid out! Love it.  I have yet to book for my first time though... Hope it's simple.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-28 5
Great app. It has everything you need and even things you didn't think you did but once you see them you realize how helpful they can be. Very user friendly and aesthetically designed.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-28 4
Simple and easy to use, search all possible airlines quickly.
Version 19.0.5 2012-04-28 5
This is the best travel app in the app store.
Version 22.0.0 2012-04-27 5

Version 22.0.1 2012-04-19 5

I love the function where you give it a date and it gives you a world map with prices of where to go
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-19 5
This is just amazing! Travelling is made much easier now!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 5
I love this app!  I have been using Kayak to book my travel for a little over a year and find it to be a great site.  Having the app just makes a good thing even better
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 5
Perfect
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 5
Never seen or heard of a faster more reliable travel website.... From flights to cars to hotels.... Completely useful and helpful..... LOVE IT.....
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 3
good experience for a first timer user
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 4
This app is way easier than a few of the others.  It sorts well and remembers your last search so you can keep looking quickly.

The frustration is when you click in a flight to reserve it, so often the website it takes you to has already increased fares.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 5
This is a well written app. I only use the flight tracker but that works great and even shows the live map of where the plane is in the sky. Pretty sick.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 2
Every time I put ewk(new jersey) and search it chooses a different airport location like JFK(new York) and I hate that...once that's fixed then it's all good.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 1
The best price for a hotel out of 5 was $286. I went to Priceline and named my own price for that same hotel and got it for $150. Worthless app, they only search their own companies!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 5
You have a great product here.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 5
This is one of the coolest apps for sure.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 5
Great functionality, ease of use is also good.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-18 4
Very good overall.

Easy to find flights but the app sometimes freezes on my iPhone and iPad.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-13 5
Recommended.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-13 4
It's very good and easy to use

Definitely worth installing.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-13 5
Everyone should get it.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-13 5
La major aplicacion muy facil de usar y muy util al momento de reservar tu ticket para viajar. Kayak la recomiendo 100% positive

Me gusta. La app esta muy buena
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-12 5
Easy to use, hasn't given me any problems at all, has been very reliable.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-12 2
I was really disappointed that I could only search and book hotels for 4 people. We have 4 kids so this app is completely useless to me. Please update so those is us who have bigger families can search for rooms.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-12 4
Easy to use. Responsive and logically sequenced.  Sort functions didn't always seem to work after a search provided a list.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-12 5
Use it all the time. Easy to navigate, good choices.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-12 5
Great interface! Love it.
Version 21.0.4 2012-04-12 5
Great app for obsessive flight price checkers.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-12 3
Search and display great. When you go to book sites though, the experience falls apart. Delta, for example, isn't iPad optimized and you get stuck.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 5
Excellenta'!!!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 4
Super easy to use!
Version 21.0.2 2012-04-11 5
I love using this app it's quick and easy to understand. I get the cheapest prices to the exact time that the plane is leaving. There are many different times  available on this app also!!(: it's a must download it doesn't freeze no viruses and it's awesome !!!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 5
Love it! I search regularly and it always comes through for me.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 5
And their website is even better!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 5
Great App!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 3
I like Kayaks swift and reliable service, however, my app crashes on both my iPhone and iPad.
When it is fixed, I will rate this app higher.
Version 21.0.4 2012-04-11 4
I like the simplicity of the app & how you can search & modify your search faster than in the desktop version. However, I miss having the option to see charts & recent deals you get in the desktop  version.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 2
This app would be more effective if the flight tracker showed accurate gates and updated when they change.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 5
I have tried different travel apps, but never found something as good.
Simply, the best app.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 5

Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 1
Switched to the new iPad version because orig said it was being discontinued. New version useless. So what is being discontinued is my use of Kayak.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-11 5
This app is totally amazing. Great job!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-10 3
Prices are not always the cheapest.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-10 5
Best way to price tickets. Now if only I could figure out when I wanna go lol
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-10 5

Love it.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-10 5
This app is amazing. With its all in one appeal I was able to book a getaway car, find a cheap motel and a flight to Mexico all in just minutes. If it wasn't for Kayak they might have caught me. Thanks Kayak

$$$$ helped me save some
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-09 5
This app gives me a better idea of the hotel I am staying at, and at the same time delivers photos that I was unable to find on other websites.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-09 1
I just downloaded this new version.  Tried doing my first search.  It closed partway through, won't open now.  Old version worked fine. Darn!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-09 5

Amazing how so much Kayak has packed onto the iPhone with such ease of use. Well done!
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-08 5
I am a service member stationed overseas and Kayak's services have saved my soldiers and me hundreds of dollars with their seamless and comprehensive searches and services. There are a few other European airlines I would like to see incorporated, but otherwise a fantastic service.

I've been using Kayak for years, both on the iPhone and iPad and on the web. The I-apps are simple, intuitive to use, well designed and give me all the information I need to make a comparative decision.  Their customer support is outstanding and unsurpassed  with personal and helpful email responses to every one I've submitted, always within 24 hours - whether it's about a bug or a feature request.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-04 5
Purchase my tickets and hotel. Best price available
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-04 1
Just updated to this version of the app and it keeps crashing.  Features are great, but first focus getting the basics right.
Version 22.0.1 2012-04-04 5
One of the best ways to find a flight. Always use it first before checking a couple of other sites and buying. Never fails to disappoint. Better than the web version and as fast.

This is an extremely productive and useful app. I use it every time I travel, and book many hotels, cars, and flights through this app. It also has many useful info about airports, baggage, and additional fees. I highly recommend this app!

They're forcing people to use this app because they are retiring Kayak HD.  HD is far, far superior in info on the iPad and this Mobile version doesn't even come close.  Not even the PRO version I bought can touch the HD in terms of content.  Bah!

I needed to make a trip to dc for a college, so I downloaded kayak. The beautiful interface was extremely easy to navigate and I got the lowest prices easily. The trip went great, and I'll be using kayak again soon. I highly advise it for any trip you might have.

Version 22.0.1 2012-04-01 2
It's really easy to search flights. But after I booked a flight on AA, it showed me my itinerary, but I couldn't save it.
Version 22.0.1 2012-03-31 5
Easy to use. Great user interface. Kayak gives a good price comparison between other competitors, no need to search else where. I definitely recommend this app to anyone who is looking for a seamless searching and booking process.
Version 22.0.1 2012-03-31 5
I can find all types of hotels in places I've never been close to where I need to go. Perfect!

Version 22.0.1 2012-03-31 4
This app found me a cheap flight and was easier to use than the competition.
The only downside was that I couldn't change my reservation afterwards online at the airlines site. That might just be air Canada , haven't tried others yet.

Some parts of this app were good but ultimately I'd rather use the regular kayak online. The features such as search functionality and saving searches is just easier and better. I love the regular online kayak, this app not so much.

Completely unusable now. Opens for 6 seconds and then crashes -- every time. Used to be a great app. Now worthless. :-(
Version 21.0.4 2012-03-27 5
I have used the Kayak app for iPhone and Droid devices for years now and I loved it, but the iPad one is truly awesome. It has all of the functionality of the smaller app, with these gorgeous photographs and details built into it about the hotels. I am really enjoying planning my next trip with it. Thanks Kayak!

Their website is decent but this app is top notch, no doubt about it. Great interface, simple to use, fast, and easily share results. So far so good kayak.
Version 22.0.0 2012-03-27 1
Where do I start? Either you can't really book the flight (you are taken to some site with no booking option or you randomly cant get into Delta) or the real price is + 300 dollars. Or the app is down for hours at a time. Take your pick.
Version 21.0.4 2012-03-27 5

Version 21.0.4 2012-03-23 5
Great site
Version 22.0.0 2012-03-23 5
The most difficult thing I've used is the car rental section.  Emailing myself a reminder was all the way at the bottom of the web page.  I finally found it, but it was just easier in the flight section where everything was incredibly well laid out.  Really, I haven't seen anything to complain about.

A nice feature would be to compare selections instead of using emails for later comparison use.  That list could be compiled in-app and then emailed or saved somehow.  Also being able to search further away from the airports or near a specific address would be nice for car rentals.

Thank you for creating a great one-stop shop!

Very helpful. Clean and crisp response.
Version 21.0.4 2012-03-18 5
I have never been compelled to write an app review before but as this app is close to perfect, I felt I should!  The ability to search airfare for a variety of itineraries is unmatched. I am planning a trip and looking for the lowest fare in and out of several potential cities and I really feel that the comprehensive flight search and intuitive layout of the search results made it possible for me to save several hundred dollars. At a glance I could see carrier, departure times, duration of flight and number of stops (and of course, price!). Fare alerts let me watch the trends and the airport guides helped me to decide if that 13 hour layover was worth it. 

Overall an easy to use and helpful app.
Version 21.0.4 2012-03-18 5

Version 21.0.4 2012-03-17 1
App doesn't help much for finding accurate prices on flights. When clicking through to book flights, I often find they are no longer available. A list of alternate fares is shown, then when trying to book any of those, it turns out they are no longer available either (so why were they shown as alternatives?). Another one of my favorites is when I try to book a flight only to be told that the "fare" is no longer available, and the available fare is hundreds of dollars more than what was shown in the search results.
Version 21.0.4 2012-03-17 5

Version 21.0.4 2012-03-13 5
Kayak by far is an superior all around the malberry-bush winner once familiar with its easy to use features it's an enjoyable cyber-ride

Super convenient and easy easy navigation
Version 21.0.4 2012-03-10 3
Kayak is pretty useful ... If you have the exact travel dates or destination. Wish they had a way to just show lowest fare, regardless of travel dates or destination from home airport. Other than that, it's good.
Version 21.0.4 2012-03-10 5
Traveling with my family for a year. This app is great. I love the simplicity. I use it all the time. Wish that the airline apps were as we'll written as this.

I Travel for business a lot. Love the fact that I can mail all my travel details to kayak and it organizes the trips with hotel and car reservations. I have all my trips - past and future - on my phone at all times. Highly recommend it.

The only thing I would like to see is the option to download a trip and have it stored locally on the phone. Would help in international travel so that you don't end up with international data roaming charges.
Version 21.0.4 2012-03-09 4

Version 21.0.3 2012-03-09 5
The Kayak app is one of the easiest to use that I work with regularly. They had improved the interface and functionality considerably and I think it should be on everyone's iPad. There are a couple of minor interface improvements that could still be made but this is a 5-star app!

Version 21.0.4 2012-02-28 5
There's not that much to say to this app rather than I am a casual traveler with a lot of curiosity and this app being quick allows me to see the prices of traveling between my homecountry and whatever.

It is very swift and easy to use, nicely describing the flights , possible layover and costs.

Even easier to use than the website :)
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-28 5
User friendly and very reliable
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-28 5

Version 21.0.2 2012-02-27 5
I use it daily. The first place I go to start my travel plans.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-27 5
This app works really well and has a lot of cool features. The my trips part that keeps all your upcoming flights organized is really awesome. And the flight tracker feature is awesome. It crashes sometimes, but it's not a big deal at all. Great app, definitely worth downloading even if you don't use it to book flights
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-27 5
!!!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-27 5
Simply an excellent app for flight, hotel searching, trips planner etc.

My personal favorite trip planning, rate checking, reservation making, car reserving, etc app for the iPad.

Found great prices and deals! Glad I can book a flight, hotel and car rental all on one site!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-27 5
Easy to use and also let's you plan out the whole trip
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-27 4
Great app never crashes , user friendly fast and has a lot of other options
Didn't like that there is no option of hotel and flight or hotel flight and car combined. It's just give u one item at the time. Also doesn't help u spell check the airport name like other sites
And lastly I would love if I can only type the city or country and it would give me all the options of the airports in that region, but here I have to know the name of the airport and that's limiting.
Other than that its really fast and never crashes, also great features like currency exchange and packing "don't forget"list.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-27 4
...but hands down the best search of any travel website.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-27 2

Version 21.0.2 2012-02-27 5
Great app!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-27 2
Thought the last version was much better with its three pane approach.  Bring it back as it was so much easier to use and to keep track of your recent searches!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-27 5
Very user friendly and always finds me some amazing and inexpensive flights.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-27 5

I downloaded all the different free travel apps to see what gave me the best deal and shortly there after deleted all but this one. It surpasses all the rest by far!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-26 5
A friend recommended it and I loved it the site. Very user friendly.

Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 5
Love the "price alerts" feature!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 4
The only better app was the previous version on the IPAD which let me reorganize trip search results by six different variables.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 5
I saved a fortune by using this... AWESOME
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 4

The best travel app
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 5
This app is streamlined and functional and makes planning for travel easy. There is no longer that hassle of going from travel website the website think to kayak.   You can now book your travel arrangement with the touch of a finger
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-25 5
All apps should be this good!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 3
Easy to use, does not give all prices.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 3
Where are the Hotel & airfare packages?????  Works great for checking airfare rates and hotel prices but I want to see packages.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 5
Great app, easy to use!

Deleted TripIt, this app takes care of everything!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 5
It's the best!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 3
Great potential, but I'm trying to explore a multi-city trip and I seem to be blowing it's little mind. Every time I try to limit the airlines the app seems to crash.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-25 5
Sehr Gut
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-24 5
Love it
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 4

Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 4
I travel worldwide all of the time and can say that I use this app the most out of any other.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Very good app, great deals!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Easy to use and very convenient.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Very easy to use on the iPhone. Like it better than using kayak on the computer. So simple & easy.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Very good app.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 4
This is a good app.
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-24 2
I kept the app for over a year and check it to see if it's fixed. When I find a flight on the app the price is higher than if I do the exact same search on the kayak website. I do not understand why this is the case. The same settings and I ensure the depart same airport is selected in the website. 

This makes the app useless.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Works great.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Great app-can be in bed and check out flights and hotels!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Absolutely excellent. A good user interface is important to me, but so is finding the best prices on plane tickets. This app accomplishes both.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
So many helpful tools rolled into one!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Seems to work just as well as the website at saving you from having to search every airline individually. Runs pretty smoothly!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 4
So far so good!!!!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Family reunion coming up:)
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
All I can say is Awesome
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
This app is fantastically useful.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
This is how an app should be. Easier to use than a website, nice visual input and very convenient to use.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Easy to use, quick to search, love the outputs. Wish more search sites were like this app!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Almost as good as the full site
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-24 5
Love It! Very easy to use!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
The app combines many features in a way that makes them easy to use, and does a fine job of accurately incorporating data from emails you forward to it from airlines, hotels, car rentals, and the like confirming reservations made outside the app. Highly recommended - both the iPad and the iPhone versions.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
Love it
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
I love the fact that you can track the price of your flight.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
At first i wasn't impressed because my price alerts didn't seem to be updating.  The next day, though, they were.  After booking a trip through Kayak is when this app really shines!  You can forward the confirmation email to Kayak and EVERYTHING you need for your trip is populated in the app.  Simply awesome!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
Works like a charm
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
I predominately use the airline portion of the app. It is a great tool to get quick plane tickets.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
I love kayak and use it buy all my plane tickets. I can never find any other sites that are cheaper. Will always use it!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
Very convenient!!!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
Best airplain tracker app ever!!!!!!!!!!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 2
I have looked through it the prices are not competitive in fact there are the highest . I figured the hole reason is to get your Ipeople the best prices possible I think  maybe u guys can negotiate some type of deals with these airline since u are giving them business only when it comes from any apple products or when they log on to kayak .
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
great app. easy to use and it is very complete.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 4
So far I'm liking this app it's got great deals!:)
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
I can find the best prices & flights quickly. Love the filters. Intuitive, simple, minimal & effective. More apps should be like this.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 3
This app has good functionality but the app doesn't do much more than bring the website to your device's screen.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
A+
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
Love this apps, I don't have any problem .
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
I think it's helping?!?
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 4
Sometimes the quoted fare does not include all taxes and fees.  When you get to the airline ticketing website you find out the fare is higher.  I thought Congress made that illegal.
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-23 5
I book all my itinerary for work with Kayak. It just makes it easy and is all in one place! Good app.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-23 5
Easy and accurate!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-22 5
Looks great, easy UI, and a pleasure to work with
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-22 5
I found the app to be very easy and use full.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-22 5
Use it all the time on computer and iPhone/iPad app.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-22 5
Kayak is the best in finding the lowest price in airline tickets!  Their app is very user friendly.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-22 5

This app doesn't work, keeps freezing.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-22 4
The flight tracker feature is very helpful. I like being able to enter multiple flight so I know if there are delays ahead.

The app works just as advertised, use it almost every day to check for my next vacation.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-21 5
Best travel site I've ever used, and the app is just as great.  Good navigation, excellent use of screen space, clear and simple interface and options.  Makes it easy to check all the travel prices as often as you want.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-21 5
fast loading and good price!! love it!

This app really saved me on a trip to Orlando. Easy to understand and navigate. I definitely use this as a travel resource for business.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-21 5
It's the first thing I look at when planning a trip
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-21 5
I've used kayak for all my flights and it always gives me the cheapest prices  It's super easy to use and really helpful in comparing airlines, dates, times. Highly recommend !
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-21 5

1st app I use for any travel reservation. Easy to use.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-21 5
Great app don't make a purchase without it. It compares prices among the bigest players in the industry.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-20 5

You can see from here to there but you see it's not moving at all
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 5
A travel app worth downloading!!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 4
It's very helpful when I'm traveling. saved me the stress of sitting in the airport for hrs with a notification saying my flight got delayed.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-20 5
This is the way shopping for airfare should have always been. After you see how brilliantly simple and thorough this app is, you will wonder why we've had to muddle through hours of ineffective research and dozens of websites to find the lowest fare for the past 15 years. I have been liberated!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 4
Does what is says
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 5
The kayak app makes it easy to book flights on the go. I've used it while traveling to when my plans have change and have had great results.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 5
Quick was to explore all travel options!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 5

This is an essential app for any traveler or a wannabe traveler
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 5
I use it mainly for flight checks and it's great
Version 21.0.0 2012-02-20 4
I am curious though, why don't they include Southwest in the airlines? I would like better if they did.
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-20 5
I like that app!!!!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 4
Its is a great app, the only improvement needed is the number of clicks to achieve a reservation or to know of schedule, over all it is very helpful
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 4
Very useful and efficient app.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 5

Version 21.0.3 2012-02-20 5
This is as close to a one stop shop as it gets.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 4
Pretty Alright. I hate writing reviews.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 4
User friendly, intuitive. If you like Kayak there is no question you gotta have it!!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-20 5
Mejor no pudo ser, 10+!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-19 5
Highly recommend for comparing prices quickly.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-19 4
I went kayaking in Michigan once. But that's neither here nor there. This app seems pretty good.
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-19 4
Easy way to find values and faster reservation help

So far I like what I see.
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-19 5
Great app to quickly set up travel plans.  I turn here before using computer!!
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-19 5
This app is most unusual, it does what it says it can do.  Thanks for making life just a little easier. It is appreciated.

Version 21.0.4 2012-02-19 5
I use the website and this app is a great companion.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-19 3
Used to love it but the hotel search option has stopped working after the recent update.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-19 5
Great app.  Quick and easy
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-19 5
Need to trawl the many terrible airline websites looking for a decent price? There's and app for that and look no further than Kayak. Probably one of the best IOS apps out there.
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-19 5
Awesome!!!!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-19 4
One of the best tools for travel out there.

I got a great deal using KAYAK to book and buy my flight ticket to Africa. The price i got bits all the offer i received from local Travel Agents. Great App!!
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-19 3
Not too bad, but not too good!!!!!
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-19 5
Very useful..
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-19 4
Prefer it over the web. Keep up the good work.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-18 3
Good results, but could give us more options..
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-18 5
You find what you want in just a few seconds.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-18 1
The ap doesn't feature enough options to give a good deal. I was searching for a flight from San Diego to DC and least amount was $366 because they cater to American and virgin. Found a better deal on southwest ($230) by removing the middleman.  I guess the website is useful by removing my buyers remorse.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-18 5
This is the coolest travel app out there. I like how you can email your trip confirmations to kayak and have it automatically create your trip itinerary
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-18 4
Love it
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-18 5
Este App esta solo bueno
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-18 3
Good app. A little slow and sometimes frustrating. Just wish that kayak included southwest and AirTran.
Version 21.0.4 2012-02-18 1
No longer displays hotels in Los Angeles and Long Beach or Pasadena. Does work for Detroit, MI and Ontario, CA. Something weird with new update

Great
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-16 5
Have used Kayak for years to book flights, hotel rooms, and rental cars. They never fail to get me a great deal and offer the lowest prices. Saves me a ton of time because I don't have to search a bunch of individual sites and then compare. Kayak does all the work for me. Highly recommend this app and their website as well.
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-16 5
Great functions with ease of use. Thanks, Kayak!
Version 21.0.3 2012-02-16 5

It's great to be able to go to "My Trips" and have your entire itinerary with confirmation, flight numbers, etc in one location even if booked through various travel sites.   I recently traveled with 2 co-workers who had apps for numerous airlines, hotels and rental agencies...what a pain. This app is great!

Is it sad that I think this app is LOADS better than their website? The performance of their simple interface is so much more seamless and clean, no random windows popping up anywhere. And it's so easy to navigate around. The price alert function is awesome. I really like this and it's becoming a travel essential for me.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-12 4

Better than orbitz
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-12 5
I was able to plan 2 vacations for this summer using this app. It was incredibly easy to find and book the flights, car, and hotel rooms. I highly recommend this app (and also their website) to anyone who wants to travel. Who needs a travel agent when you can do it yourself for free, and much faster? Download it!!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-12 5
I really like this app! Easy to use and great for finding cheap prices for flights!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-12 5

Useful
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-12 4
There's an ease of use but once you search you can feel buried in all the info. If it was categorized or sorted for an easier interface than I would use it more than an old fashioned computer box thing.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-12 5
The best

Not too different from the web interface, which is good, hard to actually buy from it, which is less satisfying.

Use the packing list or design your own. This is just one of the useful options. Not to mention the usual suspects from a travel app. Kayak goes above and beyond; from the important to the fun info provided. Enjoy.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-10 5

Easy way to get tickets with out having to go to the travel agency
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-08 5
Let's be honest.  Most of business travelers travel to some small and unknown towns in some foreign counties.   Try Anshan, China...... It has all hotel and price and booking info....... Case closed!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-08 4
Use it all the time.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-08 5
It has many features and is easy to use.

Version 21.0.2 2012-02-08 3
I love this app and website. I wish if had the ability to sort out "pet-friendly" hotels. I will change my rating to five stars when that becomes available.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-08 4
Great design and rich search options this entire app is well thought out. I use it for almost all my travel searches.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
1st time user.  Found it very user friendly with useful features not found in other travel sites.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5

This is a very handy app lowest prices guaranteed
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
I have been using other various free and paid travel apps an this by far is the best. Major improvements since their first app release. Found better prices on this app than online!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
This app is extremely useful. Great for frequent travelers like myself. The app allows you to book your flight and fill out everything right from your iPhone.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 4
Great interface - very easy to use.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 4
Got this app 4 months ago. Works pretty well. Easy-to-use interface, lots of customization. It would be nice if the available flights gave an on-time comparison like Expedia, but that's a minor thing.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
When planning a trip or when making changes along the way, I always check Kayak. Results are quick and straight forward.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 3
Flight tracker stopped working after the last update. Shows up only for the first flight in any itinerary - disappears if you scroll down then up. Alerts don't seem to be working any more either.
This app has become more about selling travel and less about helping you track your trip in one place.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
This site is simply the best fro flight and hotel search...not only it has the best proces but also is so fast and user friendly. Thumbs Up for Kayak.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
This Kayak app is easier to use and more functional than the regular site, I love it.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
I love how you can upload photos from your phone!! It is so much easier than uploading from your PC.

The sort criteria are what make this app great...pick your airline (or exclude them), shortest duration, etc.  very useful.

Kayak works great on my iPhone and iPad and is my go-to app for all my travel plans and I'm a frequent traveler, for business and funsies
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
Nuff said
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
Was a heavy user of Expedia.com, until I shared w friend in California that I was searching for best airfare, to fly his way.  He asked me if I'd searched Kayak yet, and having literally surfed the web dating back to '89, (pre-graphics/text only days), I arrogantly said what's Kayak, thinking it would be a joke of a travel resource.  Interestingly, I've booked virtually every airline ticket since that trip in '04 on Kayak.  It is a must for both seasoned and non-seasoned traveler's, year-round... Love it!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 5
Is great for finding and keeping track of your travel details.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-07 2

I'm sure it's just a glitch, but this app crashes far more often than the previous version. I hope they fix it soon!

Logical functionality and reliable performance. Even better on the iPad!
Version 14.0.0 2012-02-05 2
I like the concept of this app, but it is buggy and frequently crashes, especially if you try to filter by things like star rating.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-05 5
This is a great and useful tool to find the best prices on travel. You will love this app.

Cheap flights? Nope. Deleted.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-05 5
Frequent traveler for business and pleasure. This is my favorite planning tool on the iPad looking for flights and hotels. Prefer it to Orbitz and Expedia. Only thing Bing Travel has on Kayak is fare history with the Buy/Steady/Wait information.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-05 5
Been using your service for six years and I can't find a better deal anywhere else. Thank you for being awesome and giving us an app that is just as good as the site.

This app is complete and quick.  Easy to get pricing on air, hotels and cars.  I only wish they had a "clear all" function to wipe clean earlier searches.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-04 5
All I can say is wow
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-04 5
Thank you for a straightforward and useful app!
Version 21.0.0 2012-02-04 5
Don't waste your time w any other travel app.  This is the best, easiest, and most accurate AND incl all hidden taxes and fees. All legit, up-front info for flights and hotels.  And free? Unbelievable.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-04 5
So fast, easy and helpful! Looking for a flight just got great for me. I would recommend this app to frequent travelers any day!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-04 5
This App is, NO DOUBT, one of my most used App's out of the many I have downloaded on my iphone!!!  I also want to make very CLEAR that this "Flight" App is an EXCELLENT App along with very EFFICIENT, USER FRIENDLY, OFFERS UNREAL DEALS, SYSTEMICALLY ORGANIZED, OFFERS  AWESOME SUPPORT, just in case, there is a very slim chance, a Customer is experiencing Difficulties of some sort, the FILTERS that are provided, WOW, make your "Flight" search even more simplistic & much quicker, the capability of being able to "SORT" such as, SORT by(Flights): Stops, Price, Time 
Etc. and my most FAVORITE Feature is the ALERT system, for example; I'm looking for a "FLIGHT" from Michigan to Los Angeles, CA on the following the Dates:  departing on April 21st & returning on April 28th...1 Traveler...Time?  Makes NO difference to me or for the party who is picking me up in Los Angeles, so, I just leave blank or as is, I think(???), a couple more tiny steps and I ALWAYS sort by PRICE, then I set ALERTS, meaning I choose any & all Airports from around my area of which I would NOT mind departing out from on April 21st, then I place in the airport I'm Flying into(Los Angeles, CA and I repeat this process for each Airport I would NOT mind departing from and from then on, it's very easy instructions of how-to-do to ACTIVATE your ALERTS!!!  Activating your ALERTS, basically, means whatever you set your individual preferences at, such as, AIRPORTS; TIMES(if any); PRICES; STOPS(if any); etc., etc., etc., whenever, let's say, there was a PRICE REDUCTION(happens daily, TRUST ME), you will, immediately, hear an ALERT sound to either your iPhone, ipad, etc.!!!!!  This is the BEST Feature, by far, as I've Booked 4 "FLIGHTS" now, all on the ALERT program, as all 4 times, the price(s) REDUCED, Significantly!!!!!  It was almost too Good to be True, but TRUE STORY!!!!!!  I LOVE this App and NOBODY could go WRONG in purchasing it, TRUST ME!!!!

Have lived off their website to plan/book my trips for both work & personal. Now with app I have quick accesses to trip planning at my finger tips.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-04 5
It is very helpful and because of it I'm booked for my trip!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-04 5
A truly world-class app that's designed with unbelievable simplicity & presents complex information with ease!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-04 4
I've been using kayak for years, the best way to see the rates once you think of a trip. The only downfall is, it doesn't have some smaller or private airlines listed like jet blue.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-04 5
This is the best iPad app for making and organizing all of your travel arrangements.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-03 5
First time to use 100% success! Will use again!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-03 5
New update works great! Worth having this app on all devices!

Great app
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-03 5
Phenomenal app it helps me a lot.
The only thing is that they should include jet blue and southwest airlines.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-03 4
Kayak consistently found the best prices for me, although it is sometimes difficult to figure out the routes without lots of checking. (Best Price often isn't the best route).
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-03 5
Good app !
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-03 5
Awesome app!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-03 5
Love, love, love the new app.  So fast and user-friendly that I find myself seating for flights just for fun.  Hands down the best airline search app out there.  

The +\- day search function isn't great and needs some tweaking.  When you search for +\- a day, the search result doesn't indicates what dates the flights you are looking at depart/arrive so you have to click into the details for each.  Also, you can't search either + or -, you can only choose both.

But for standard searches, this app rocks.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-03 5
A real time saving comparison of fights.

Very fast
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-02 5
Not as comprehensive as their web site but for an iPhone app, it's extremely good. If you use Kayak on the 'run', this app is great. I'm biased because I'm a big Kayak fan already.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-02 4
Great convenience. Good site.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-02 5
It's easy and web you find fares you can easily share them and email them. I like this app. Easy to use and gives the best prices.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-02 5
Easier than the website and very helpful to check prices while on the go. Seems to have the lowest prices of the other apps that I have used.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-02 1
The previous version of this app was truly awesome, with superb sorting capabilities and flexibility.  When I tried to use it this morning the old app said it was being phased out and no longer supported, and linked to this version.  What a nightmare -- the user interface is clunkier than the old version, and some sorting functions seem to have been eliminated.  Basically, I find this new version woefully inadequate, and truly worthless.  I am deleting it as soon as I submit this review.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-02 1
Since downloading, what is mistaken to be an updated app, it constantly shuts off.  At most, I'm able to run one search at a time. With it constantly shutting off, I have to constantly open the app and re-input my search criteria.  This app is terrible.
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-02 5
Even if i dont need this app i enjoy using it. Works fast
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-02 5

Did a great job of quick check on fares. Couldn't do better as an app. PC version of course has some adv due to having more space to show stuff.

This travel app beats all. Find the perfect flight at the perfect price at the perfect time...plus flight tracking, plus hotel search, plus rental cars, plus plus plus...FOR FREE! Kayak doesn't even charge booking fees so its a winner all the way around. Does all it claims plus some more. Great iphone layout. Thanksthanksthanksthanks.......!
Version 21.0.2 2012-02-01 4
If you have used this before online you will love the ease of how this app works. Gives a good variety of vendors to choose from.  A few upgrades could be made in search parameters but over all really pleased.

Version 21.0.2 2012-01-31 5
Has everything I need and more and it seems way simpler to use,
We use apps like these a lot and always when you need an airline price it's confusing because some don't show you the return fare as well , this is easy to punch in and it's all clear concise info right there.. Way to go will defiantly be using this and ditching the others
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-31 5
I love this app. I have found better deals quicker than any website I have used on the computer. It is fast, easy, user friendly, and you can manipulate little changes.

Have loved the actual website since it was released many years ago. This app is just perfect for the iPad, and I really like the clean appearance.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-31 4
Well.

Version 21.0.2 2012-01-30 4
It's a good app but all the prices are too  high

Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Awesome app to quickly check fares! Saved me over $400 on a flight.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
I use the Kayak app all the time to get estimates on airline prices. I love this app & I use it all the time.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
I was able to save over 250.00 dollars on Air fare for a vacation for me and my family.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 4
Only thing I wish it had is on a desk top computer it shows which days are cheapest to fly on... They don't give that option here in this app.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 1
The only reason I use kayak and formerly sidestep is to search +/- 3 dates of flexible airfare options. This feature is absent. I hope you add it in. When it's added, I'll give you a better review.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 4
Go-to travel app; always reliable!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5

Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
One of the best apps. Very functional!
Version 19.0.5 2012-01-29 5
Couldn't find equivalent, I hope to include all currencies.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
This is how iPhone apps should be designed. It is flawless.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 4
Pretty cool app.  I like that you can find flights quickly at your price.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
This app is so simple to navigate that I wouldn't even attempt to use another.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Highly recommended     :)
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 1
Picked multicity and then depart and then SFO - crashes immediately
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
This search engine provides all the best fares available!! Because of this site, there's no need to search any other site other than southwest.com for their separate fares. I've never found a better deal than on this site.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 4
Me like!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Love the feel and features!! Weather info on travel locations would  be good ..
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
...
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 1
The lack of date flexibility...+/- 3 days makes this virtually useless for me. I always end up using the website, which does not work properly on an ipad, so I end up having to wait until I can get to my Computer!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
This really a premiere site. Sharp, clearly helpful in every aspect of travel.
Everyone needs this on their tablet.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Very helpful!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
The new Kayak is a welcome improvement over the previous app. Little things like calendar pickers that are usable and easy access to the filters. Previous to this upgrade I would often get frustrated with the app and just use the regular browser version. Good job.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Love it! Especially the "packing list" feature. That won me over.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Hands down, the best travel app, and the best app for its intended purpose of all apps I've ever used.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
The most efficient app for planning a trip. I am still used to the old Version (Kayak HD)
I like Kayak HD filters more...but still an amazing app
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 4
I travel a lot and really like using this app as one of my tools
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Super useful for casual browsing or specific searching. Great interface and search capabilities.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Everytime i have to travel, kayak will be always the first and the last choice

My first choice. For finding great rates
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Love it. Single version for both iPad & iPhone.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-29 4
I have always used the web version, thought the iPad version was a great complement to the web version.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
It's essential to my travel planning.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 3
It's all good
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
Love it both on the iPhone and iPad. Too bad the iPad app doesn't show my saved trips, still a killer app.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 1
Add Taka as a currency .
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-29 5
This app makes my life so much easier!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
App says what it does and more importantly does what it says.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
It's great. Nuff said.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
If you are avid traveler, this is the only app you need. This app does everything. I will never use anything else but sidestep, I mean kayak.com!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 3
It's ok accept the prices go up when you actually click on a flight.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
This app is extremely helpful for those of us who plan our trips without use of a travel agency or "package site"
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
Finally takes the pain away.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 4

Use this app often for the flight tracker- occasionally for booking- both services are gr8!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
This is a great app! Easy to use, very simple.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 3
I love the flight search.  The hotel search needs improvement, specially to allow you to filter based on a map view or proximity to a zip code.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
Perfect for hassle-free paperless travel.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
Very happy with it.

Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
I have used Kayak in the past for business travel and it was pretty good. This update is awesome. I just forward my flight in email to Kayak and bingo it all loaded into Kayak instantly. What a time saver.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-28 5
Best designed and most intuitive UI of any app I've used. Simply beautiful and functional.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
This is a very nice app!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
Tons of great info about flights, airports, etc.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 1
Wanted to book a vacation with flight hotel and car but it only would let me do it separately. So I found this app unusable and had to go to full HTML site
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 4
This is the best travel software I have ever tried.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
It does all that you need it to, without being cumbersome or annoying.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 3
Is still convenient but I wish I didn't erased the old one
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
Thanks Kayak!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-28 5
The price is what I care about whenever I use the app. It's really amazing.

Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 4
Use this app all the time. It tends to be a
Little slow over 3g but other than that... Its a great app
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 5
I never write reviews for apps, but I had to for this one. Kayak is user friendly and easy to you, and has all the travel information you may need. I booked flights and hotels on it and never had an issue.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 5
Uncomparable better than any competition out there.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 5
Great app! One of the best apps to have for the iPhone! I think this may be the best app of all time. I would pay $70 for an app like this. I don't think that this app could be any better! This app amazes me on a daily basis and I cannot live my life without it!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 5
Best travel app
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 4
I like the ability to see how the prices change over time and as the holidays come up. Sometimes the daily reminders of airport fares show a $200 difference from one day to the next. Very interesting.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 5
The only travel app and website needed when looking for deals.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 5

Very useful and convenient!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 4
This app is so easy to use on my phone that I wish I could travel more often just to have a reason to use it!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 3
Works great. Maps could be better and would like the date selector to include the day of the week.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 1
I don't understand why the change to this new app. All the space on the iPad screen and you can't set the dates without having to bounce back and forth between screens?! The "old" app let you do everything right from one screen. Old app was easy and quite honestly, fun to use. This new one stinks. Update the interface back to the old style!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 5
Kayak has become my go-to app. for locating and booking flights. I used to use Orbitz. Kayak is sooo much easier to navigate and use.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-27 4
Newest app is great and easy to use

Good app. I hope they continue to develop it further
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-26 4
Kayak is a great site and this app does a pretty good job of bringing that to the iPhone in an iPhone-friendly way. Looking forward to enhancements, which I'm sure there will be, on the future.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-26 5
Great

Version 21.0.2 2012-01-26 5
It's almost as good as web, in some ways better.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-26 1
Flight tracker only up 3 days in advance. Price are always higher on hotel reservations.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-26 5
This new Kayak App is a significant improvement comparing to previous version. It works really good and is even more convenient to use then a web interface.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-26 4
I enjoy the app. Not perfect but getting better!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-26 5

I travel quite a bit and stay with one or two carriers but my wife will quite often fly on any carrier. This hits the mark on quick price searches.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-24 5
It's great
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-24 5
It's a very useful app and all in one thank you

Excellent - Quick and EZ
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-24 2
They killed a great site called sidestep. Kayak is falling short on their app. Nothing flows smoothly anymore. 

The developers should solicit input and act on it. 

Will re-review in another 60 days.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-24 5
I've been using Kayak for years and always find the best rates!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-24 5

Loved it
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-24 3
Great app except it is missing a crucial component that i love most about kayak which is to compile and alter my price alerts.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-24 2
Have been using this app for a couple weeks. I can't believe this is the replacement for their old app. I want to trash this one and keep the old app which allows me much more control in my searches.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-24 5
I LOVE the new Kayak app! It has more of the features you find on the website. I especially like the my trips feature!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-24 5
Great apps easy to use great for short notice booking.very good!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-24 1
The old version was much better.  They went the wrong direction with this update
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 5
Amazing
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 5
The best app I'm never have
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 5
I've only just started using this app, so this is a preliminary review. I was a little skeptical at first but curious, so I decided to try it. I have always wanted an app like this to keep my trip information organized in one place so I can find details like confirmation numbers, flight times, etc. very quickly. 

I sent my flight and hotel email confirmations and I was blown away by how accurately Kayak parsed out the information and place it into their in a simple and logical way.  You can still pull up your email within the app, but it wouldn't typically be necessary.

I'm looking forward to trying some other features but even if it only does this, it would be an awesome app for any traveler.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 4
Excellent options
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 4
Excellent app
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 4

from what ive seen kayak is on point and has a load of options i havent seen a better travel app
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 5
Works great. Super smooth. Love it!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 5
I always visit kayak before I book any trip. I work in hotels and I hate booking on Expedia or Priceline because the reservations can get lost. Kayak is the perfect substitute.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 4
Love it!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 4

Has great features! Very handy!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 1
This is a horrible service! I booked a flight through Kayak Connect and received an email from Kayak telling me that I can message them if the itinerary from Frontier airlines was different from what I ordered. 

Well it was different so I emailed them and all Kayak tells me is to contact Frontier to change or cancel. No I'm sorry or a list of other options. 

I called the airline only to find out that it would cost a total of $300 extra in fees to change my flight because that's the way kayak booked it and there was nothing they can do.

I'm very upset that kayak won't own up to the mistake and take care of the flight change back to my original flight time that I booked with them! I will never use kayak again and I urge everyone else to take caution because any mistake they make will be your responsibility
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 5
Awesome app, I recommend it.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 5

Version 21.0.2 2012-01-23 3
I felt pressed to write a review...my first one.  This recent upgrade was not an improvement. More cumbersome and less intuitive than the previous incarnation. Still love Kayak, but wish they had left well enough alone.

This app let's u know when your scheduled flight dates have dropped in price, makes it easy to purchase directly from the app. Only wish the flight feature applied to hotels
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-22 5
Works great!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-22 5

I can always find who is offering the best price on flights for my travel needs using KAYAK.  Rental cars are not as easy since most sites have special deals if you click on certain links only from their site.  I did like KAYAK HD better, it was more intuitive and easier to navigate.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-22 5
I've been using this app to plan my travel.  Wow I love it!
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-22 4
It's wonderful. I use it everywhere I go. Planned a trip to Hawaii using this. Awesome 4 stars
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-22 4
Can't update fair alerts which in my opinion is significant.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-22 1
I used to love this app, but, about 4-5 months ago, they did a complete redesign of it which completely destroyed it usefulness. The app works well on the iPad, but on the iPhone, it is  useless. The new "cards" layout (which they seem to have blatantly copied from a competing product by the way) is difficult to read and impossible to quickly scan through your itinerary. Main problems: 1. Your information is compressed into way too small of a space, leaving most of the screen unutilized and making it impossible to really see any detail. 2. If you drill down into a specific item (like hotel for example, again, the same problem. The information is compressed in to a small space and you cannot see all the details (20% of the address runs off the screen for example). 3. No distinctions marking different days in your itinerary; it is just one long list. The dates are given in the details if you look, but again, what happened to scan-ability? 4 - Offline functionality is inconsistent. Normally, it should cache your information from online so you can still access your data when you do not have an internet connection (e.g. on a plane). But, this is hit and miss. Sometimes it works and other times the app just decides it wants to download new data, so it deletes everything currently stored in the cache and tries to go online to get the new info. If there is no connection, well, the cache has already been dumped, so you are out of luck now.

Honestly, this app is now horrible and Kayak either has no interest to fix it or they simply do not listen to their users. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND GO DOWNLOAD TRIPIT INSTEAD. The base service is just as good and the App is far better on the iPhone (about equal for the iPad).

With Kayak HD I never had a problem but with this Kayak app I always get the error message "anonymous access to Kayak API denied". Aka nothing works.

Awesome app! The first time I used it my husband and I got delayed on the Tarmac I knew before the crew made announcements how long we were going to have to wait. When we ended up having to switch planes I knew what was going on. Thank you all so much for this app. Please make it easier for us to update flight info from other itineraries.
Version 21.0.2 2012-01-21 1

Wonderful user interface, but doesn't work when attempting to book with Delta.  Then when I recreate on the Delta site, I can't get the itinerary I want and the price jumped 20% .

There are a lot of travel related apps out there, but Kayak does the job the best!! Quick searches, easy to use interface and the only one that will let you actually BUY your ticket or make your reservation. I have used a lot of other apps that have full websites, Kayak provides all those features in this one app. If you are serious about travel and want to compare prices, flight times, durations as well as hotel and car choices, this is the only app to get!!!

I am constantly getting knocked out of this app on my iPad while searching at car rentals. I don't know if it is my new iPad, the app/Kayak or what but it is extremely annoying.  I get to the pricing page and look at my options and boom - I am back at my main ipad screen.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-15 5

Version 21.0.0 2012-01-15 5
I am so stunned on the simplicity and organization of this app, it has everything you need, Flights, Hotels, and Vehicle Rentals! And it all so simple you can find the cheapest flights, you can even find top quality hotels for under $200 a night
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-15 5
I will never use another travel site again if Kayak can manage to maintain its simple and straightforward interface.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-15 5
I like this app so much I have used it 4 times on my trip in 2 weeks, I recommended it to 2 people leaving my hotel lobby because the rates are sooooo much better and brought them back to the hotel 10 minutes later.
Everyone is pinching their pennies and needs to save time Kayak saves time.... Thank you

Version 21.0.0 2012-01-15 1
I want to like this app, and in fact it works great. However no JetBlue and its the main airline serving my area. No JetBlue flight info at all. Can't give more than one star for this reason.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-15 1
My favorite feature is gone. On flight searches, there used to be a slider for departing times and landing times.  Now you have to choose between crazy early, early morning, late morning and so on.  For example, I need to depart noon or later. I used to put the slider at noon and it displayed ALL flights departing at noon or later.  Now... You have to select the early afternoon timeframe, which shows only flights in that several hour time window. So, for example a 4:30pm flight will not be shown. To make it worse, The time filter will not let you select multiple timeframes to include,say, early afternoon, late afternoon and early evening.  So, you have to manually go in and research each timeframe. Taking away the sliders is a huge step backward and makes this app a no-go for me. I hope the old version will continue to work.  Maybe in the next release, the sliders can be an option.  They were great on the iPad.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-15 4

Would have been an easy 5 stars had it had the sliders.  Kayak, time sliders are what make you more useful that other travel search engines; why remove them??  Now I have to try each travel time window separately, just like Expedia, etc.  Kayak was always the once and done site.  Please bring back the sliders!

The new flight list gives you 500 flights to choose except when you take time to look at them all they seem to really be the same 3 or 4 flights different only by the intermediate stops. A real waste of time and effort compared to the old app.  The slider bar for departure and arrival times was much better than the new check box categories.  Bring back the old app or I'm looking for another service.

Latest upgrade has issues. Can't locate flights for Dec 2012 to St Kitts. No editable field to enter an alternative airport to include in search.  Need to be able to set default or preferred airports for departures.

This app's interface is even more convenient than that on the web site.

Love this app. Can do almost everything you can on the website.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-13 2
This app is a step down from the previous HD app.  It's missing time customization and won't even tell me where stopovers are on multi leg flights.  Disappointing.

Easy to use and listed many options. If you are looking for a cheap flight, use this app.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-13 4
A must-have to shop for travel, but results should be double checked, especially when traveling between "exotic" countries. Cheaper prices might be available on their website, directly.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-13 5
Don't change a thing. Perfect as is.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-13 5
Perfect for finding cheap tickets quickly.  I love that it compares flights from multiple sites.  I also like the ability to search hotels and others travel needs.  The ability to save searches is great too.  I would like to see the iPhone app talk to the iPad app to simplify searches from both devices.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-13 5
This app is beyond what I expected and so easy to use! If you are an expert at scouting out the best fares or inexperienced, this app is perfect! Has a built in price alert system with push notifications for fare updates. It also provides the history for Specific flights!

I miss the slider to set my own arrival and departure time ranges rather than the predefined ranges. Also, Gabe, what about comparing the cost of flying to other modes of transportation-- say Amtrak or BoltBus. That would be especially useful for planning a trip to NYC from Boston.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-13 5
This is probably the best app for making travel plans. Very easy to use.

Version 21.0.0 2012-01-11 5
Not only is this a great app, the customer service is beyond compare. 

In my excitement at the ease of use as compared to other travel apps I've tried, I forgot to put in my hotel reservation dates. As a result, the hotel was booked for the very next day (In NYC). 

I called the company when I realized what I had done, and learned that the reservation was non-refundable because it was for a stay less than 24 hrs away.  I thought I was gonna lose that money for sure. ($350)

But they told me not to worry, they would handle it. They put me on hold, contacted the hotel, and not only did they get my money back, they changed the reservation for me as well. I never even had to talk to the hotel's customer service. They did it all for me. 

If my story doesn't convince you this app is worth getting, then you really never intended to get it in the first place. 

They deserve 10 stars not 5.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-11 4
Sorry to my old one, but this app does it all and even better!

For some reason this app doesn't find the airport, even if I type the title correctly. (ie: Sacramento: SMF, says the airport doesn't exist) so that can be really frustrating to just browse for flights while I have free time and need to.

When I downloaded the app I was already familiar with the game but being able to play when its a down period makes it better. I'm able to play my own music through my I pod. So I'm jamming and buying real estate only in America!!!!!!!! Now I'm on to the game of "Life". Thanks for the great App

The interface looks awesome, it's very accessible and easy to use, but the app crashes after every search. I can get as far as seeing the lowest rate- but if I try to scroll through the list, the app  shuts down. It's like having a huge amazing trampoline with really worn out springs. Jump all you want, this apps got nothin (til the bugs are worked out).

Great to have this app. I'm constantly searching for national and international flights. Very easy to use interface.

One problem: app crashes every time when I search for a flight and then go back to change my dates.

One suggestion (well, two): fix the crashing, and include a feature to send email alerts on particular flights (like you can online)

Thanks!!

Easy to use.  Great app
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-05 5
Very well done. Considering how
dynamic and multifunctional the website is this app proves to be very intuitive and functional. Extras like baggage fees and phone numbers by airline are the icing on the cake.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-05 5
Great app and great website. Kayak is super helpful when it comes to comparing the price of flights. I use this every time I am planning a trip.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-05 5
Best airline flight app I've found by far for searching multiple airlines at once.    Easy to set alerts to send you notices everyday for routes you frequent.

Version 21.0.0 2012-01-04 3
I just did a search for a specific destination and dates. I can't get back to editing my search without force quitting the entire app and restarting. 

The earlier app was much easier to use.

Flawless and useful
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-03 1
Crashes every-time I search for a vehicle rental. Used to love this app. I am very disappointed at the moment and have stopped using it until I receive an update to the app.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-03 4
Great app, a video tutorial on how to setup up iCal on ios devices.
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-03 2
I only gave it 2 stars because I love kayak. This app is totally useless for me.  It seems to choose dates and searches on it's own, and will not let me go back.  Eventually, it just shuts off and crashes every time.  Funny because nobody else is mentioning it, but this is the first app of about 60 that I have had any problems with. Any other iPad users having this issue?
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-03 5
Great app for travel

Finally a game that I can give 5 stars. 
This will keep u going for hrs!!

Version 21.0.0 2012-01-02 4
The app is easy to navigate and provides a lot of options for changing your plans to get a lower price. The only thing I would like to see is a calendar matrix that shows me how the prices change if I go a day forward or backward!
Version 21.0.0 2012-01-02 5

I've been using kayak since someone whispered it to me like it was a secret, and it still seems to be the case. I check it's results against other popular sites and it always either beats them or ties. Great app!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-31 5
Great!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-31 5
I love that I don't have to go the website. I honestly like it better than the website :)
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-31 5
The best part is being able to make reservations on a desktop and then I can pull up my trip information here. I never have to print out conformations again!!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-31 5
Need to find pricing on a flight? This is your app.

I still check all the other travel websites when looking for a flight but kayak always has the cheapest prices and, most importantly, the most comprehensive arch layout!

Like the app and find it intuitive
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-30 4
I prefer this app then the Hotwire app, because this app doesn't require the location service on the iPhone in order to work. Unfortunately I have Sprint and I not always have enough signal for the location service to work, but this app still helped me to find a hotel room on the hills of TN. Easy to use and it works!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-30 5

The best app out there when it comes to searching for flights!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-30 5
As other reviewers have pointed out, the app is really user-friendly and works really well. It is such a good app, that I don't bother turning on my laptop sometimes and just browse flights from my iPhone.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-30 5
...all kinds of brilliant.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-30 5
This app works awesome. Other apps like Travelocity give you a low price but it goes up when you try to book. Not this one!!!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-30 4
This app is so user friendly that I use it now instead of the website.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-30 4
Great app , works way better than the web version
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 2
The previous version of the Kayak mobile app had everything I wanted. Now, I do not have the ability to set or view price alerts, inspite of what technical suppport says. I shall wait for the next update, or I can delete this and restore the prrevious installation from the backup.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 5
Great app easy to use and all of the prices (except Southwest) in one place.  Fantastic!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 5
It's easy to use and I love how you can email travel plans and it's organized. I like this better than tripit. The coolest thing is if you put in your home airport it shows a picture of the world and how much airfares are!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 4
WHY ARE THERE NOT JET BLUE FLIGHTS TO FORT MYERS NOT LISTED
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 4
Always use Kayak online to shop for best deals and the app is actually easier to use imo
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 4
One really annoying feature that they are lacking is a true type ahead for airports. For instance I need to know to type Bridgetown or Grantly Adams instead of Barbados. I personally would like to see consistency with their website where it is smart enough to point me to an airport by typing in the abbreviation, city or country name. After all the whole point of this is so you don't have to leave the app to look something up.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 5
Very good website.  Nice design too.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 4
Title says it all!! :)
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 5
Great app.. This one should be an example of how apps should be. Super user friendly and super functional.. Thanks to the app designers at kayak.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 1
This app would be amazing if the prices reflected the online prices for the airlines.   The price on the app is a lot higher!  Why?
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 4
Just updated today, and the new version has some bugs. Specifically, I keep getting booted out when I try to filter my flight search results. (like when I try to deselect certain days or slide the arrival time bar). 

However, it has been a great app. Wish that this app included all the same search options as the website, like date flexibility, custom multi-airport searches, and so on. Solid performer, mostly.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 5
Good app! Nice!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 5
Fun, easy to use, amazing!!

Easier to find flights than my American United or Southwest apps (which i stopped using). You can filter flights and email to friends.  I love it.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-29 5
Fantastically useful app.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 5
This is, by far, the best travel app. Every aspect was well thought out, programmed, and smart. I love the flight tracker option. Highly recommend for anyone!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 5
The best travel app going!!!!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 5
I love the new feature that sends results by email. And the flight tracker is free!
Version 19.0.0 2011-12-28 5
Kayak is an incredibly useful website that allows you to search for flights, hotels, cars, and virtually any other travel reservations you may need.  I recommend you you use the website before you use the app.

The app gives you basic access to the website.  It is the kind of app that I continually delete and re-install: every couple of months I clean out my applications and think to myself, why in the world do I need an app to look-up and book travel?  Then, inevitably, a couple of weeks later I find myself re-installing the app because I need it.  If you ever need to book (or re-book) travel on the road, or just get a quick price check on travel, this is the app to get.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 3
Crashes during flight search.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 5
It's rather better then those travel apps that cost 2 dollars. Would recommend to stick to this app and not waste your money.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 5
Works great for finding & notifying you of cheap/affordable flight tickets. I'm always saving $ with it.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 5
Great Application. Easy to use and a saving program for the user. A+++++
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 5
Have been using kayak since 2006 and always worked for me. I'm actually surprised the airlines haven't managed to kill its business model as they almost did with Priceline. In any case, this app brings all the pros and none of the cons of the website to a little device called the iPhone. I enjoy it!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 5
Great user interface, fun to use.....better than their website
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 4

Great app to keep track of travel reservations: flights, hotel and rental car.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-28 5

Works nicely, but I only get Euro prices. Can't change currencies!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-27 3
It does what you need nothing amazing but it needs to show flight prices more accurately instead of detouring to the providers site.

Version 21.0.0 2011-12-27 5

This is definitely my favorite travel app- I appreciate not only the flight search feature, but also the packing list and currency converter.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-26 1
Needed a car from Cincinnati to chicago, kayak only receives rental car prices on same city returns even though it makes you think otherwise. Ended up costing me 208 $ I'm not so happy, they need to fix this
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-26 5
I use frequently and love it!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-26 1
I installed the iPhone version on my ipad because it has more features than the iPad version ie price change notifications. Now that it's a universal app, I've lost those features. 

Make both versions the same!
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-26 5
Absolutely great. Good deals.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-26 3
Took forever to download my trip itenerary.  Won't let me change my trip name. There's a box to type in but the cursor doesn't start blinking when you tap inside it to type. Review will change to higher rating when fixed.
Version 21.0.0 2011-12-26 5
A perfect app. Probably my favorite. Too bad.

Version 21.0.0 2011-12-26 2
It "was" a great app until this came up... My iPad was connected, yet I could not change the destination nor did I have an option of disconnecting to again connect. Resolve this issue to get a 5 star rating...

Version 21.0.0 2011-12-25 1
Kayak is a great service and this app is flawless except for one "little"thing. I'm  only giving them 1 star in hopes that this brings some attention to their poor judgement in featuring Vayama in their search results.
Vayama is a terrible company and their customer service leaves a whole lot to be desired! 
There's absolutely no excuse in this day and age to have to wait 24 hours to find out if they were able to book your flight or not. I've lost precious time and money dealing with this sham of a company. I will happily change my rating for this app when Vayana gets dropped from Kayak, but until then no soup for you!

So easy to use!!!
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-20 1
I am deleting this app based on your company's decision to cave to anti-Arab propaganda from a crazy un-American fringe groups attack on a television show that depicts real Arab americans. Living and striving to live the American dream. Your app is the best travel app of all I have tried on the app store but you spinelessness and un-American actions mean for me I can not support your company or service.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-20 5
Saves time
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-20 5
This app does everything you'd expect it to -- and even throws in a bunch of extras!

Version 19.0.6 2011-12-18 1
Very slow and takes too long to load, ends up freezing my phone.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-18 5
It has all the information I need to plan a good trip, even airline baggage fees. How cool is that?
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-18 1
The ap was barely OK.  Would probably continue to use it, but the company took marketing direction from a racist, fundamentalist organization.  Kayak sided with racist - I am taking my business elsewhere.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-18 5
Very detailed
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-18 1
We'll never deal with them again

I am deeply disappointed to learn that Kayak has shown its bigotry and cowardice by refusing to advertise on a non christian tv show and yet they sell flights on airlines based in islamic countries like gulf and turkish air  I encourage everyone to boycott this bigoted hateful company

If you travel many times during the year and don't want to deal with travel agency kayak is your best friend. Tickets are about $200 cheaper compare to most travel agency and it's all at your fingertip.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-17 5

A very complete app. No need of downloading anything else.

The app is super easy to use & navigate through. I live the site & I love this app
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
Removed app because of kayak's poor decision to pull advertising from "All-American Muslims"
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 5
Helpful and handy!!!
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
For a company focused on travel, you'd think they would be more, oh I don't know, global-minded? To be clear: kayak.com removed ads from a TV show that dared to portray Muslim-Americans as normal, dignified humans because a group of evangelical Christians from Florida complained. 

App deleted.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
Bigotry will not be tolerated. I'll use another company from here on out.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
I can't respect a company that doesn't respect religious freedom.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 5
Convenient and beautiful!
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
I deleted this app due to the bigoted actions of this company. I hope everyone else does the same.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 5
Perfecto
Version 19.0.1 2011-12-15 1
There's no room for religious prejudice on my iPhone.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
I used to use this site for a long time but from now on. I would never use it or buy anything because you pulled your ads from all American Muslims. Deleted the app now.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
I used to like this app.  Later Kayak!
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 5
This is my favorite go to travel app.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
I removed because they made a poor choice. Bigotry is not good business.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
I liked the app, but when you pulled your advertising from TLC's "American Muslim", I am pulling my use of Kayak.  I'm sorry you are bigoted.
Version 19.0.6 2011-12-15 1
Bigots. Uninstalled because you pulled your ads from the TLC show... You know which one.

This app is amazing. It is incredibly versatile. I'm live tracking my gfs flight right now so I can get to the airport on time. It is incredibly useful whether you are the one flying or not. Even if you travel once a year, this app should be on your iPhone.

Version 19.0.5 2011-11-27 5
Great app. Works wonderfully. The website on ur apple device. 

Also, for a great way to earn free gift cards, download 'App Trailers', use bonus code "aphr0w" ( the '0' is a zero and not an 'o') and get ur points and then redeem ur gift card of choice!!  I just got a $10 iTunes card. This is not a scam

It allows you to filter your search by different factors. It's good showing the best deals, but I have found better deals on the Airline's website.
Version 19.0.3 2011-11-03 1
This app has 4400 reviews but about forty are real people the rest are the developers making fake comments about the program you should be ashamed but I know your not instead of working to improve the app you just waste time making a bad program look better than it is people will just delete it once they install it shame on you shame....!

Version 19.0.1 2011-10-23 5
this app is great i use it all the time but it would be nice to have under filter a way to choose an airline alliance so only flights within your alliance will pop up.

Version 19.0.3 2011-10-08 2
So far I've been on this for 10 minutes and it crashed three times and takes a long time to load the results. Once it said no results matches my search, then I searched again and it popped it hundreds.

I love this app. You just forward your confirmation email to an e-mail address, and it sorts everything out and then keeps all the info you need while traveling in one convenient place, and sends you reminder e-mails when you need them, without making it feel like spam.
Version 19.0.3 2011-10-06 5

My Mother in law recommended this app and I am so glad that I got it! We are planning a trip to Hawaii and I hope this app will help us even more! Totally recommend this! I especially like how it gives you what orbitz or another company's prices on hotels. Vey useful. Get it!
Version 19.0.3 2011-10-06 5
Love the price alert features, which alert you when a fare drops to a certain price point, or gives you a list of the cheapest flights to or from a certain location. Best app for finding last minute cheap flights. Highly recommended.
Version 19.0.0 2011-10-05 1
Tried the app out. Tried booking a room and all I got were error messages. So I went to another hotel, directly booking. I get an email confirmation a day later after the app gave me error messages..

Called Kayak and they refused to refund charges. Said they couldn't because the email was sent. EVEN though it was nearly 24 hours later. 

Such crap. Take your business elsewhere!
Version 19.0.3 2011-10-05 1
This app is horrible. I couldn't find any of my flight information and when I finally did it was the wrong information. That's what I get from a free app. DON'T GET THIS APP!!!!! Big waist of time.
Version 19.0.3 2011-10-05 4
Great app! Easy to use and fast. Wish it would have more options found on the full site. (advanced search options, more options for flexible schedules).

Now "features" ads embedded as choices.  Markedly less useful now.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-27 5
So easy to use and my favorite feature is the awesome flight status updates. They are so on the mark...better than airline attendants!
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-27 5
Just like it's webiste, this is an excellent and useful App to have. In fact it is easier to use than the website. I am looking forward to getting the iPad version when it comes out.

I highly recommend it for anybody that travels, whether occasionally or a lot.
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-27 5
I haven't used all the features of this app yet, but it has an awesome flight tracker build right in. I'm going to be using this for flight lookups in the future, too.

If you're looking for a mobile flight tracker, or want to research flight prices on the go, definitely get this app.
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-27 5
Great app!!  Find anything your looking for

Version 19.0.3 2011-09-21 3
Lots of options in results for both flight and hotel and super easy to use! But no hotel and flight package options AND the app suddenly closes for no reason and I have to restart the app and search process. Very annoying!
Version 19.0.3 2011-09-21 5
It's very easy to use!!!!!!
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-21 2
Multi tasking doesn't work very well
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-20 3
Why can't I add my own flight information? I add information you give push notification. It's really simple. I don't want to send you an email. I don't need one more cyber paper trail of my activities.  Allow me to put in airline and flight number. You already have the time. C'mon, it's 2011, catch up.
Version 19.0.3 2011-09-20 5

What was up with that update that changed the My Trips??? You've now severely handicapped it!  It used to be so great!  A nice layout, links to maps, info about the hotels and airport... Now it's just crap!  Please revert back to the old My Trips and I'll rerate with 5 stars but in the meantime, i'll switch to Trip It.
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-19 4

Version 19.0.2 2011-09-17 5
I travel a lot and was wishing for kayak app to be at my disposal to get an idea about tickets. This app just came in time and now I am a regular user. Very interesting UI design by app engineers. Definitely a hit.

After searching several sites for cross-country airfares, I put Kayak on my iPhone just to see how it compared. Kayak found the cheapest flight, & with min flight changes & layovers, so I booked the ticket on the spot...all from my iphone while relaxing on the lanai. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-16 5
Handy and easy to use- great features!!

Version 19.0.2 2011-09-08 5
The best and easiest travel App. I like the fact that you get pinged for gate changes and which luggage carousel your bags will be.
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-08 5
I love this app!! It is definitely easy to use to look up on airfares, car rental, hotel, and what not. Definitely worth downloading
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-08 4

Kayak is an amazing app for all your travel needs. It even helps you book international flights ! Amazing app !
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-08 5
This my go to app when lookin for a flight. Usually find good deals and I like that the developers are constantly sending out updates for bugs.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-08 5
Best travel tool ever!!

I always find the best deal for rental cars and flights via Kayak.
Version 19.0.2 2011-09-08 5
This app rocks. It beats the airline apps by hundreds of dollars on tickets.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-08 5
Excellent- saves money
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-08 5
Great app
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-08 3
If you want to know what hotels are in a certain area, then yay- you'll have a lot to choose from, but after that it gets dicey. The prices aren't that great (or even accurate, when you get to the actual booking stage), it lists a lot of B&B's that you have to either call or email for rates (if I wanted to spend time hunting them down I'd have done it before I left town) and some of the descriptions of the nearby attractions aren't close to being accurate. I don't know who writes those, so it may not be fair to penalize Kayak for that, but I don't consider an attraction 2.5 miles away from my hotel to be "walking distance", particularly in the summertime.  The app is easy to use- too bad the info's not more reliable.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-07 5
Fast and efficient ... Finally a travel app that does what it's supposed to do.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-05 5
Great app.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-05 5
I've switched over to Kayak on my iPhone. No regrets. Everything needed for making easy reservations. Streamlined look to the app instead of clutter helps when needing access to information in a hurry.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-05 5
The app is professionally put together, responsive, and useful(best of all)
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-04 5
Love this app
Version 18.0.0 2011-09-04 5

Version 19.0.0 2011-09-04 5
Very clean and easy to use. Well done, kayak!
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-04 5
I was able to quickly find a hotel when and where I needed to.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-04 5
This app it really good no need to go to a website
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-04 5
Amazing job well done on this app. Give your Information Architect, design, dev, and PM teams responsible for this a hardy handshake for me. One of the best apps I've used on iOS. Certainly great enough to get this wallflower to sing praise.

I have to admit I'm more of an Expedia fan on the web. Or rather 'was'. I'm a big fan of things that are well designed - this app just turned me into a Kayak'r.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-03 5
It works
Version 19.0.0 2011-09-03 5
Very good app!
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-03 5
It does it all really well
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-03 5
Awesome saving!!
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-03 5
Great great app! I hate booking trips and this app makes it so easy!
Version 19.0.0 2011-09-03 5
Has all the features and options I need.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-03 5
This app out does any similar app for accessibility Makes the whole trip easier.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-03 5
This App is great!!!
Version 19.0.0 2011-09-02 5

Very,very good
Version 18.0.0 2011-09-02 5
Great app! I had an emergency and had to get a ticket for overseas asap and this app saved the day and saved me a whole lot of $$$
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-02 5
This is an amazing app. If it would cost 5 bucks would still be worth it. Keep up the great work.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-02 5
Filters work great and the app is easy to use!
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-02 5
You don't have to have all the answers:  you just have to know where to find them. Kayak helps you get answers to your travel questions.
Version 19.0.0 2011-09-01 5
Simple.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-01 4
Great for booking flights, hotels and anything else. The current version does not find my flight in the tracker (5 star if this is fixed)
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-01 4
Like the price alerts
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-01 5
Simply the best.  The only downside is that I have to use the mobile site (even at my desk) to follow a flight.  Otherwise the flight tracking is better than my own airline's on-line reservation site!!
Version 19.0.0 2011-09-01 5
This is the best travel app I've ever used. Found and booked a hotel in another country in minutes. Also found the absolute best deal for this hotel in a matter of min. Kayak knows what's up for the busy no-nonsense type that wants the best deal.
Version 19.0.0 2011-09-01 5
A little less customizable than the full kayak website, but it has notifications for low fare alerts without the need to register.
Version 18.0.0 2011-09-01 5
Kayak is the best travel site/ap available.
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-01 5
Very nice and handy tool
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-01 5
Great website, great service, even awesomer app!
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-01 5
I could not believe that Kayak was able to find particular round trip for 1300 USD while Delta's web site was giving me 1800 USD for same dates, same origination, same destination!
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-01 5
Hands down best flight tracker software ive seen in an app
Version 19.0.1 2011-09-01 5

I will keep this short and sweet. If you travel, you need this App! I've book two trips and have save hundreds.
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-30 5
Finally, a travel app that makes sense and you actually can use!
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-30 5
The use of this app is clean and smooth. Excellent high quality photos of each hotel. I am not much of a review reader when it comes to hotels but I found some very helpful feedback. Now I know where not to go for the holidays. Thanks Kayak.
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-30 5
Great app! Could be improved as searched results are lost when trip details are viewed.. But definitely a great tool!
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-30 5
Wow!
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-30 5
It's been 3 days since I began using this app for flight tickets/price checks and I've to say that I find the app better than the website :)

Fantastic app. Easy to use, and I have booked 2 trips on it already. Love the tracker for flights.
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-29 5
Best travel deals app for me. App is easier to use than the website itself!
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-29 4
Well its alright with me
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-29 4
Easy to use.... Good deals..
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-29 4
This is a great ap, but if you search a flight for 2 or more passengers, the price you are shown is for 1 passenger. Why don't they total the cost? This is also the case for a hotel stay that is for more than 1 night. If you get a hotel quote for 10 nights, it doesn't quote the total. It only displays the price per night.
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-28 4
Solid.
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-28 5
This is my favorite travel app.
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-28 5
Saves you money and time rather than searching all te other sites
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-28 5
I think kayak.com is the best place to book travel on the web. I was amazed that the app was even easier to use.  Good work kayak!!!
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-28 4
Fantastic

Handy app, fast and easy
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-27 2
This aps is not working for flight tracking. They never update the flight information. Just as an example this weekend the flight was cancelled and this aps still shows time of arrival, basically it gives the wrong information
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-27 5
Very useful.
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-27 5
Quick & easy to use.  When my flight got delayed I was able to tell the gate agent what other flights were available faster than he could!
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-24 5
It finds what you want, regardless of the route you want to fly on. It's pretty neat!!
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-24 5
Kayak is the best travel planning app around.
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-24 5
This has always been my fave flight booking app on my iPhone. Only 2 things I wish they'd add back that I loved from older version was the (1) "Prefer Non-Stop" right on the flight search page and (2) the older home page look that had the icon squares setup to choose your search type etc. Kind of like home page of iPhone where you could rearrange them & scroll left/right between pages. I know that's a few versions back but I can't stop wishing they'd kept those options. Oh well. Still my fave nonetheless. Keep rockin it Kayak :)
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-24 5

I don't even think about traveling without checking into Kayak, and this app is sweet: fully functional, quick & easy!!
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-21 5
I've tried all the travel apps.  Two stand out.  Expedia and Kayak.

Expedia is good but does't seem to have all the hotels/motels listed.

Kayak not only seems to have a larger database for hotels/motels, it does so much more.  Add to that a map function that leaves the rest in the dust.

The flight functions are great and work better than expected.

All in all, a very great app.  If it wasn't free, it would be worth at least a $9.95 investment.

Definitely a 5 star +.
Version 19.0.0 2011-08-21 5
I love to travel and kayak makes sure I get to do it at the best price without wasting time searching every travel site on the Internet.

Version 2.2 2011-08-15 3
Excellent app, long time user. Was not happy with the new version update to My Trips. I cannot view my trips without a data/wi-fi connection which is not always possible when traveling internationally and that is the time when I need to see my itinerary the most. Will give 5 stars if this goes back to how it was earlier.

This is the easiest and by far most efficient app out there for anyone who travels!
Version 18.0.0 2011-08-05 5
Kayak's newest interface is great & so easy to use that I prefer this app to "regular" laptop or desktop applications.
Version 18.0.0 2011-08-05 5
I love kayak!
Version 18.0.0 2011-08-05 4
Good interface but a little busy. Overall, the map and search functions are great though.
Version 18.0.0 2011-08-05 5
Works and it works well
Version 18.0.0 2011-08-05 4
This is a great app, but Southwest Airlines' actual website showed me better rate than what Kayak said Southwest Airlines' rate was. In other words, all the other airlines are appear to be accurate, but Southwest prices were quoted higher than actual site.
Version 18.0.0 2011-08-04 5
I've compared, and have switched to kayak for repeatingly finding me the best deal.  And the site is well laid out, easy to use, and fast!

Version 14.0.1 2011-08-03 5
To summarize, one of the only apps out there that works BETTER than the full website!

I think this Kayak app is fantastic. This is the only app I use for travel discounts. Thanks.
Version 18.0.0 2011-08-02 4
For the most part this app finds the best prices around but I have found better prices on carrier's websites before. A great addition would be some sort of filter for each leg of a journey so it would be easier to control your route. Overall this app is my "go to" for finding baseline pricing for air travel.
Version 14.0.1 2011-08-02 5
Great app, Great flights and easy navigation.

Phenomenal app. Super fast results. Nearly reads my mind. Love it!!
Version 18.0.0 2011-07-26 1
Prices you see from the iPhone kayak app always are more than if you use a computer. So, since kayak is not honest about this, I give kayak a generous 1 star.
Version 18.0.0 2011-07-26 5

Nice and useful app. Doesn't update the currency when you change it from settings. Might want to look into that though.

Great ap. Easy to use
Version 18.0.0 2011-07-24 4
This is a great app. It has a broad and powerful search engine. 

The one thing I have found this to be missing is adding the layover limiter feature. You can find the perfect flight at the perfect price, except if the layover is 9 hours. So a layover limiter parameter would be helpful. Integrate this into the push alert feature and you've got a 5-star app.
Version 18.0.0 2011-07-24 5
It just works. Intuitive, easy to use and better than the next guy. It just works!!

I've been using this app to set up a trip to Paris for this September. Searching for a flight and booking it was soo super easy. The packing list and currency converter are just the icing on the cake. I would've given it a five-star rating, but I haven't left yet :)

Awesome.
Version 18.0.0 2011-07-10 4
I am using it as a trip planner/organizer more than anything, but I am amazed at how helpful this is! I did do a hotel search with it, but I ended up booking directly through the chain's site by choice. Prices were accurate, though, and VERY helpful.

The currency converter, airport info, airline fees, airline directory and checklists are a great addition. The ability to email your confirmations in is simply amazing and works very well. All of them were recognized (even my Amtrak connection) and automatically added to My Trips with an extremely high degree of accuracy. Even if there are a few errors, you can simply log in to the website quickly and fix them. But that brings me to the reason why I took away a star from a full 5 - you cannot currently edit or delete any of the My Trips entries from the app. I used the in-app contact form to ask, and they confirmed this (within 30 minutes of my asking early on a Saturday, BTW! Wow!). You must do it from the website. If they add this in the future, I will definitely give it a full 5. I might even consider buying the paid version to get rid of the ads! :)
Version 18.0.0 2011-07-10 5
Yep

Does exactly what I need it to!
Version 18.0.0 2011-07-03 2
I can't even imagine what people are raving about with this app.  Search results return prices for hotels - but when drilling down on a specific hotel, it gives a significantly higher price than is reflected in the results list for at least 30-40% of the locations. (and, no... I don't mean the slightly higher price that reflects fees/taxes).  Plus it has crashed when viewing maps & pics within the app on my iPad.
Version 18.0.0 2011-07-03 4
Does everything the website does (and doesn't). Good app for quick travel prices and info. Don't know if I'd buy tickets on my phone though

The actual website shows the cheaper flights. The app showed flights that were $100 more. Looks like they're trying to rip the app users off to me.
Version 18.0.0 2011-07-01 5

Version 18.0.0 2011-06-30 5
The program is far more as
accurate than the SYNC I have in my 2010 Lincoln MKT. The voice is 
much more clear than the SYNC voice also.

It is very intuitive as it picks up a wrong turn and gets you back on course where SYNC keeps turning you to get on it's suggested route

Wish I could find a method to make speech louder so I could use In our 1956 Studebaker and 1990 Reatta convertible

I really wish they would fix the bugs in it. Awesome app. But constantly reopening the app
Version 18.0.0 2011-06-15 1
It would be very helpful to be able to enter a city as a destination and get a list of airport choices, especially those close but in a different city or state. Also, if you use this app several times, say 3-6, without resetting phone, it crashes.
Version 18.0.0 2011-06-15 1
It keeps foreclosing while searching. Uninstalled & reinstalled & still doing it.
Version 18.0.0 2011-06-14 4

Besides the couple times where Southwest was cheaper or it took me off the app, it was great.
Version 18.0.0 2011-06-14 1
Would be great if I didn't have to open it five times to complete ONE search.

This app puts almost every travel website to shame. I'm a spur of the moment type of person and I love being able to quickly see how much a trip to see family or friends cost. I wish it was easier to buy tickets in the app but I understand that's an airline thing rather than an app problem. (AIrlines have yet to understand that the easier it is to buy, the more you sell).
Version 18.0.0 2011-06-13 5
Wonderful app

This app is simple, but you can do a lot with it. In fact, I may prefer its format to that of the website!

Kayak has turned into my travel app and site of choice. I actually prefer the IPad experience the best because of the map where you can just see the available low fares from around the world. Makes me want to travel more! 

The interface is intuitive and so easy to use. I definitely still check out other sites for comparison but Kayak has not  disappointed me yet!
Version 18.0.0 2011-06-04 1
Lotsa rave reviews but budget airlines eg airasia seem to be taken out of the queries. I can save thousands by doing my own manual look up search. Very disappointed. Include the budget and small airlines and I will give 5 stars.

Version 18.0.0 2011-06-01 1

This is the #BEST travel app EVER.
1. I get alerts regd which terminal the connecting flight leaves from. 
2. The best alert I received was regd flight cancellation that even the Airline did not bother to send. Thanks to Kayak, I had enough time to call the airline and take a different connection. 

Request: add a parking reminder and there's no need for using any airline app !!!

Kayak rocks !!!

I think this app would be great, but it crashes on each use. When you get back in, it doesn't remember your filter.  Very frustrating! I wonder is Kayak Pro works better?

Version 18.0.0 2011-05-13 4
Easy to navigate. I've found it fairly easy to book reservations if you get sent to the main clearinghouses (Expedia, etc.) but a little more cumbersome if you get connected with the hotel directly. :-/
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-13 4

Works good. But missing southwest.
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-12 5
The app is so easy to use. I move fast because I'm loaded with kids and own a company. Time is money for me, so efficiency is a premium features when I choose my mobile tools. Kayak's updates and load times are always stellar. I also downloaded their flight tracker app which has saved me time when flights I'm booked for run late. My fave story...found a 3 day advance purchase roundtrip LAX to Paris for $600. Spent Thanksgiving in Europe. Love it!!
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-12 5
It's really usefull for people who want to find good prices.

Much easier than getting out at 5 motels and comparing prices.
Version 11.0.0.0 2011-05-12 5
Works great. It would be nice to have a calendar view to determine what dates are cheapest, but the app is still great as is.
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-12 5
This app is a MUST for all travelers whether you travel one time or 12 times a year.

Version 18.0.0 2011-05-10 3
Like the app - search worked great, but wasn't able to book through the app - it froze on final submission of info. Luckily, was close to the hotel and booked directly.
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-10 5
This is by far the easiest travel app to use.
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-10 5
Super fast and convenient. The app makes it easy to switch from RT to multi-city trips. It also remembers your last search and includes great filters so you see only the results you need. 

I now use this as a first stop for all flight searches. Super handy. (Haven't yet tried for options other than flights, e.g., hotels, cars, etc.)
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-10 5

Version 18.0.0 2011-05-10 5
I usually don't bother writing a review. I find most people uptight,pretentious, or idiots that do. But I have to say this is the best free travel/flight app out there. For all that travel or just like finding great deals on flights download this app.

Version 18.0.0 2011-05-07 5
I travel often; about four or five times a year, and I love this app! It really helps with booking and finding flights on the go! My only suggestion is to take into account unaccompanied minors occasionally need to pay extra fees, so it would be nice to show how much that would cost for each individual airline. Otherwise, great app!
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-07 5
Seriously, everything you could possibly need for traveling.

I've been searching for a cheap flight to my girlfriend's country and it's a good search tool. Nothing out of the usual and no incredible deals yet, but probably out of kayak's hands. Mostly I just wanted to write my first review as a new iPhone owner. I wonder where you, yes YOU are reading this from right now. What a world - don't take a moment for granted and good luck with tomorrow's goals.

Hands down my favorite travel app. It is powerful and yet simple, with innovative features that wowed me and made me think, "Why didn't any of the other apps think of that?" Other apps (and websites!) should have to study this app.

This one app just replaced three other apps on my phone. Gate and terminal information is available. Kayak also offers a service to registered users that allows you to see all you travel itineraries inside this app. Great job to the architects at Kayak.com!
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-03 5
So easy to use!  Better interface than discount travel websites!
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-03 5

Version 18.0.0 2011-05-01 5
Just finished a multi-city car trip, with hotel stays in multiple locations.  Kayak helped with reservations, and the ease of adding the itinerary just by forwarding confirmation emails is awesome.  Had used the flight tracker earlier, which was spot on for flights at CVG.  Definitely upgrading!
Version 18.0.0 2011-05-01 5
I live this app! So glad there is finally an easy, quick Way to search and book flights. I'll do all of my flight shopping with Kayak from now on.

It's a good app to look up travel info, when it doesn't crash every 5 minutes!

Much easier to search and book flights with this app. Airline specific apps do not do search well
Version 18.0.0 2011-04-20 3
Found great deals quickly, although the form to fill in info when purchasing is a little tricky to navigate. Larger font & optimization on those screens would make it ideal!
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-20 4
Its a great app and seems to be as helpful as the real page. However, I wish that there was an option to put together whole vacation packages
Version 18.0.0 2011-04-20 5

Seems to do the same thing as the paid version. No annoying ads. Fast searches, lots of places to choose from. I wish there was a way to look at different room upgrades within the same hotel! But so far it's the best I've found.

I love this app, just wish that it would give the actual total, not by night for hotels. Ex: 8/12-8/14 the total amount for 2 nights not just per night. I love how easy everything was to plan!!! Vegas and Denver here I come!!
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-13 4
Love the notifications!
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-12 5
Loved the website, loving the app more!
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-12 4
This app does what it says it will do and well. Smooth interface, good clear graphics and speed, and it has become my go to for checking rates and options.
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-12 5
Everything worked better than expected. Way easy to send a copy of e-mail flight confirmation and them be hood to go. I was surprised to not only receive check in reminders, but up to the minute flight updates about as fast as they happened. Nice to know what gate to go to and be informed of any changes or delays. Much better than the airline's app.
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-12 4
Not bad
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-12 5
Finding all the travel needs in one go !!!

Love it
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-12 2
This app is excellent, except that some airlines are suspiciously absent from search results, such as JetBlue, and it  crashes pretty frequently. I expect that a bug name app like this would return fares for ALL airlines and be rock solid stable. Apparently my expectations are outlandishly high after several updates.
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-12 5
Great!!!!!
Version 17.0.3 2011-04-12 5
Really helpful for all my trips :)

It's time companies take note that iPhone users do notice when they put time into their apps. This is an awesome app way easier than using kayak.com in safari. Well done Kayak.
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-11 5
I love Kayak.com and am pleased that the app works as smoothly as the website.
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-11 5
Just what I needed and perfect for keeping on top of all my travel!
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-10 5
Very easy to use, in some aspects even better than the website.
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-10 4
Very useful for airline-ticket's price and availability checking. I wish you could book (purchase) airline tickets right from the app's result - because you have to enter same info again on your computer inorder to confirm/book. And sometimes, those low fares which you find on this app... are far gone or doesn't exist anymore :(
Version 17.0.1. 2011-04-10 5

Fantastic!! I can search for ALL my travel needs in one great site. I have used the Kayak website for about 5 years now and it has been great. But the Kayak app is far better!!! The app is the simplest, quickest way for me find a flight and book it in only a matter of minutes. While sitting in the airport I am able to check flight status and even baggage claim area. Even if I had to pay for the app I would do so. Great app!
Version 17.0.4 2011-04-01 5
On the Go!!

Built to serve travelers, not one particular company's agenda.  Refers you to the right place.  Settings and filters are so easy to adjust - I wish other apps adopted their designs - easy to use and always right on when I've double checked things with other websites.  Thank you for such a great app and website.

When looking at a list of hotels it shows their prices, but when looking at a map of the same hotels it says you need to call to get a quote, while it us the same hotel that was in tye list, this was unhelpful un finding a deal, but was very helpful for finding locations!

Nice & easy-to-use UI
Version 17.0.4 2011-03-28 5
Does what I needed and them some. Was happy to have the app to quickly check on flights to get a sense of what cost will be of flights. 

Also has lots of helpful little extras, like a guide to how much each airline charges for baggage check! Very handy to know if flight times are flexible and prices close. A reminder that the more expensive flight won't charge for baggage check can save me that much more money.
Version 17.0.4 2011-03-28 5
Great app! Definitely saves me money and time.

Kayak is a very useful app
Version 17.0.4 2011-03-26 5
I think this is the best travel app out there. But, unfortunately it missing some features that make me keep around a bunch of other apps. I want to be able to build travel plans ( add hotels, cars, etc). And why can't I get a discount for flight and car?  There is not "what's near here" feature and no streetview. Beef this app up so I don't have to visit 4 different apps to plan my trips!!!  I'd upgrade to pro for that
Version 17.0.3 2011-03-26 5
Use it to book international flights and I always get great recommendations always!!!

Didn't really think I'd use it much since most of my travel is arranged through my admin department.  But only days later I found myself breaking it out and finding a good deal.  The layout is perfect, showing all the airlines' prices along with departure times and trip lengths.  This is one app I know I'll be keeping.

This is a great app that I find to be easy and quick to use. It does the work of comparing different airlines. I also love the itinerary feature. I just forwarded the email confirmations from my airline, hotel and car reservations to kayak and it automatically collects and collates them into a concise itinerary.
Version 17.0.3 2011-03-13 5
The best travel app out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've used Kayak for years and now the iPhone app makes it easy to make those quick checks on travel. So when you're sitting having dinner with friends you can talk real dates and numbers when dreaming about that next trip to Scotland, or if you're taking that last minute trip to follow that band because Craigslist had some awesome tickets you can check and book that hotel from the freeway!  It's still a little awkward in it's transitions to other sites and a few other things but all-in-all it works great and is a wonderful convenience. Keep up the good work!

Version 17.0.3 2011-02-23 4
Brilliant app. At the moment 1 of my top 5. It includes lots of helpful travel tools which i havent had the chance to try yet. I have used the flight ticket tool though. Quick and easy way to check for flight price changes. I would like an easier way to purchase the tickets via app but i don't think Kayak has power over that. It would be nice if there was a landscape view for everything. So far so good!

Version 17.0.3 2011-02-19 4
Love using kayak's website and then having an app makes them even better to me! I gave it a 4 only because I haven't used all the features of it to rate it completely.
Version 17.0.3 2011-02-19 5
My main usage has been the flight tracker so far. I like it because flight information is not lost when switching to another application making it easy to recheck flight status during the flight without re-entering data. It is also very easy to "Pull up" the correct airline and flight numbers.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-18 5
I was excited to discover Kayak online five years ago...now it's my #1 resource for travel research and booking. I got the app just as another option for access, but after one use, i now prefer the app over online. And you will too. The user interface is so much better!
Version 17.0.3 2011-02-18 4
Good app. Easy to use.
Version 17.0.3 2011-02-18 5

I prefer using the Kayak app on my phone than on the computer. I just might end up booking more flights with this app because it's such a breeze to use.

I am a frequent flyer and this app does just about everything possible to help keep you organized. Easy to use.

Version 17.0.3 2011-02-16 5
Kayak covers all of the bases.  The software seems to find flights that other travel sites can't.  I love the updated baggage fee cost per airline tab.  Kayak is the most versatile flight finder app I've seen.
Version 17.0.3 2011-02-16 4
Great App! Does it exactly what it says. Gotta love when that happens.

This is the most accurate, complete, and user friendly app I have seen for costing of flights, hotels, and cars. Not much more to say.
Version 17.0.3 2011-02-15 5
My favorite feature is the integration with the website's trips feature. It allows me to forward travel itineraries emails form hotels, airlines and hotels and access them from the phone and with a single click also get flight tracking info for flights. 

...and it is great for finding low price fares that are actually available.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-15 5

Decent app but I don't see the need for the option to select multiple passengers if the pricing shown is always the price for one passenger.
Version 17.0.3 2011-02-15 5
Great app!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-15 5
For someone always on the go.. This is the greatest app ever

Everything about this app is great. The only thing I wish kayak had was a prediction aspect to lets you know if mow is the best time to buy, similar to farecast.

Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-10 5
We're planning a trip to Hawaii and this is the best app for that. It tells us what hotels are nice and reasonably priced and what flights we can take. So I can make an estimate of about how much this trip will cost. U NEED THIS APP!!
Version 14.0.5 2011-02-10 5
Great
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-10 4

Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-10 5
Great design and super easy to use
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-10 5
I love the fact that it gave me so many choices on airlines and all the flights going out. The others just gave me the first couple. I'll be using this app every time I travel!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-10 5
So far this app has been great with me planing trips
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 5
great app for anyone who travels. im not much of a flyer so i rarely use it to book flights but it works like a charm when it comes to finding and booking a hotel weeks in advance. And on top of that its free...what more can u ask for?
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 1
Don't DL it. It's a waste of time.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 5
Awesome app. Very easy to use perfect for booking things on-the-go.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 1
The flight pricing is hardly accurate.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 5
Yeah it's good...    Simple and useful.  Can't beat it.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 4
Love it! Very usefull.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 5
I love it. I'm able to search what kind of hotels are available at that time with having to get my laptop. It's just so handy. I recommend using it. Thanks for reading! Get it! Use it! Love it!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 5
This app does exactly what it promises. Awesome interface.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 4
It's everything you need to make travel arrangements in one app. It's really great.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-09 4
I used it to search for flights and think its a great app.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-08 4
Easy To use, several kinds of search!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-08 5
I'm about to embark on a series of trips & rather than have my info all over the place I can keep it all on my kayak app (even if I didn't book everything through them). Also, I know I'm gonna have to buy a last minute ticket while in transit... I can do that all in this app.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-08 5
Top notch
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-08 5
Perfect app:)

Easy to use and great for quick travel.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-08 3
I like the app, and find it very useful. I noticed right away however that it doesn't allow as much flexible date info as the website, and neither offer as much flexibility as the Orbitz website. Fix that and it's a five-star app.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-07 5
Easy to use!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-02-07 4
Ok
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-07 5
mega mega megA
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-07 4
It doesn't save my searches, so no history appears, but it does preload the search with the last values when you open the app, so that works for me.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-07 5
Super easy to use and very fast!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-07 5

I literally booked a flight from SFO to JFK in ten minutes while I was waiting from my drink at happy hour. Even better, I was a first time user.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-05 5
Great App
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-05 5

Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-03 5
I've been using Kayak for a couple years and I love it. This App will literally take the time to find you the best priced air fare. Highly recommend it! Cuts the thinking out of the equation..
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-03 5
Love the interface!  Lots of info that's easy to find!

Nice app. Very convenient.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-03 1
Not enough info to warrant the app. A google search on my iPhone is more useful.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-03 4
love it !
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5
Has many features (even some you think you might not need) and it's free!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5

Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5
Enough said
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5
Flat out awesome.

This app is so well designed it's easier to use than the full website on a computer. I now shop for all my travel using this app and don't even bother with a pc anymore.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 4
Great app - as well made and useful as the safari version.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5
East to use, accurate price comparing.
All in one place- how did we ever manage without it?
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5
Great way to quickly research travel costs. Each update makes the app better.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 3
So this is one of the must have mobile apps for travel - but seriously - must my music be turned down or shut off every time I switch screens so you can whisper "Kayak" in my ear? 

Who thought that was a good idea? Please remove it. It is annoying and slightly creepy.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5
Makes planning trips soooooo easy, legit app!!!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5
Very useful

Easy to use, great app!!!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 3
It keeps crashing. I love the filters it has, but I wish it could search multiple airports.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5
I really like this Kayak app. I found flights on here for much cheaper than any of the other travel app. I also live that it sends notifications when a searched flight's price goes down. I don't know of any other one that does that.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-02 5
Good aggregator of flight info.  I routinely use Kayak to find flights.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-01 5
Works well. Quality interface.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-02-01 5
It's awesome! Better than computer version.

Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-28 5
great app! if u love going to different places local or not this is a must have app!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-28 4
I like the fact that this app provide many options for the available flights. But I'd love to see an improvement so that we could book thr tickets from within the app. Keep up the good work!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-28 5
Great app. Intuitive, well thought-out interface.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-28 4
New version UI is less intuitive that the previous version. Maybe it will take some getting used to. Can't complain about free, though -- still overall an excellent app.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-28 5
My favorite thing about this app is all the extras like the packing list feature and airport maps!
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-28 5
Period.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-28 5
I was VERY impressed with this app. My wife spent hours trying to find a cheap flight. This app beat her best price by at least a hundred dollars. 

If you ever fly or will every fly or think you might consider ever flying at any point in the future get this app.
Very easy to use, user friendly and fast.  A+++++
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-28 5
Easy to use, friendly interface, thus app is a great way to get cheap flights and hotels.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5
Found a cheap flight so easy, and setup a notification for cheap flights when they come up to a certain destination.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5
It works
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5

They get u the best price in the market
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5
Is the best app in his kind
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5
They did a great job with this app...I am really surprised that none of the big $ airline companies such as Delta are not capable of building a customer centric app...
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5
Kayak on the iPhone is the quickest, easiest way to search flights. It seems it's quicker even than Kayak.com. And kudos to the UX designer in this. Great interface. I love this app!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5
Awesome!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 2
Ok
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5
The truthh HIGHLY no as a matter o fact the ONLY recomendation if your trying have any travel plans on the iphone
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5
This app is such a time saver, love alerts!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-27 5

Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-26 5
If you're into traveling this is a must but
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-26 4
I already found a cheap flight
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-26 4
Helpful app!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-26 5
So easy to use.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-26 4
I've only used this app a bit but find it easy to use and helpful. 
My only complaint is that when sorting hotel results by price I need to pick 'cheap' or 'classy'
Since I'm always looking for a good price I fall into the 'cheap' category. I'd rather search by price 'low to high' then call myself 'cheap' LOL!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-26 5
Good app! Very useful!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-26 5
Killer app
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-26 5

I love how they keep updating the UI, and the usefulness of this app makes it a perfect travel app.  Thanks!!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 5
I didn't realize that Kayak is such a great app and even trip planner! Amazing!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 5
Even if you don't use it to buy tickets, it is an awesome itinerary app.  Just forward the itinerary email to them and all details are sorted including maps.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 5
I use the kayak app every day, just to browse for flights. Kayak is always the cheapest!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 3
When you did the last update one of my favorite feature disappeared. As far as I can tell, there is no way to create a "zone" to search inside on the map. Example: I used to be able to circle an area on the map and search for a hotel inside it. Not anymore. Give it back and the rating will go up for me.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 3
Love the app itself, but wish I could have the alert tell me when the price drops throughout the day.  I find that according to kayak's own price graph, I'm missing the lowest fares of the day. Needs some work!!!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 5
This app is easy to use and a must have for travelers.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 5
Love it!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 5
Very easy to use.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 5
Love it! Saved time, money, & everything was laid out perfectly.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 4
Saves a lot of time and clutter of the web
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 4
Can store my flight search and push price alert!  Useful when you want to book a flight in advance.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-25 4
Easy to use and useful travel app
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 4
Would give it a 5 if it had a way of seeing vacation packages like there web site.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 4
It's a good app, pretty helpful and best of all, free.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 5
New version rocks!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 2
Isn't that dumb?

How would I be able to review it properly?

So there ya go.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 1
This used to be a great app until the newest release. Now there is no way to reverse airports. No way to view current results. No way to choose non-stop preference. No way to see the entire selected airport name. Why did you take these options away?  Filters used to be nice an easy to use. Not anymore. Please return this app to the great app it was before.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 5
Honestly this app has quality and convenience of a good $5 app. It's so easy to use and the update made it even better. It's incredibly useful and helpful. I usually don't write reviews but that Kayak app is that good. I recommend it to anyone doing ANY kind of travel. It will literally save you time and money. Oh did I mention it's FREE. Get it.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 4
I'm giving four stars because I have not used it enough for five stars. So far, easy to navigate and great user interface. 
They are keeping up their good reputation with this app
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 5
Easy and very accurate...
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 5
I used this app to book my flights and find a great hotel!! It was nice to be able to compare hotels and prices with simplicity. Def recommend, esp for first time travelers
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 5
Its a great app! No issues ever! I use this app every day!!!! Love it
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 5
Easy to use
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 4
Non stop option is needed at the beginning of searches, please.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 5
I love it!!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-24 5
It's all I use. Do it.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 5
This app is awesome. Simple to use. Easy to find flights. I'm gonna use this to plan all of my travel this year.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 5
No ads
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 1
The new launched this January 2011 is a disaster!! Before one was able to select non-stop flight before making the search, now one has to make the search and then filter results. Selecting today's date on flight search was just a click, now is not possible.... Changing the city/airport direction of the flights was just one click to make reverse round-trip searches now not possible. Longer time for searches.... Will have to move to another provider!! :(
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 5
The app is next to none, love it!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 4
The only drawback is sometimes it lacks the cheapest flights within Europe.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 5
Love it how I can compare different sites in one app
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 5
I travel a lot, it did a good job to remind me of the price drop! Help me save $400! Recommend!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 4
I travel alot an this app was super fast an I dig it.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 5
Super helpful! Great!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 5
No complaints :)
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-23 5
Would recommend it to everyone!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-22 4
This is a great app! Would have been five stars if there was an iPad version...
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-22 5
Great way to stay organized. Keeps all my travel plans in one place and a ton of information about the airlines, airports, hotels, and travel locations.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-19 5
Great app!! Allows you to email your itineraries (for flights, hotels, cars booked on any site) and access them all in one place. For all it does, I can't believe it's free!!!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-19 4
I wish I could access other people's trips, those that I can see online because I've been given access. Other than that, it's an awesome app with great information so readily available!  Thanks Kayak!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-19 5
What with all the crap going on with airlines these days... It's good to know we can still go with KAYAK to help us find the best deals in town... And... It's easy to use and we'll always know the results will be accurate!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-19 5
The notifications are the best for keeping track of lowering prices.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-19 5
It's easy to use, great way to see the lowest price from all sites in one place. User friendly.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-19 4
Nice thing to have
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-19 5
Not an average junk.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-19 4
This app is definitely easier to use tuan a regular web page.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-18 4
This to me is the best place to stop and search all the sites for the best prices. A must have app
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-18 5
Good

Everything you'd ever want in a flight/hotel/car app is here!! The push notifications are *superb* and much appreciated!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-18 5
Better than the actual website!

Best travel app on the market. I have been using for years.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-18 5
This app replaced all of my other travel apps. It does everything I need it to do and all that it says it does.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-18 5
Download it!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-18 1
There are much better offers for European flights which can be found directly from European airlines.  Be ware, the rates showing are not the final rates, you might end up paying hundreds more ... Gas tax, airport tax, etc.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-17 5
Excellent app. When searching for flights though, I would like the refinements I made to not cancel when I change dates.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-17 5
This app has everything I could ever need while traveling abroad. I cannot think of anything that this app is wanting. And plus the only difference between the free and paid versions is the ads! I see no reason not to get this app if you do any amount of traveling.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-17 5
Con varias opciones y muy practica felicidades!!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-17 5

This is one of the best applications I've downloaded, I recomend it to everyone, this is must have application.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-17 5
This is a great app and the travel app I turn to first when I am looking for great prices and a flight schedule that works for me.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-17 4
Very useful for looking up flights frequently to see how prices fluctuate. Helps get tickets at a cheaper price.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-17 4
Very useful for someone traveling without fixed plans
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-16 4
1. Integrate frequent flyers programs or at least have a "wallet" to store all that info...

2. I lovey trips... I haven't yet tested but I hope it works offline so that once it's downloaded to the phone it stays there so even if I don't have an Internet connection I can see it.

3. Free wifi finder in airports... Allow people to post where wifi is available in various airports including passwords if necessary.

Good job Kayak!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-15 5
This app is a must have for travelers! It has everything from booking flights, car rentals, hotels to providing a packing check list! If you are a frequent traveler you need this app! It's a one stop shop! I give it a 5 star rating based on features and convenience.
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-15 4
Not a bad app does what it says
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-15 5
Nothing beats kayak. Wish SWA would cave and let kayak post their fares. What used to set SW apart is now common and they haven't invested in innovation.
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-15 2
I love this app. No other travel app is as easy or helpful. However recent updates have made it impossible to use. It crashes frequently. I can't finish booking on my mobile because it crashes so much. I tried re-download and reboot, it still crashes. Fix this Kayak!!!
Version 17.0.1. 2011-01-15 5
Great app I love using it!!

Love this app - super convenient and easy to use!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-13 4
Kayak makes orbits look bad because kayak is there when u need it.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-13 5
Can't believe this is FREE! This is an awesome app.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 2
Usually don't get involved in review writing, but please don't let your ego get in the way of changing this app back it's previous design. The previous graphical design was way better. The line press is played out and over utilized by iOS developers.  The orange boxes are much funner, intuitive and easier to read. Thanks, looking forward to updating my review very soon.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 4
I think the App is great! I've had some problems changing the date also but I've found that if you hold down on the date and drag it it will change. This could be Easily fixed in the next update! Thank You!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 5
This app is easy to us and reliable!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 4
All in one best travel app yet!!!,
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 5
can you added mileage plan storage feature
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 5
Actually very easy to use app.  This is how you would expect to purchase inexpensive flights on the iPhone!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 4
It is so accurate
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 3
It crashes when I try to view flight details.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 1
I am unable to select/change the date of travel, which renders this app totally useless. I have the latest version of the app.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 1
The updated version ruined a great app. The previous version looked better and was easier to navigate. I wish I had not updated :(
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 3
Loved the matrix in the old version.  Did the most perfect travel app need a new version?  Waaaaa :(
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 4
Super user-friendly!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 1
The last update is horrible, I used to love kayak but they took the flight times away from the initial results making the app useless.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 4
I can just get a vacation idea and check for the best deal, best time at the comfort of my couch, knowing I'll be able to find it here. That is very important. I love this app.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 5
I generally only use the flight search features.  The improved UI is excellent -- looks great, intuitive, and gets pretty much all of the website's features in touch-friendly display.  Actually, I think I prefer the iPhone app to their main website now.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 4
My job requires alot of last minute travel. Kayak is the best resource. Hate the latest update though. Wish they left it awesome.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 5
It's nice to use a site that's objective and gives you so many options.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 2
Can no longer narrow search results by departure and arrival times among numerous other factors that made the previous version and full site Kayak truly useful.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 5
I am really impressed! The UI is easy to use and very attractive. Bold and modern without sacrificing usability.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-12 4
Great app for looking for travel deals on the go.
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-11 5
This is one of the best app's especially if you fly a lot!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 5
Kayak.com is great and with the latest app update all the features I need from the website are on the phone. UI changes are generally cool although I miss the flipping animation from the main menu to the various views. Keep up the good work guys and gals!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 1
New UI is poor experience. The old calendar was the best of any iPhone app. Now i have to touch that tiny arrow with my fat fingers like all the other apps. What happened to the easy-to-interpret homepage? Now I have to scroll on a homepage? Switching back to Bing Travel.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 5
Does everything it's supposed to! Works great ;)
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 5
Thank you very much!!! Very useful!!!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 2
Becuz it is (was) a great app. But i liked the older interface. It was very basic and not too busy looking. This one has too much going on design wise. Travelers are stressed enough as it is. 

Oh and we want the calendar search option!!!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 5
Buena y facil de usar
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 4
Great app!!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 1
New version shows wrong detailed flight results after selecting a flight from the results listing. This bug makes the app unusable. 

Please do better testing before you take a perfectly working version away from us. 

How can we revert to the previous version while waiting for you to fix this one?
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 5
I really recommend this app!!!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 4
This app does a great job of bring a lot of information together in one place. Great!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 4
Good app!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 4
Great app, when it is actually running correctly, can't stand that it keeps booting me off -_-
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 1
Kayak is, hands down, the best travel website and app available. However, this new version of the iPhone app ruined a good thing.

User interface ultimately comes down to taste, and personally, I think this new UI is ugly and doesn't compare to the old UI.

I also noticed that in this new version, the 'map' feature is no longer available when searching for a hotel. It was one of the best features! Please bring it back.

To reiterate, I love the website, but hate the new app redesign.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 3
Bring back the 'tiles' please..update those if u have to. This interface and the lack of interactive hotel map is not great at all.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 1
Old version was way better.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 1
Did anyone test this before the new release? Flight does not allow me to change the date. It keeps the last day I searched for flights, which was last month, so completely useless.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 4
Why not have an option to switch UIs? Still great app though.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 5
Makes life easier
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 4
I liked the old home screen with the tiles. But I do like everything else better.
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-11 1
They removed interactive hotel map
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-10 3
Love tha options in search and great to have this as an app!
Version 17.0.0. 2011-01-10 1
App crashed as soon as I opened it & also when I do a search. They also don't show delta flights anymore so the app is useless to me. I will be deleting.
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-04 4
I love the Kayak site/app, but the iPhone app doesn't go the extra mile.  It would be nice if it had more intuitive features (like, it knows when I'm traveling, show my flight status automatically, don't make me click for it!)
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-03 5
Best travel app I've used to date - great interface!
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-03 5
I use this constantly and it is the best traveling tool because you always get the cheapest flight and only have to check one place. Love love love
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-03 5
Hotel rates, flight fares, landing schedules, and lots more
 functionalities packed into one great app! The interface is beautiful and elegant! Can't believe it's free! Thanks!
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-03 4
great app, great interface, easy to use and has a ton of "extras" that save you from having to download 3 other apps to do the same things!
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-02 3
It works well to look up specific dates and destinations but I really want an app that will show me the last minute cheap getaways. I want to know about that $39 ticket to Vegas!
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-02 4
Initially, I thought a kayak app would be unnecessary- why would I need to shop for flights on the go, when I could wait to do it at home. However, I've found it's great to have the info at your fingertips.
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-02 5
Great
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-02 1
This app was the best until I updated and now you can't search by dates.  They make you pick an airline.  How ridiculous and a waste of time!!!!!!!!!
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-01 4
Has everything you could need to plan your travel!
Version 14.0.5 2011-01-01 5

just got app last night due to tracking my flight today due to northeast blizzard conditions. i'll probably make a review when i use it some more. 

what did happen is the flight tracker didn't update at all from yesterday. luckily my flight is ontime
Version 14.0.5 2010-12-29 2
Never updates flight delays, and does not add itineraries.
Version 14.0.5 2010-12-29 5
This app is just brilliant and useful...
I strongly recommend it to everyone...
Every iPhone must have it!
Version 14.0.5 2010-12-29 5
This app is so amazing. I needed to book a flight after a missed flight and kayak helped me find the cheapest, quickest, best way to get to my destination. It was even better than the airlines. Download this app especially if you're in a tough spot and need a flight.
Version 14.0.5 2010-12-28 5

I like this app does wut describe to do! Ps its multi search is my favorite !

Great app, very convenient, has most of the website features.
Version 14.0.5 2010-12-25 4
it's an excellent app from the people who provided us the google of 'travel'.The coolest thing about this app is tgat it keeps almost the same uniformity & consistency just like the desktop version.It'll be great if they add vacation package deals from multiple sources too.keep up the good work guys
Version 14.0.5 2010-12-25 5
I don't travel than often, but it helped me to tell my friend and myself a couple of times what is the range of prices that they should expect.
Nice App!!!

Nice interface, awesome features, very quick. I now have everything I need for travel including phone numbers of all airlines. And last but not least, this app is FREE. 
Too bad this app can't make me coffee :)

Same old stuff
Version 14.0.5 2010-12-24 5
I'm more of a gamer than a deal junkie, so I'm always on the lookout for free game-boosting apps!
True, while I do see the benefits of using this app to find cheap hotels, good flights, and roadtrip planners, I must confess that I downloaded this app for 
a completely different reason!  I'm not sure I'll ever use it for anything, but I got 4 free "warbucks" to spend in the "Gun Bros." game app.  
Most apps only give you one or two "warbucks," but this one gives you four!  Thanks guys!   This app gets five stars!!!
p.s.  add "Spartan S-117" to your friends list on Game Center.

excellent app I love kayak all year round. what else I can ask!
Version 14.0.5 2010-12-23 4
Tried this alongside TripCase, and think I will switch to Kayak. I like the fact that I can both plan new trips and track existing ones in one place. Kayak imported an Amtrak reservation that TripCase could not. Kayak is also better at tracking status of flights that are not in your own itinerary. I also like the calendar subscription feature - very useful. All in all a great travel toolbox.
Version 14.0.5 2010-12-23 5
It's probably saved me a few hundred bucks over the past year or two. Cool features, user friendly interface.

Great! A must have app!

Hands down, this app is probably one of the best travel companion app out there...  I replaced the dependable USAToday travel app with this one.

Version 14.0.2 2010-12-06 5
This app is every bit as functional as the browser-based one. I completed a purchase started with Kayak Mobile and zero problems.  Getting to keep various routes and days helped immensely in trip planning. 
Great job!!!

This app is really good and helpful, thank to all who create it, and I want more and more.
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-04 5
This app is very useful.
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-04 5
Useful site
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-04 5
Works as advertised.
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-03 5
Great apps
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-03 5
It does it all, I like the checklist functionality.
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-02 5
Great app, really impressive functionality!
Version 14.0.2 2010-12-02 5
Great app!
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-02 2
The prices you get on the app are not consistent with the prices on kayak's main site! Having to check the website on a desktop machine makes this app superfluous. The prices on here are high by several hundred dollars and are basically a tax on the lazy and those without access to a computer.
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-02 4
I like it
Version 14.0.0 2010-12-02 5
Incredible app. It's only gotten better and better!

PS. Check out kayak.com/explore....literally my favorite website.
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-01 5
Very handy for multiple city itinerary.
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-01 1
I used kayak for the first time today. When checking the status of my AirTran Flight it kept saying it was on time yet the flight was delayed by 3 hours. Out of curiosity I checked much later that evening and the app showed an on time delivery. Again...we landed 3 hours late. How can I rely on the app?
Version 14.0.4 2010-12-01 5
Logging in to add my upcoming flight details. Will tell me my flight status and what terminal to tell the cabbie. I use this app for wert flight.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-30 5
Es lo mejor q hay esta bien detallada
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-30 5
Great app but still needs more updates to be like the website. Good job with kayak :)
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-30 4
Good app. But need more sources
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-30 5
Great app!
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-29 5
Like it!
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-29 5
Better than the website in every way.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-29 5
Awesome app. Way better than tripit. I would really like the ability to share my itineraries with family and friends who don't have a Kayak login. And is that link only viewable on mobile devices?
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-29 3
Very useful app.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-29 5
Fantastic app. Looks great works better.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-29 5
.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-28 5
Really cool app. Good user interface, flexible options and you can set fare alerts for email, push notification or both. It even links you to the carrier websites to buy. And it's free!
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-28 5
But can't choose flexible date!
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-28 4
Great for travel
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-28 5
Functional.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-28 5
I wear out travel sites, but this one is the best by far for int'l and domestic trips.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-28 5
Easy to use and it gives lots of options
Version 14.0.0 2010-11-27 5
Can't complain, this app is great. Does everything it is intended to do.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-27 4
I was able to quickly and effectively search for a flight that was very reasonable!! This year I moved away from my family so I'll be back and forth from NY to Detroit alot, this app will come in handy! Thanks Kayak!
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-27 1
I fly international and this App is limited to domestic airports only.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-27 4
I'd seen the commercials, but didn't really know what this was. Since it was a free app I decided to DL it and check it out. I discovered it really has a lot of useful tools to help plan your trip. It kind of is a one-stop-shopping place. I like how it has a lot of info built into the app and what it doesn't already list, it has links links directly to a travel company websites for more details. I haven't tried booking a reservation through Kayak yet., bit I need to find a hotel room for a trip next month so we'll how that works out. This app is definitely worth the download!
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-27 5
This app is incredible. I only installed this app to earn free points on MegaJump. It turns out that this app is really useful. I used this app to book hotel rooms for bargain basement prices. You can sort your searches by location, cheapest, classy, and others. It would be nice to add a feature that would couple a few qualifiers such as closest cheap hotels. But all in all I give five stars! Very useful.
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-27 5
So helpful
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-27 4
Really good app to find nice deals  !!
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-27 3
Pretty helpful
Version 14.0.4 2010-11-27 5
This is realy helpful
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-26 4
Good app that will provide you with some quick and cheap pricing. The best part is when you send the application referral e-mail to any of your contacts... Download it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-26 4
I would give this app 5 stars, but in order to do so it would need Amtrak fares as well.
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-26 4
A great app for travelers. Has everything you need to plan and while on the go. Easy to use interface. Would have given 5 stars but was missing the St. Louis Airport which is a major airport compared to some listed. PLEASE ADD IT IN NEXT UPDATE!!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-25 5
I use it every day! Great, great, great app!!!
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-25 1
New version for IOS4.2 crashes 100% of the time when using cool new flight status feature and alerts. Can I revert to old version?
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-25 5
Great app. Very easy to use. Interface is very user friendly.  All the options a traveler needs are included in this app. Best way to search hotels.
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 5
Not cool
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 5
I have L0VED! This App ever since it came out.. the updates are sweet!
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 5
I love this app it has saved me a couple times and always finds great deals
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 5
It's a very useful app.
Version 14.0.0 2010-11-24 5
The Kayak application is definitely the most powerful and thorough flight search application I have ever used. When combined with the unique features of the iPhone interface, and real-time search updating with intuitive search modifications for people with most any need, be it time or price or airport options, airline restrictions and more, it just doesnt get any better than this. 

Personally, I am in a place in life right now where I am traveling almost constantly and I can't put this app down. When combined with the southwest, priceline, flight update and weather app, you really have a powerhouse travel agency at your fingertips.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-24 5
Great customization and simple. Found the best rate on this immediately. Wasted hours of research after I already found the best rate on here. So it proved to find the best flight for me. Win
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 2
It's a nice app but the trip feature does not work. Even though a trip is added to my account and I can see it online, the app won't show the trip. Otherwise awesome app.
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 1
Even after restarting the phone, it just crashes when you touch Flight Status. Doesn't anyone test these apps?
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 5
Very useful while planning the travel and during the journey as well.
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 5
Just a great app.
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 5
It is fast and gives all the options. Available with great ease of use
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-24 2
I am trying to check my Aunt's flight status but whenever I type in all the information on "Flight Status" it just x's me off the app! I have tryed 4 times and it hasn't worked ANY time!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-23 5
It has many many options! One of my favorites is the packing checklist!
Version 14.0.3 2010-11-23 4
A huge congrats to the development team on an excellent application. Like its web-based big brother, it is intuitive, easy to use, full featured, fast and just pleasant to look at and interact. Great job Kayak!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-23 5
Thank you!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-23 3
Really like this app
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-23 5
Love this app. Super easy to use, and in my opinion, easier to use than the PC website or the mobile website. Best travel app I've downloaded, and I've downloaded quite a few.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-22 3
Has some problems with applying time filters. Sometimes the filters go through and sometimes they don't. Otherwise a great app.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-22 4
Only knock is that it doesn't give the total cost of the flight including taxes & fees until you tell it to book the flight. Other than that, it is very user friendly and fun to use!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-22 5
It doesn't matter if you are a frequent traveler or planning your first trip, this app is a must have. It has everything you need or all types of trips. Do download it, it will help you very much.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-22 4
This app is a great resource for planning a trip.  First place I go  on the iphone when needing flight prices and options.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-22 5
This is the best app ever!!!!
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-16 5
Almost... But it is a great app and the only thing I use to search for flights from my iPhone. It's fast and flexible
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-16 5

Version 14.0.2 2010-11-15 4
:)
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-15 2
Poorly designed App. Should open with option to identify city to which one wants to travel; instead app keeps trying to load all nearby cities.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-15 5
Best app ever but should have games in it for while you wait
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-15 5
No real complaints.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-15 5
Excellent app that provides almost all of the capabilities of the web site. Have been using it since version 1 and like that they have improved it steadily.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-14 5
It's  one of most useful app... Pretty simple also...
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-14 1
Anyone who forces me to review gets 1 star.

Version 14.0.2 2010-11-14 5
Makes traveling easy and fun.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-14 5
There is no way you can write anything negative about this application. It is absolutely, positively the best app out there for making travel arrangements on the iPhone/iPad
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-14 5
Very easy to use!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-13 4

Accurate info anthems flights and the fare
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-13 1
This is a great app up until it freezes or crashes!  I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it several times, but it always crashes.  Please fix!!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-13 4
Plan a trip at your fingertips, easy to use.

I'm always fumbling with my iteneraries and using multiple browsers...this makes my jet setting life just that much less hectic
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-12 5
Kayak app is my first choice for searching for airfares and other travel choices. I have this app on both my iPhone and the iPad. It is even better on the iPad with the larger screen. Screen layout and search options work great.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-12 5
Everything you need - right here.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-12 4
Great app. I just wish I could buy right from the app without having to switch to my browser. Please make this possible in the future.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-12 5
As a small business flying around the US can become hectic with flights and schedules to keep up with. Kayak, not only makes it easier to search for the lowest prices out there....make sure to use the trips icon which let's you store your trip info, such as flight, hotel, and car details, all in one app! I'm so glad I have come to familiarized with this app...I strongly recommend you use it!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-11 5
The best app
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-11 5
The best multiple app ever!!!!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-11 5
Not only is this one of the best-written apps I've seen, but the Kayak support team is super friendly, personable, and helpful!  Kayak is my new favorite website!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-11 5
So many options to look at flights! Time, airline, landing, direct.... So easy to use and understand great job
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-10 2
Everything on the app is good, apart from flight status which is very inaccurate.  Do not rely on this for actual status of flights.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-10 5
I use this app for most travel planning. It has tons of info and is very user friendly.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-09 5
If Kayak were a lady, i would have married her. This is the first day I am using Kayak app and I am just browsing it as if playing game. I bet I am going to have a long relationship with this app.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-09 5
This is and AWSOME APP..I Like the fact that I can get Alerts on when Prices are lower for Flights.This is Very useful for me when Planning My Summer Vacation.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-09 5
Easy to use, and works just like described.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-08 5

Version 14.0.2 2010-11-07 4
Little slow but great!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-07 5
I use this regularly to track upcoming trips. It saves recent queries so you return to where you left your last search
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-07 5
cant ask for anything more, excellent app, a download must
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-07 5
I love this app
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-07 5
These guys have improved this app so much over time. Baggage fees and phone #'s for all major airlines? A packing list, fare alerts, and detailed airport directories? CURRENCY CONVERTER? What will they think of next?  Highly recommended.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-06 4
Overall the application is great.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-06 5
Convenient setting, good search engine.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-06 5
Very impressive app, very useful, and very practical. You have everything at your fingertip. From hotel to flight, from car rental to baggage check, and even tracking your flight. This app is a must have.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-06 5
A must have, very handy
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-05 5
This app just keeps getting better and better with frequent updates and new features. I actually think it's better than the desktop version. Well worth the download.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-05 5
This is easily the best app in the store.
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-05 5
Kayak was already great on the web for cheap flights and now an app it's just awesome!!!
Version 14.0.2 2010-11-05 5
Great app!! So many things you can do!! You guys read my mind about the flexible dates! Please add a filter to adjust layover times tho. Some flights are 12hours stuck in another country.. It'd be really nice to eliminate those if possible..Thanks!!!
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-05 4
Great app! Works awesome and best free app for this need! Would easily give it 5 stars if on the map with the cool blinking plane it also showed a route pattern the plane would be taking. In other words a line from point "a" to point "b"! Keep up the good work guys!!!
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-05 5
Kayak just works. The only feature I would recommend for mobile users is the ability to see and compare airfare prices listed by days of week. This would help users so they don't have rerun a search query.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-05 5
Great app that has a better price
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-05 5
Quick, easy, comprehensive app. ideal for looking for flights etc.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-04 3
It works for what I need and it is fast and simple. I like this app a lot.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-04 5
The app is both useful and fun! It has lots of features that are quirky but cool. Like being able to send a friend an email with a map of where you are from in the app. And it has a list of major airlines, a currency converter, the ability to set alerts, etc., which round it out as a travel app.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-04 4
Very helpful and easy to use !
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-04 4
A little frustrating if I am doing a lot of searching and definitely not as good as the website, but still worth keeping.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-04 5
Heat interface, great results!
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-04 1
I wish it would have worked.  But it keeps crashing instead.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-04 5
Love it
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-04 5
Love the App - just like the website - very easy - helped me out a few times when needing a quick one stop price
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-03 5
Great app
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-03 4
Love this app! The only problem (and it is a big concern) is the inability to purchase insurance when buying airline tickets. Other than that, this is a wonderful way to find the lowest price on a flight (without long layovers!) Easy search, easy purchase, and Kayak charges NO FEES.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-03 5
Love it!
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-02 5
Love this app. No issues.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-01 5
It works great
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-01 5
Easier than searching online with kayak!
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-01 1
Grossly overpriced!
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-01 5
this app makes booking flights really easy to do on the go. I don't even need to check other sites before confidently hitting that "purchase" button.
Version 14.0.1 2010-11-01 4
Would recommend
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-31 4
This is my first choice when searching for flights and rooms. I'd give it a 5 if it searched the airline sites better.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-31 4
Great app
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-31 5
Great app always low prices and easy to book

Version 14.0.1 2010-10-30 4
Great app that is well designed and very useful.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-30 5
Flying all over the US for interviews and seriously, I'd be lost without it! Especially bc I'm not using a single airline for all my travels. This app keeps everything together in one place.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-29 5
This is a good app.gets an (A+)
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-29 2
This app would be awesome if it could run for more than 30 seconds without crashing.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-29 4
This app is completely a must have if you are a traveler, interested in traveling, or planning for someone else. By far my favorite app, only 4 stars because I only wish it had cruise info. Download it now!!!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-29 4
Great. Does what they claim
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-29 4
keep up the good work!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-28 5
Great app, no reason not to add it to your front page.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-28 5
Just awesome....
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-28 4
Nice app, booked my whole trip on one app: hotel, car and airfare...easy!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-28 5
This app is easy to use and quick
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-28 5
I really like Kayak's iPhone app! The custom fare tracker alerts are great and it's so easy to check on flight costs, plus it has so many other features built in. Great job!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-27 4

Perfect app!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-26 4
I built my trip information in the kayak site, then it shows in the iPhone.  The information is well organized and displayed.   Suggestion: 1. Need revision function in the iPhone version. 2. New function for entering the expense during the travel.  
Overall, good job.  It's a great app.

This app is so useful, it has so much information! This will definitely save you a lot of time!!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-26 4
Very useful app. Planning trip out west using this app. When I land, I'll use it again to find a car rental.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-26 2
The site is okay at best.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-25 5
Does everything as described! Great app with a lot of information, great management of trips features!

Very helpful.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-24 5
Get this app n stop asking questions :-)
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-24 4
Great app for all around price comparison. I wish purchasing ticket would be part of the app though.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-23 5
Great deals and info for all my travel
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-23 5
Very useful, love it!

Version 14.0.1 2010-10-22 5
Very useful for travel.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-21 5
Great free app, especially for the frequent traveller.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-21 5
I used this to book a trip a while ago, and it was great. But I got inspired to write a review about its awesomeness after using the flight tracker to monitor my friend's flights. Amazing, especially considering that it's free!! I heart Kayak.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-21 5
I love this app! I was able to find a cheap flight for my friend and it has all of the features that the regular site has on a computer. It's so easy to use and it's nice to be able to look at something when you want to. Totally recommend this app to anyone who wants to make travel planning easier for them!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-21 4
This app has really helped me find flights that I need at a low price and it's really intuitive to use
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-21 5
It's very user friendly and it was very helpful when I received a notification of a price alert so I can go home for a vacation.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-20 4
Great app. The app was easy and saved me some money.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-20 5
Great app for travellers.  Good way to plan out an agenda and send to everyone.
Version 14.0.0 2010-10-20 5
We look up flight prices all the time-so quick to use & get an idea about travel plans in a flash. Highly recommend this app for frequent travelers.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-20 5
Very nice app.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-20 5
I like the trip organizer, which acts like the app called " trip it"
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-20 5
Love the flight tracker

Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 5
Exellent App. Very well designed and gives what you need.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 2
I still don't like apps that only provide interfaces to web pages that one can already access.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 4
So easy to use and keeps trips organized for you.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 5
Best travel app
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 5

Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 5
Super helpful. Try it out!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 5
This is a must have app for anyone thinking about traveling. Easy to use interface makes it easy to find and purchase what ever you need to get where your going.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 5
Good job developer! Excellent features, clean layout, very useful app for travelers!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 5
Just what is needed. Great interface. Befitting app for the iPhone
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-19 2
? I only download this app for some start for another game and I still didn't get my starts :(
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 4
Awesome
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 4
It's been a good app. What else is there to say.  When I want to go somewhere I use it.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 5
Everything you could want while traveling and more!!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 5
Love the tracker, beacon and packing list
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 5
It helps me alot when planning any kind of trips
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 5
Quick results and variety of search options. Great for new and current Kayak users.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 4
Blahhh
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 3
Well ?
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 5
Great app
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 3
Very good
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-18 3
Exactly ok
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
Kayak.com is already an awesome site. App is well done and easy to use.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
Good app
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
Awesome app!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 4
Pretty cool app!

Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
Just a darn good app!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
Great way to find the best deals in one app
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
Does everything I need in one app. Froze a couple of times which I had to delete and reinstall to get it working again but still a great app overall.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
Great travel app
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
Awesomeeeeeeeeee!  Life saver.  Even if im not flying its nice to check the prices of hypothetical flights to give you an idea on prices.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
Great search engine app for everything. I use it all the game. Very easy to use.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 4
Is quicker and easier to use than the web. The carry on pack list and and other tools are a friendly touch. Could be better if you could apply trip packages (car, hotel, flight,) instead of doing them separate
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-17 5
On a recent trip, kayak sent me an alert that our flight was delayed by an hour. UsAirways sent no such alert and therefore we would have missed our connection. As a result of the Kayak alert I called the airline and they were able to put us on an earlier flight. Thank you Kayak!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-16 5
My Jetblue flight was delayed by one hour, KAYAK showed that delay immediately, I asked the Jetblue checkin and they confirmed the delay. Believe it or not but the airport display in Seattle did not show the delay for 1 hour! Also other iPhone apps did not show the delay either. I enjoyed the extra time in the airport bookstore and arrived on time at the gate. Thanks KAYAK for the hasslefree extra hour.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-16 5
Quick accurate info, love it!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-16 5
Cool
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-16 4
This is a great app. It's very easy to use and it's not cluttered with unnecessary graphics.

The Kayak app is like having several travel apps consolidated into just one app. :-)
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-15 4
Simple , does not crash, best travel app tho bing is my favorite
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-15 5
Has all the functionality as the website.
Version 14.0.0 2010-10-15 5
Use their website all the time to find cheap flights.  Their app is almost as functional working with a lot less real estate, and I was just looking for a flight departure/arrival app when I realize that this Kayak app give me that info too.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-15 4
The flight tracking feature is a trip!! Like the fact that you can get all kind of travel info.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-15 4
It's a nice app. The car area was excellent in getting us a car when we arrived.
Version 14.0.0 2010-10-14 2
I would have given this app 5 stars if I were able to book and pay for my flight within the app itself instead of having to "call the airline" or go to a separate website. Otherwise excellent. And free! Good job!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-13 5
It's quick and easy searching for flights. It's a great app!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-13 5
I go to this app for all my travel planning. I just wish it wouldn't crash. It doesn't do it too frequently.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-12 4
Excellent app for travel. The best I've used so far. Very functional. Not as intuitive as I'd like. Example - not obvious how to choose to search flights with a flexible date range.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-12 4
The best of it's kind, no contest!!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-12 5
Everything for travel all in one
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-12 4
No complaints
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-12 5
Clean design, simple yet very powerful search engine.  This app should receive an award for ease of use.  One of my favorites!! Thanks to the developer.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-12 5
I travel every week and I can't live without this app!!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-12 5
I love this app and especially the Trips feature. I just discovered this after returning from a NYC trip when I used the TripIt app. After having compared both itineraries, I preferred Tripit's display because it was larger, easier to understand and had details that Kayak did not that I thought were important. I took the train, so knowing the details of train number and type was very useful when reading train schedules at the station since my stop was not displayed at the station (since it was a midway stop) So I guess to sum it up:

1. Make the display in Trip section larger. 
2. Format it similar to TripIt
3. Provide more details such as train/flight number, type, etc. 

Overall, the rest of the app is 5 star. Would be 5 star for Trips if it was more like TripIt. I'd really prefer to not use two apps when Kayak could be my one stop app :)
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-11 3
Still crashes upon selecting flights to track, even after the update that supposedly fixed the problem. The seperate kayak flight tracker app doesn't have this problem so I know they are capable of making it work right.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-11 5
Everything about this app is great. Beacon feature, trips, flight statuses, airline fees, ETC are executed elegantly.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-11 5
Keeps getting better, thanks Kayak!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-11 5
Great for real-time flight pricing
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-11 4
Great app
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-10 5
I use app anytime I travel.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-10 4
Very easy to use and provides all one needs for a successful travel experience.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-10 4
If you love "regular" Kayak, you'll enjoy this app. Function is more than you'd expect in app (ability to search multiple dates AND/or narrow results by very specific criteria).  Great to use on the go!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-10 4
Easy to look up and book flights!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-09 5
+1 internets
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-09 5
I've always liked the kayak.com search tool. The nobile version is as good as the website.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-09 5
I'm not what you would call a seasoned traveler but this app has made traveling much less nerve wracking!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-09 4
This is a great app for travel on the go
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-08 4
Nice app. I just would like to be able to build an entire trip with taxes etc. and have the prices auto update so o don't have to price out a trip again. Saving the built itinerary would be nice too.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-08 4
Good but a little slow
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-08 1
what happened to kayak? it doesn't open anymore. I deleted and tries to reload and now a gray icon in mid load is all I have. please fix!!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-08 5
No problems using app - works great & I compared to expedia and prices were right on
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-08 5
This is the best flight search I have found.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-08 5
Love it!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-07 5
Saves a lot  of time. A must have app.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-07 4
Excellent tool for travel
Version 14.0.0 2010-10-07 5
I love the ability to use the time slider to pick my needed departure and arrival times.  Eager to learn more about the other features.  This is the only app I use for planning flights.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-07 5
Only place I'll use now for plane tickets.
Version 14.0.0 2010-10-07 5
Much more robust - easy to use. So far I've only researched flights but very impressed by speed and usability. Nice work!
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-07 4
I haven't used it for a trip yet but I've got one planned and I love that I can just send an email and it organizes my flight!!
Version 14.0.0 2010-10-07 5
My favorite travel site. No frills, smart and user-friendly.
Version 14.0.1 2010-10-07 5
Awesome app...I love it...
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-05-15 5
Awesome , I buy all my trips on kayak ( and yes they are many :)  , love the new update , I don't need to use my computer anymore , kayak Anywhere and everywhere ! Long live kayak !
Version 11.0.0.0 2010-05-15 5
Ability to narrow hotel searches by dragging and resizing a radius circle on a map is a great feature...great app for on-the-go planning.
Version 11.0.0.0 2010-05-14 5
Latest update is the best on-stop flight search out there. One minor bug: upgrade button tells you price of Pro version is $0.99 then takes you to app store where it's actually $1.99. Fix to avoid bait/stitch accusations.
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-05-12 5
Great app! Searches most travel websites and gives you THE BEST DEALS out there.goin to FL frm SEA on the 24th... Thanks KAYAK!!
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-05-10 4
How about a total time duration for the whole trip if more than one flight? Is that difficult to add?
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-05-05 3
I like the basic premise that Kayak brings to the table but I simply don't have the time to waste booking on multiple sites.  I find the entire process slow and a bit cumbersome. But the app is useful for those that have the time.
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-29 1
When I click to change locations I keep getting this error "Uh-oh, trouble connecting to Kayak. Try again." I removed and downloaded it again and I still get the message everytime I try to change the location.
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-27 4
What's up with this new icon..? totaly nonsense... I deleted this app because of that.
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-26 1
Perhaps I just don't understand the purported benefits of this application. Linking me to Orbitz is not what I need when searching for hotel. Nor is the hotel's telephone number. I need to specify the hotel I want and for the app to find the best deal for that hotel - using multiple sources. I can visit Orbitz.com in Safari all by myself. Besides, over half of the time Kayak app can't connect to its servers - on WiFi or 3G.
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-26 5
Definitely one of the best apps i've ever got. Fast and easy
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-20 5
Very good app. So far has been accurate. This one us a keeper.
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-19 4
Great so far, just like on the computer!
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-18 5
love this app!
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-18 2
When it hits the calendar to pick a date
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-18 5
Checks hundreds of flights in mere seconds. This app is a real time saver. Highly recommended. 
Sam R.
Version 2.2.0.2 2010-04-17 5
A very nice app, may I suggest you contacting app rebates and putting the free app in the list
Version 2.2.0.1 2010-04-15 3
Upgraded and it's not as lean and fast as before. Kind of clunky and forgets previous searches. Would love to roll back to the original.
Version 2.2.0.1 2010-04-13 4
Very good app for searching and book trips without a laptop or any computer. I book all my last travel with the help of this app.
Version 2.2.0.1 2010-04-12 1
NEED MORE!!! WHEN YOU PLAN TO RENT A CAR NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO RETURN THE CAR TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION!!!!! THIS IS EXTREMLY IMPORTANT FOR ME!!!!
Version 2.2.0.1 2010-04-11 5
I love how you can flick your finger to select date ranges. very cool. Please, wizards at Kayak, add flight status! Thanks
Version 2.2.0.1 2010-04-09 5
You really have to try it for yourself! Seriously it's that great
Version 2.2.0.1 2010-04-05 3
I THOUGHT this would end my having to drag a lap top with me everywhere. NOPE.  I was trying to get multiple flight prices to multiple destinations.  At one point it told me I had exceeded the allotted number of seraches?  Really? So, not all it's cracked up to be. 

Version 2.2.0.1 2010-04-03 4
Good app, but almost useless. It crashed way too much. Usually within 2 minutes of being in the app.
Version 2.2.0.1 2010-03-30 5
this app is exactly what it should be. I can't tell you the number of times I've used this while in an airport when my flight was goofed. it's a perfect app for last minute arrangements as well as planning ahead. I love the fact that you can save your trips (by simply forwarding confirmation emails!) and refer to them on the iPhone app while on the road. 

highly recommended for anyone who travels. 

(note: I'd love to have the ability to search for multi-destination flights)
Version 2.2.0.1 2010-03-28 2
This would be a great app but it locks you out for an indefinite period of time after just a few searches! I was locked out in the middle of something critical and it was really frustrating. Not clear whether you still get locked out if you pay, so I am looking for something more reliable.
Version 2.0.1 2010-01-05 5
I absolutely love this app it is accurate fast and a beautiful UI.   thanks
Version 2.0.1 2010-01-04 5
I really like this app just I flight often to multi destinations and I don't have the ability of booking my flights thru this app. I hope we will have it soon!! Congrats!
Version 2.0.1 2010-01-04 5
Love the app, love the site, works fine anywhere.
Version 2.0.1 2010-01-03 4
This app is cool, but there is a search limit, so no bargain hunters or people getting ideas for prices.
Version 2.0.1 2010-01-02 4
I will never book my travel any other way, couldn't be easier to sort through airfare options! Hotel listings need more photos, other than that, this app is awesome!!!
Version 2.0 2010-01-02 5
I loved it before the recent update, and you've taken it to another level. Way to go! I used this a few months ago to book hotel accommodations and it worked wonderfully; this will definitely remain a regular for me.
Version 2.0.1 2010-01-02 5
Kayak keeps adding new features every month or so. Version 2.0 has a lot of new things that are not mentioned on the iTunes page: 
- more currency choices
- "prefer nonstop" option
- "include nearby airports" option
- multiple passengers
- multiple hotel guests
- multiple hotel rooms
- additional filter options

Version 2.0 2009-12-30 1
It loaded, however, it never works.  The "K" screen appears, then it faids away.  Absolutly useless!
Version 2.0 2009-12-30 4
I have found kayak to be one of the best travel apps out there for comparing flights and hotels. I used the app for a trip to Denver this week and it worked flawlessly. I do wish it had the ability to search using multiple flight segments
Version 2.0 2009-12-29 5
Crashes like a hell.
Version 2.0 2009-12-28 5
Just perfect for my needs - for free!
Version 2.0 2009-12-27 5
If you don't already use Kayak, you are wasting your money. The website offers a few extras that the app does not, such as multiple-leg segments and flex dates, but it's still better than any other travel search apps. Kayak, please add these options so we are website free!
Version 2.0 2009-12-27 5
Would be even better if Buzz reflected ticket prices in search month. I've pointed all my friends to this app... It's free, it's easy to use and it works!
Version 2.0 2009-12-27 3
The newer version crashes less often than that of six months ago, but I still need multiple city searches and flexible dates before I leave Orbitz. Keep at it!
Version 2.0 2009-12-27 3
Huge fan of Kayak, and I used the old version all the time. But I haven't been able to conduct a single search with out it crashing since I "upgraded" to v2.0!! So frustrating!
 
Only giving this particular version three stars. Kayak overall gets a five!'
Version 2.0 2009-12-25 1
Keeps saying cannot connect to server
Version 2.0 2009-12-24 5
In this app you'll find everything you need to book a flight, hotel, car rental and more !

I've found the best rates here, flight and hotel (it uses booking.com). In march we'll be going to NYC !
Thanks a lot Kaiak !

Most important: this app is free and does not contain ADS ! 
Beautiful.
Roger, Belgium.
Version 2.0 2009-12-23 4
Love Kayak, love the app, but please add multi-city flight search (which your website offers and does a great job of). Should not be all that difficult to implement as this app already offers one-way lookups. Will go to 5-star for me when this is added. Thanks and please keep up the excellent work!
Version 2.0 2009-12-20 5
I love kayak and this app is very easy and accurate.
Version 2.0 2009-12-18 5
A+!!!! APP!!!! Best travel app ever!!!
Version 2.0 2009-12-16 2
Great idea. I especially like the Trips feature, but it crashes too much. We need an update!
Version 1.6.1 2009-12-15 4
This is one of the best on the go tools
I wonder if people really know about it or not coz I don't think so
Version 2.0 2009-12-14 4
I wish they would add a feature where you can look for a flight/car/hotel package. If they add that I will give it 5 stars. Other than that I love this app. Very easy to use. I've not had any crashing problems. I can't believe this app is free.
Version 2.0 2009-12-14 5
This is a really well designed app. It's easy to use and fast (on Wi-fi). As another reviewer noted, the ability to do multiple segments would be nice. But this is a free app after all. They've thrown down the guantlet to Orbitz and the airlines.
Version 1.6.1 2009-12-12 3
I only use Kayak for flights, but I find it lacking even in that. I rarely fly alone, but Kayak gives you no opportunity to specify how many tickets you want in the app. Worse, neither do the companies you actually buy from, when you follow the links from Kayak's app. So I can't actually use the app to purchase anything, only to window-shop. Also, the drag-to-select dates feature is a nice idea but completely fails if you're leaving near the end of the month and returning in the beginning of the next month.

Fix these issues and it'll be a five-star app. But not being able to actually purchase from it is a deal-breaker.
Version 2.0 2009-12-12 4
Forget the rest
Version 2.0 2009-12-11 1
I'd like to give a more comprehensive review, but this app crashes every time I've tried to use it.
Version 2.0 2009-12-11 3
Need to be able to search for multiple flight segments (e.g. Baltimore to Salt Lake to Lexington and back to Baltimore). Almost all my trips are multiple-segment flights. I'd even pay a few bucks for such a thing.
Version 2.0 2009-12-10 2
When seaching for a flight it would be better if we could put in criteria before the initial search. Dissappointing
Version 2.0 2009-12-09 5
This app is incredibly useful, and the latest update included a great user interface overhaul as well as the ability to track existing trips, and the app is faster than ever now, which addresses my only real complaint about previous versions. Highly recommended!
Version 2.0 2009-12-09 3
This is a very useful app. But lately i've been able to find cheaper flights elsewhere. COME ON. step it up!
Version 2.0 2009-12-09 2
Too simple, lacks search options. Cannot specify class in airline search, quality or neighborhood in hotel search. For example Mexico city (20 million people, bigger than some countries) returns thousands of results, pointless!!! Too bad because the GUI and speed of search is tops in the field.
Version 2.0 2009-12-09 5
Best app for searching travel related info at the moment in the free app side...I used it mainly for searching overseas flights etc, it gave me very competitive pricing...like it and will keep it
Version 1.6.1 2009-12-09 1
How many times do I need to dload the app update?  Either it's not updating or something else is wrong.  Very annoying
Version 1.6.1 2009-12-09 2
I've tried downloading the latest update about a thousand times with no luck.
Version 1.6.1 2009-12-09 1
But it keeps insisting i havent downloaded the update in the app store.
Version 2.0 2009-12-09 5
I've tried a lot of other services, but I keep on coming back to Kayak.
Version 1.6.1 2009-12-08 5
Great mobile solution to get flight times/prices on the go.
Version 1.6.1 2009-12-05 4
Very quick and good usability. However I would like the option to share my results
Version 1.6.1 2009-12-04 1
Crashes all the time and I can never get it to find airports so essentially it's useless.
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-30 4
Have used this app several times and i am very pleased with the results.
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-30 5
Worked great for me. Hasn't crashed yet and I love all the filters.
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-29 2
It won't let me search anymore because I exceeded my search allowance. It is not really free because they want you to purchase the apps after you exceeded your search or else, you have to wait I don't know how long before you can search flights again.
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-29 3
But would be nice for option to email results
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-26 2
Could be a great, great app but it just crashes WAY to much. Multiple times when I try to use it. Some searches would make the app crash everytime, making those searches impossible. Fix the crashes and add date ranges for flexible searches and you've got a slam dunk 5 star app!
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-26 4
Why can't I open it up?? I need to use it everyday! Please do something
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-25 5
Just downloaded this app to check some ticket prices and was surprised at  how good the UI was and how well it worked. It also searches fir hotel and car rentals. A must have!!!
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-19 5
I like kayak
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-17 4
useful for unexpected travel! would like to be able to search fares from multiple airports at once...
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-16 5
better the paid app
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-13 4
Crashes sometimes. Would be nice to have flexible dates. Thanks!
Version 1.6.1 2009-11-02 4
This app is great for on the go ticket prices, the only thing I would like to see is the ability to do multi-city flights.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-31 4
This is a nice app that makes it extremely quick and easy to check the latest fares.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-27 5
Very fast! And accurate I was able to find a flight quick and easy.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-23 5
Helps me a lot.Great companion for a traveler like me.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-21 4
When the app doesn't crash - it's wonderful. I prefer Kayak over the purchased app that I was using to find flights. Too bad I found this after purchasing a flight search app.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-21 1
Since last update, this app crashes repeatedly, making it unusable.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-21 5
I've used this app quite a few and it's a HIT keep on ur good work thank you KAYAK
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-19 4
Fast and easy!!
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-16 4
Easy to use, fast, responsive, beats Expedia/Travelocity etc online. Love the Trends feature!
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-11 3
Many functionalities are missing
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-11 1
Glitches, crashes and does not find the cheapest fares.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-11 3
1.6.1 fixes the icon great. I couldn't stand to look at it before. How about the title Kayak instead of KAYAK to be even more consistent with other apps. At least it doesn't start with lower case. 

Seems pretty stable so far the few times I used it. Look forward to future UI and functionality improvements. For ex some infrequent routes could use some helpful hints such as what days if the week have any flights possible for ex from SFO to BON (I had to read some web articles to figure the
possible days out) 

================

It was a decent app before, a sometimes useful interface to the kayak site. The new app however crashed several times in a row before finally starting up properly. And the icon, as others already pointed out, is woeful to look at - they've decided in the interest of their new "branding" that they will use some rectangular shape that is painfully out of place on the iPhone screen. I do not understand, sympathize, or have any tolerance for vendors who insist on their own crazy, zany icon shapes with no respect for the consistency users value on their iPhone (round or other funky shaped icons with black backgrounds, I'm looking at you also). Deleted and goodbye.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-06 5
I love travelling and I use this app most of the time.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-05 5
Fantastic application.  Wonderful   Implementation.  Now that crash bug is fixed in v1.61.  Highly recommend.
Version 1.6.1 2009-10-05 5
As a photographer who is constantly travelling, this app has quickly become a good friend. I've been able to save a few bucks and valuable time using this app; so I highly recommend it to anyone. I would've gladly paid for this service; fortunately it's FREE!!
Version 1.6 2009-10-05 1
OMG..It crashes a lot.Fix it please.
Version 1.6 2009-10-05 2
Uhh yeah, this app drops me whenever I hit the search button. Automatic Fail. Really, Kayak???
Version 1.6 2009-10-04 1
Past versions with bugs and last one crashes on startup.
Version 1.6 2009-10-03 4
Just changed my rating because I just read about the 24hr bug. Otherwise works great and comes in very handy on road trips. Not giving it 5 stars because the hotel rates that come up for the same dates, etc. are less on hotels.com
Version 1.6 2009-10-03 1
Used to love this product, couldn't give it enough stars. Updated to the newest version, and now it keeps crashing. Correct this problem, and the rating will go back to 5 stars.
Version 1.6 2009-10-03 4
I usually travel to different countries,this app helps me alot
Version 1.6 2009-10-02 1
Can't search flights. Crashes!
Version 1.6 2009-10-02 1
Every time I tend to search for flights, it CRASHES !!!...tried uninstalling and re-installing...still of no use.
Version 1.6 2009-10-02 2
Bugs bugs bugs !!! They keep on updating the app but there's always bugs, it keep on crashing!!!!!
Version 1.5.1 2009-09-01 1
I downloaded the app and did a search and it was showing several different options and prices while the search was progressing but once the search was completed the page said no results found. However, at the bottom of the screen it said showing 464 of 464 results. Too bad! This could be a really good app if it didn't have this bug.
Version 1.5.1 2009-08-31 3
Great app but crashes too often. Work on this and the additional stars are yours!!
Version 1.5.1 2009-08-31 1
The name of my review says it all...Maybe the app should work before it's released...just a thought. Thank goodness it's free.
Version 1.5.1 2009-08-31 3
Needs rental cars too.
Version 1.5.1 2009-08-31 1
All I did was open app and searched for flights BUR to BWI. Saw AA flights then United as search progressed. Once it reached the end of search, all results disappeared and said no flights found. Huh???  Waste of time.
Version 1.5 2009-08-29 4
I have only had it for a short period of time, but the app is great for looking up and comparing airfare prices!
Version 1.5 2009-08-28 3
Great app, crashes often.  Please fix.
Version 1.5 2009-08-26 5
So much easier to use then the actual site if you are flexible and just want to catch a good deal!!! I wish there'd be one including cheaptix and cheapoair... Great job!!! For me it works really fast even on Edge network. Crashes rarely, not more often then any other app.
Version 1.5 2009-08-26 1
Good concept and UI.  Poor execution...hopefully next version will be better.
Version 1.5 2009-08-26 2
Crashes a lot.  You're better off going online.
Version 1.5 2009-08-25 1
I love the Kayak Website, but this app is very slow and unresponsive and crashes continually. Avoid it.
Version 1.5 2009-08-25 3
Nice app. Love the site, but this app crashes more than any other app I have.  How did this get through app store review?
Version 1.5 2009-08-25 5
I just booked a Christmas flight last week after comparing all the major travel sites but before downloading this app. I could have saved $30-$40 on airfare if I booked today using the Kayak app! It could just be timing and the dynamic nature of air travel, but this app showed cheaper options and seemed to work well.
Version 1.5 2009-08-24 1
Crashes the second I get search results.  It is much easier to use the mobile site online.
Version 1.5 2009-08-24 3
Not a bad app, they just need to get the crash problem worked out and it's a winner.
Version 1.5 2009-08-24 5
Thanks to this app I no longer have to be at my computer surfing continental flexible flights to get a good deal. Kayak is keeping me in the know.
Version 1.5 2009-08-24 5
It never crash and works wonderfully every time for me (im 3gs user fyi)
Version 1.5 2009-08-23 1
Crashes alot! Better off just going online
Version 1.5 2009-08-23 4
The best app I've downloaded so far. It's very useful. One suggestion though:  there shouldn't be a search limit. Other than that, the app is perfect, especially since it's free
Version 1.5 2009-08-23 3
Why is it when I search for hotels in New Orleans, LA, it returns with hotels in Greenburg, PA? A place where I have never been to nor searched for on this app or any app in my life?
Version 1.5 2009-08-23 5
Been looking every day for weeks to find a lower fare. Was out of the office and decided to check. And there it was. One single seat left. Thanks!
Version 1.5 2009-08-23 5
I've used Kayak for years, and now to have this as an app, this is Great...if you travel (flights, hotels, car rental), you WANT this app. Thanks Kayak!!
Version 1.5 2009-08-22 5
well written application, great reference, puts most travel information at your fingertips, and it's free.
Version 1.5 2009-08-22 5
Amazing app that removes the multiple layers of work when trying to find the best fares.  Love the trend button that lets you see where the best fares are heading. 

Great iPhone user experience!

Get it now that the crashing bug has been fixed!
Version 1.5 2009-08-22 5
Love it
Version 1.3 2009-05-29 3
Needs multi city feature
Version 1.3 2009-05-28 4
..but when it does, this app provides accurate, low-cost flight info, both international and domestic (U.S.) I've already used it to research my trip to the Ukraine in June and it found me a good flight for only $800 round-trip. Best I was able to find so far. Very good job folks. Beware of other, costlier apps that purport to find you cheaper fares but simply take you to Kayak!! Don't understand why this isn't a top-selling app...
Version 1.3 2009-05-26 4
This app has problems, but it does what I expected it to do.
Version 1.3 2009-05-25 1
Crash
Version 1.3 2009-05-24 1
Come on guys.
Version 1.3 2009-05-23 2
Please fix all the crashes. Then it will be a great app.
Version 1.3 2009-05-23 2
Very buggy
Version 1.3 2009-05-19 5
This has been a great app for me for searching for plane tickets. I don't know why other travel search engines don't have apps for the iPhone.
Version 1.1 2009-05-15 5
Great app
Version 1.1 2009-05-13 1
Free, sure, but regularly claims there is no internet connection or crashes - even after re-installing,
Version 1.1 2009-05-12 1
Does not connect to Internet, crashes frequently, and areas of the app just doesn't work. Don't waste your time until major upgrades are done.
Version 1.1 2009-05-12 1
Love Kayak on the web but this app is useless. Constantly get the message "no internet connection", whether on Wifi or 3G, after waiting several seconds with no activity wondering what it is doing. This could/should be a great app. please fix it.
Version 1.1 2009-05-11 1
Doesn't connect to the Internet. Waste of time. Fix it!!!
Version 1.1 2009-05-10 1
Conceptually it's an awesome app, however in reality it needs a lot of improvement at this point.  App is very buggy and freezes up a lot.
Version 1.3 2009-05-09 3
Only worked for about 10 mins. Keeps crashing, great app if it worked.
Version 1.1 2009-05-07 5
I revised my rating because the app hasn't crashed on me for awhile.  Now it is absolutely a five star app!!
Version 1.1 2009-05-04 1
This application doesn't connect anymore. It displays can't connect to the Internet no matter what every time. It was great when it worked but the application has been down for over a month now.
Version 1.1 2009-05-03 1
Worked well for a few weeks and then stopped working.  Could not even search for flights. When you tap on the Kayak app button nothing will open, tap again nothing happens, try again it opens, hit the flights button and the application stops.
When it did work for a few weeks it would not scroll properly and there was no option for nearby airports so you had to redo the flight search for the nearby airports.  
Do not know if you can even purchase anything since it never went that far into the booking process.
Have deleted the app but will reinstall since there may be an update but there have been no notices of updates.
Version 1.1 2009-05-02 1
What a shame. Used it once and uninstalled it. Web version returned 100 results, iphone app searches and shows none...
Version 1.1 2009-05-02 1
I so wanted to like this however it keeps crashing. The return date won't open, it won't recognize certain airports and it closes for no reason. Please fix this because I love the regular website!
Version 1.1 2009-05-01 2
Keeps crashing.
Version 1.1 2009-04-28 5
I am not sure why this app does not have a higher rating. It does exacty what it is supposed to. It finds you the cheapest airfares and let's you click off to the merchants site for purchase. I love it!
Version 1.1 2009-04-25 1
I typed in a popular airport and it came up with "no results!"
Version 1.1 2009-04-23 5
There was a bug. They fixed it. It now works like a charm. 

Uninstall your copy, reinstall it, and Bob's your uncle.
Version 1.1 2009-04-23 1
I use Kayak on a regular basis, but only from my computer because the iPhone version does NOT work. Very disapointing!!!
Version 1.1 2009-03-17 1
does not work.... yet maybe version two
Version 1.1 2009-03-17 3
I love kayak.com, unfortunately, the flight search doesn't work. Well, I think it works, but the rendering of listing the flights doesn't show up.
Version 1.1 2009-03-17 1
Love kayak.com but this app is horrible it crashes constantly! Your better off just going to kayak from safari then wasting time with this
Version 1.1 2009-03-17 5
Great app

Works great, can't wait to see what else they come up with.
Version 1.1 2009-03-17 5
Best travel prices app so far!
Version 1.1 2009-03-17 4
As a frequent road/air traveler I know this app will be superb when the frequent crashes and air search results are momentarily displayed and then hidden by message "No Results found". The hotel search appears to work well and I LOVE the filter! As I said before, the app will rock when the flights are fixed.
Version 1.1 2009-03-16 3
Hi, nice app, but crashes frequently. Could be enhanced by eliminating frequent crashes. Thanks kayak.
Version 1.1 2009-03-15 3
Big negative: no filter/search by departure time.
Version 1.1 2009-03-15 1
Love kayak but this app needs a lot of work.
Version 1.0 2009-03-07 4
Fast working app. The site show amenaties of the hotels for quick reference. Would have given it 5 stars if the connection to safari links were active.
Version 1.0 2009-03-06 5
And it finally came out. This is an amazing application and I use it all the time!

Highly reccomended.
Version 1.0 2009-03-05 5
Was waiting for either kayak or sidestep to release an app.  Has filter fields just like website does.
Version 1.0 2009-03-05 4
It's good for now. But it needs some updating. However it's the first try. I'll be looking for the update.
Version 1.0 2009-03-03 5
Love integration of phone numbers to book.
Version 1.0 2009-03-02 5
Best App. ever for the everyday traveler.  Down loaded it yesterday booked a Hotel today.  I Love the fact that they search Hotels as well as Flights.  Keep up the go work!!
Version 1.0 2009-03-01 5
I like that it connects me directly to airlines' sites and phone numbers.
Version 1.0 2009-03-01 4
I love Kayak's website.  This is just the app I was looking for!  I only wish it had the flexible dates search (maybe I didn't see it).  I love it!
Version 1.1 2009-03-01 5
I have used kayak for years awesome because it searches a lot of other sites for low fares
Version 1.0 2009-03-01 5
Very clean and easily usable. Exactly what I would expect from kayak. I imagine it will be very helpful when flights get cancelled.
Version 1.1 2009-02-28 1
A map function while viewing hotels needed.
Ability to filter by price range needed.
