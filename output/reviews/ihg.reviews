Version 3.3.1 2014-03-06 3
I love the application. It is very easy to use along with my IHG Card and Points. I have only had a few issues with IHG and the Holiday Inn Hotel brand. IHG eventually fulfilled the 2 Holiday Inn's that I had issues with commitments. I did spend several hours on the phone with IHG and countless emails to IHG to get the issues resolved, but after all of the time writing emails and on the phone with IHG, they did finally take care of the concerns. IHG as a whole is a great program, but getting the hotels to fulfill their obligations is another thing. Only because IHG took care of my needs am I still pleased with the program and applications, but I did consider joining another hotel brands rewards program. The only thing that this application and IHG needs to fix is the section where you send a message to customer service and it suppose to be 48 hours for them to get back to you. You immediately receive an email confirmation stating that they will contact within 48 hours to resolve your concern. I waited over 7 days on 2 occasions for a return email with a resolution. That when I ended up calling IHG to resolve the issue. The 1st time I was on the phone for over 1 hour with no resolution and the 2nd time it took about an hour and the representative did resolve my long standing concern.
Version 1.1 2010-05-30 2
I am dedicated to IHG as my preferred hotel choice and as a platinum priority club member I regret to report that this app suffers greatly. I have used the mobile site for a few years now and although it suffers as well, there are some very basic functions the web-based site offers that even then app does not  This app has great potential but here are the areas in which it must be improved before I will then become a dedicated PC app user:   The app does not allow you to use the credit card on file in your PC account - although password protected even my banking app keeps my account information stored. If you have bothered to sign up for an account , then you probably travel enough to understand the benefits of such an account and if you are a business traveler like i am, then most of the travel is expensed and probably on one credit card.  So having that card stores would be paramount for an edfective App.  Also, having to enter your email in multiple places is redundant and not to mention a pain on the go.  The site is wholly missing a REDEEM function - which is afterall the main reason for my loyalty. To make this a truly travel friendly app targeted specifically for PC members then there should be a function that will allow you to redeem points for free hotel stays as well. I will continue to be dedicated to IHG but would greatly appreciate an update to this version ASAP!
Version 2.03 2011-12-28 3
App works well to show available properties in virtually any area. However, there are no room or suite descriptions included. 

I recently booked a Crowne Plaza room expecting amenities comparable to Crowne Plazas where I stayed in the past. The property did not include all of the features, just higher prices. 

Priority Club Platinum status does not guarantee room upgrades but I usually make reservations one notch below the luxury room I can afford. If I have to stay in the room I booked, it is a discount. If an upgrade is available, it is better discount. Without room or suite descriptions, how do I know what to expect? 

The amenities listed on the cover sheet of each property are the amenities for all rooms and suites. What tells me a suite is worth more money per night than any other suite? 

I have not attempted the points redemption feature, but based on my usage of this app it does not offer enough details. 

Overall, the app looks and feels good in operation. However, it lacks too much detail to make it a stellar app.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-18 5
For 20 years I have traveled for business extensively and Holiday Inn and other IHG hotels have been my number 1 choice. Every property is consistent providing friendly service, clean and comfortable rooms, safe, and great rewards program that allows for down time on my schedule with no blackout dates. My experience is that if they error, and only a couple of time they did, IHG made it right.

If you want to have great experiences in lodging regardless of business or pleasure - download this IHG app and treat yourself to the best the industry has to offer with locations everywhere you need to go or where you want to be. Thanks IHG I love the way you have treated me for two decades!!
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-17 4
The app allows you to make reservation, provides decent information on the hotels, provides an overview of upcoming stays and your current account status (Gold Elite, points available, nights stayed etc.). The basics.

Now please add the option to rate/review my stay. I am making an assumption that my feedback is important to you (you are reading this, right?). You would like to improve the experience you offer and I have observations on what went wrong, suggestions for what could be better, and/or glorious praise and encouragement to keep up the good work etc. Let me do that from the app, and everything will be right in the world.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-20 5
Traveling as often as I do as a Regional Sales Manager,  this app allows me to book and manage my reservations on the road as I travel.  In an unfamiliar area?  Let the app find the closest IHG hotel and show the rate, room type, and within seconds make a reservation.  Many a time I have booked and shown up at the hotel 15-20 mins later.  Having reached Platinum last year, holiday inn is my oasis while away from home!  This app is well ahead if its time and has been my saving grace!  Many thanks to those that created this streamlined app!
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-11 1
Do not bother, use the full website. This app, and all it's revisions, have been a nightmare from the beginning!  Now, at least, it's streamlined into one app for all platforms, but do ANY of the developers ever actually try it out?  I'm pretty app-savvy, and it took me 15 minutes (out of curiosity, I had already given up and went to the full website to book a room) how to find out how to actually make a reservation!  Turns out, once you get to the hotel description, you have to click " get directions" to be directed to a booking page!  Who knew?!?  Sure hope this is a temporary glitch...also, description of app for iPad says to download the new version " with the plus sign". Great, only problem is none have one.  Who's running the IT dept?  My 78- year old mother knows better than this!
Version 1.1 2010-06-24 2
1. You can't book a room with reward points...isn't this an app for that program?

2. You can't read full titles of available rooms. So you may see two identical rooms at the same price but since you can't read the whole room description title you won't know which room is smoking vs non smoking. You have to goto their website to figure that out...and since you're there why bother using the app?

3. Credit card entry doesn't work!!!! You can enter type and number but the number pad won't go away and makes it impossible to enter expiration date. We tried this several times on different devices with the same results...makes you wonder if anyone tested this thing.

This app offers little benefit to Priority Club members
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-24 5
I am in Hotels 5 to 6 days a week with an average of 6 fights a week, city to city. My home away from home is the Holiday Inn and I appreciate my priority club membership and benefits.

 Thank you for your attention to the details no matter which of you locations I call home tonight. When I arrive to sign in no matter the time, my room temps are perfect and my breakfast is on time promptly 6AM the next morning. The staff is like having a team of personal assistants 24-7. 
You have earned a loyal customer weekly.
Sincerely,

James
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-24 4
The app is great. I use it all the time when traveling. 
It would be nice to have some aggregate results from a search though that can be seen at a glance. I should also be able to expand my search for farther down the road through the UI without having to know the location ahead of time. Sometimes I look farther ahead to find a better rate and will push my drive ahead. So to cater to the road warrior it would be a nice feature to maximize the search ability.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-05 5
If you travel a lot or a little this app had you covered. For those of us road warriors using the app is faster than using the website to book. Once you've signed into it you don't have to re-enter your info each time and can search, confirm and book in less than a min if you know where you're going and stay at the same places! This is a rare app that makes life easier, other apps wish they could be this useful.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-18 5
I book everything through my phone. I conveniently check the available hotels in the desired city and book with my points or credit card straight from my phone. It immediately sends a confirmation right in the App (which i usually take a screenshot) and also emails the confirmation. Have booked this way twice already n have not had any problems upon checking into my hotel. Its so simple its ridiculous.
Version 3.2 2013-11-07 5
I travel for a living and have been a longtime IHG Priority Member back when it was just called Priority Rewards. If I find my self away from home and need options for overnight stay, I simply open up the IHG app on any one of my Apple iOS devices and the nearest IHG hotels appear, almost instantaneously! Nice improvements with the digital card displaying the priority account number and current points balance!
Version 2.01 2011-07-26 4
My glaring concern is that the app displays my home address and personal information, along with my upcoming stays. In other words, if I lose my phone, whoever finds it will know where I live and exactly when I won't be home. PLEASE FIX THIS! UNACCEPTABLE. 

That concern aside, I travel ICH properties often and find the functionality of the app to be excellent. I book rooms with the app a few times a month when my plans suddenly change and it's great to know that I've secured a room with instant confirmation number.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-06 5
I practically live out of a suitcase bouncing around the country. The Priority Club iPhone app had proven to be a valuable tool. It provides quick and easy access to their reservation system. The app features an interactive map which makes their app better than anyone else's I have used. When checking in, I am always appreciated and made to feel welcome. Priority Club makes being away away from home a little easier.
Version 3.0.0 2013-06-30 5
Busy with every day life running alone here and there surely make a lot of stress and havoc but when u retire back after a job done so will you expect a comfortable relaxing stay with IHG hoetls .
 But sure you ll do cause IHG make sure your happy from beginning of booking till you  checkout from hotel no hassel no worries great app easy to use does not hung on you and make  you take complete control   .Great job
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-16 5
I love the fact that I can easily look up properties and choose the one in the location I want with the amenities I need all on my phone.  I've booked 3 road trips now using the app just by looking at the map and deciding where I want to stop and spend the night.  It's great to have my accommodations all set ahead of time.  Also if I want I can make a reservation last min using this app.  It has been a very useful tool for me.
Version 2.04 2012-03-08 4
I love this app, since I'm constantly traveling for work. There are a couple features I'd like to see added however. I'd like to be able to view my points history, in order to see the amount of points I received at each hotel and so that I can determine if points are missing. I am also a member of the Priority Rewards Dine program. So I'd love to see a feature on the map which allows you to locate restaurants in the program that are near you. Add these features and it's a 5 star app!
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-04 5
Great App! Very easy to use and super quick. It's better than the frustrating website. The only negative is that it does not give a detailed description of the different rate offers. For example, when a hotel is offering a rate package that includes a gas card or gift card, it will not tell you the value of the card. You have to go to the website to find that out. Other than that, no issues.
Version 3.3.1 2014-04-09 3
I stay 100+ nights a year in IHG hotels. This App is perfect for booking and managing existing reservations. I love that I have all the addresses, phones numbers of the hotels I've reserved. The last update messed all that up. Something broke in the last update and when I open up the address in maps it gives me am error about not finding a destination from my current position. I can be across the street and it can't find the address. It all started after the most recent update. Fix this bug and I can happily rate it higher.

Version 2.04 2012-02-04 4
Generally I like the app, but I would like to see a couple improvements.
First, it should include a comments section where I can make special requests, like on the full website.
More importantly, when I make a reservation from the app, and that reservation is modified, the app won't display the reservation anymore, even though it is still valid, and the same confirmation number.  Please fix it so I can see any reservation I have an active confirmation number for.
Version 3.1.4 2013-09-23 4
This is a great app that helps me when planning all of our travels. It is nice to be able to see where our "home away from home" hotels are available. It is super easy to book, and the only complaint that I have is that sometimes when booking one particular room, when I show up they have me booked for another room. This usually does not pose any problems, but sometimes we have had to pay more for the room that we initially booked.
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-19 4
I use this two to three times per week to make reservations. Works great, but please make the app remember frequent hotels and frequent cities like the web site did. Would make it much easier to use. Now if I am in one city and want to make reservations in another city I have to over ride the GPS and enter another city.  Usually I make reservations before I arrive in that city so I almost never use the GPS location finder, and mostly have to override it.
Version 1.0 2010-04-27 5
Having been a Priority Club member for 10 years, I was extremely happy to see that they have an iPhone app.  The app is great, gives me account details, let's me reach out to customer service and of course book a room (which I haven't done yet obviously but am looking forward to testing).

Great user interface too.  One recommendation, let me tweet out the offers to my friends!
Version 2.11.0 2013-01-24 5
Best hotel app out there! Easy to use, easy to navigate, current and efficient. I have never had an issue with this app for anything. Reservations are a snap and immediate. I have parked outside the hotel and made a reservation using points as well as paid reservations. In the time it takes to put my phone away and walk in to the hotel, my reservation was ready. This is flawless!
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-26 5
I travel for business often. Using this app has helped me stayed organized and focused on the bigger picture. It keeps all of my upcoming travel easily accessible, as well as in an order that is easy to understand. I give five stars because I also use this app to cash in points for weekend getaways. We always find a hotel where we want to travel!
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-30 5
I really like the App!!! I travel a lot and like to coordinate lodging close to my first Sales Call of the day...This App allows me to make last minute Reservations from my phone and keep on moving!!! It also allows me to scan my CC if I want to take care of that and make check in even quicker....I would imagine more improvements/enhancements are on the way.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-12 5
Anywhere I find myself with this App I find all the available hotels and rates for that area. The best part is being able to make my reservation immediately right on it and of course earning points for every dollar I spent is the icing on the cake. At the end of the year I end up with free nights to contribute towards my vacation. The reward points is great and the App is fantastic!
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-17 5
I was in Thailand and missed a ferry so my travel plans got screwed up last second.  Used this app and within a minute it found local hotels and booked one with my points... Really took the stress out of a situation that could have sucked.  I don't bother reserve rooms ahead much anymore- when I get somewhere I just open this and *bam* I'm booked.
Version 2.11.0 2013-01-26 5
I travel extensively in my job, and this app makes finding and scheduling a room a snap. It gives me choices in the geographic area that span all levels of service, from 3 star to 5 star level. The app is very intuitive and easy to navigate. I always receive instant confirmation and an email within minutes. This is an invaluable tool in my travel toolbox.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-07 5
I belong to several hotel clubs but Priority Club has the best benefits and rewards.  I am more loyal to IHG because of it.  I have stayed on rewards points in several very nice places--Hong Kong, Singapore,  etc. for points.  There are other ways to earn points and I do that too.  I like the app because it is so fast.  Holiday Inn Express Hotels are my favorite.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-18 5
In use this app nearly every week and can quite easily search my hotels for every trip. I actually prefer the app over the full site. The only thing I would like to see is an easier way to view the progress on offers. For example on the big win you have to log in to a different site. Otherwise, it's a great app!
Version 1.5.1 2010-11-01 4
Just wondering... I submitted a request for hotels in two cities in which only 1 popped up for both cities. Both hotels had "no availability." 
Question is:
Will the Priority Club Rewards app send me a notification if a room becomes available for the last 2 destinations I tried to book?
I bet not.
But, it would be great if I had the choice to recieve push notifications in the case a room became available.
Please look into!

Thanks!

Version 2.12.1 2013-03-25 4
The Priority Club is great. I have to travel for work and I stay at a Holiday Inn Express because it's the closest one to the workplace and the staff are soo friendly.  Then I went to Vegas gound out that the Venetian and Palazzo is part of the Priority Club so I got more points staying. 

As for the app, not the best. When I want to see more for rewards it takes me to the safari and have to re-login. App needs improving.
Version 2.10.1 2013-02-05 5
So this app is great. Where ever you end up in your travels you can hit a button and the app shows you hotels close. With in 30 seconds your back on the road. I often book hotels late in the day and this makes it super easy. For point hoarders there is an attached dining app to show you restaurants in your area where you can earn points too this app rocks.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-17 5
Great app to have if you love to travel on a whim. User friendly, convenient. Makes finding hotels closely easy. Always guaranteed to find a clean hotel most With free breakfast. Also can incorporate along your route and plan for a break. With so many locations, your sure to find one along most  highways!
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-17 5
This was a wonderful experience! This hotel is closing tomorrow as it has been bought by another company. The employees  here could have been bitter and not a care in the world since they are all out of jobs as of Sunday, but they have all maintained the most respect and customer service. It was a great stay!
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-28 5
Just took a vacation with the family, and the iPad app was fantastic.  Easy to find hotels, good pictures and info, and easy to book with credit card or points.  Uses the iPad interface well.  Hilton brand apps are not optimized for iPad and look like low res warmed over web pages.
Version 3.2.2 2013-11-23 3
Ok, so this is a great app and I'd choose to use it more often to book my hotel stays, if not for two things:

1) hotel search default to current location/date is really annoying. I don't know about you, but I usually don't wait until I am in a new city to look for a hotel for that night.!?

2)add reviews that are available on the main IHG website so one doesn't have to switch back and forth between a browser w reviews and this app to make a decision.

Thanks!!
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-08 5
Very good app when out and about. My favorite feature is the ability to see hotels with availability near by on a map. Works well no mater where in the world I am. The feature allowing me to book a reward night using the app is very useful for last minute reservations.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-19 5
I downloaded the app yesterday hoping to be able to easily reserve a room using points for the same day. I found it very easy to use, and quite feature rich. I was easily able to search in a particular area, book my room, and open directions to the hotel. Just what I was hoping for!
Version 2.13.0 2013-06-02 5
This app is great enough. Not awful but not the best. It's convenient and informative. I love how it keeps up with all my info and it all co located and available for my use. It makes the booking part of traveling a lot easier. It's best to just call the operator. They do everything for you, even call the hotel. GOLD REWARDS!!!
Version 3.2.3 2013-12-01 5
I like this a lot and use it quite often when traveling. The only thing I wish the would bring back is a larger visual of your membership number. Agent at the counters have a really hard time seeing the current tiny font of the membership number.  Other than that, this is a great app.
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-21 5
This app is so easy to use, whether you are planning a leisurely family vacation, or trying to find a hotel at the last minute during business travel.  You can price shop, compare hotel amenities, or simply find what hotel is closest to your points of interest.  I can't imagine travel without this app.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-05 4
Update to review: reset your location and privacy and the app works perfectly. 

The app is always using location services, even after exiting the app or force quitting. Kills the battery. No support through IHG as their reps have no clue how it works. Link for app support goes right to IHG mobile site with no contact button.
Version 1.0 2010-04-27 5
Been waiting for an app from Holiday Inn/Priority Club ever since I got my iPhone, and I'm glad they finally got one on here.  Great UI, a nice, clean, simple format, much like the website.  I'm lovin' it!  Only problem that I see for now is that you can't book a room with your reward points...but it's great for a first go-round.  Thanks guys!    
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-20 5
The convenience offered by this app is great for road-warriors. Changing reservations is done with a few clicks rather than several phone calls. 
It's like having a direct line to the reservation system without having to rely on a phone rep to do the same task.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-10 5
This app is great all the way around. It gives your reward balance. You can find hotels near your location. It lists the current reservations with hotel address which makes getting to your destination quicker to find after flying all day. This app is all around awesome!!!
Version 1.1 2010-06-19 3
If the developers read any of the review written since the "upgrade," they would realize there are more things to add to this app. Please make it more convenient to use by adding the things suggested by others! (i.e AAA rates, book rewards nights, save personal info option) If I'm driving, I don't want to have to look up everything! Apps are supposed to be timesavers! Great idea but needs some work yet. Hope to see another update soon because it is vacation time :-)
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-27 5
When I need to check a reservation, I use this app. When I need a room for the night because weather forced a flight cancellation, I use this app. When I wanted to use points for a mini-vacation, I used this app. If you want to stay in the ICH chain, this is by far the easiest way to do it.
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-20 5
I find this app to be great for me as I travel nearly everyday and most of the time pick my rooms on the fly. The app is very effective to get me all HI locations and pricing. As a Priority Club member all information is stored and simplifies reservations to a simple ok.
I use it almost everyday and just love it.
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-18 5
I hated logging in online every time. So I quit using it. And in between then and now- I've spent about 3000$ on rental cars for vacations. I see PCR has partnered with the rental company. I would've had thousands and thousands of points. But now I found the new app. Such a ease of use. Thank you. I wish I only had it sooner.
Version 3.2.2 2013-11-18 3
Thankfully the IC hotels are way better than this clunky app.  This app is basically what some other chains like Sheraton/Westin or Marriot have had for a few years.
They claim to have added  Passbook integration, but when I try it, it just hangs.  Anyway, it is an improvement over their precious super-crappy app, but still a bit embarrassingly behind the best ones.
Version 1.2.4 2010-09-20 2
Seems the app is broken ATM?  It won't get past the loading screen all of the sudden...

I agree with the other points brought up here regarding this app needing to remember your info, it's not a security feature it's a hassle to re-enter your info for every single reservation.  Especially if your billing and mailing addresses are different!

I use this app a lot to book stays for myself and my employees while I'm on the road,  PLEASE SAVE INPUT ENTERED!!!

If it was working, and it allowed you to save info, I would give it 4 stars.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-20 4
I have found that IHG is the best rewards program going.  Yes some of the Hotels are not as good as they should be, but, when you call guest relations they do every thing possible to make it right.  They are always knowledgeable about promotions and, are quick to point them out.  Overall my family has been very pleased with the hotel group of IHG.
Version 3.3.0 2014-01-06 5
This is a really good app

It has a lot of features and links you to the main IHG page if needed. This app is light years ahead of hilton honors pathetic app. Don't believe me? Try yourselves. 

I'm loyal to IGH because they are customer friendly and forward thinking. This app is proof.
Version 1.1 2010-05-09 3
I love almost everything about this ap. When I use the regular website from my phone or computer I have the option to have my personal info saved and preloaded. Yet when I use this "handy" on the go ap I have to enter my credit card info and email address (not once, but twice). Please Priority Club add a feature that will allow us to save this info under our profile. I want so badly to give you a 5 star rating. I just can't at this time.
Version 3.1.4 2013-09-26 5
The new IHG version of the Priority Club app is excellent.  Easy to use and very quick.  Only improvement I would suggest, is the ability for the app to rotate from portrait to landscape view rather than having to used exclusively in the portrait view.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-13 5
I'm a priority club member and this app is great for making reservations, checking upcoming reservations, and for keeping track of ur points! Great for traveling when you search a city it will show all IGH hotels on the map so you can book along your route.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-15 5
Great app. Easy to use, search, access hotel details, and book a room. Also easy and quick to use for reward points nights. Could use a few more search functions, but can always revert back to  web site if I really needed to refine search parameters.
Version 2.11.0 2013-01-27 5
This has to be one of the best hotel apps out there. It is easy to use and easy to find what you are looking for. I also like that they have the iPad app as well as an iPhone app. Plus you can find a hotel room that fits your style and budget within the IHG community. Absolutely wonderful!!!
Version 3.3.0 2014-01-20 5
So, this app is extremely user friendly, it updates your recent activity and lets you know your current reward points/status.  It also makes finding a hotel and many other related services simple.  Great app, I've had no problems with it so far.

Version 2.14.0 2013-06-24 5
I use this a lot and it's very easy to use. Priority Club is a solid rewards program, the best I've used on along term basis.  If you're a serious business traveler, this is a great app. It. Would also be helpful for casual family trips and planning but it works well for serious traveling.
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-14 5
I've been a member for many years and have been a Platinum Elite member for about four years. I used to fly for Continental Airlines and signed up for every hotel rewards program I could. Here we are today and IHG(Priority Club) is the ONLY one I use. Love this program!!
Version 3.3.1 2014-01-29 5
This app allows me access to my points balance, member card, finds hotels, allows me to book and even grants access to the IHG dining club. Of all the apps on my phone, this one is by far the best designed for getting things done on the go!
Version 3.3.1 2014-02-04 5
I travel all over the country and on a consistent basis the IHG brands are the most well kept and always the greatest service.  They put more money into the renovation of older locations.  The only criticism I would give is that the gyms are not the best compared to other brands.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-16 5
This chain of Hotels  is consistently terrific. I have never had a bad stay at any of the properties and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone. The Intercontinental hotels are beautiful all the way down to the Holiday Inn Expresses. The membership rewards club is very easy to use.
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-13 5
This app has saved me time and again. Being able to quickly secure a reservation wherever I happen to be at the time is easy. The app knows where I am, where the nearest hotels are, what my preferences are, and lets me make the reservation I need in no time.
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-12 5
I stay in hotels 4-5 nights a week the entire year.  I'm constantly on the go and in a different hotel every night too, so having an app as good as this is a must.  It's seriously easier and better than going online to their website for booking!  And it's miles beyond the Hilton app.
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-08 5
On a recent road trip (April, 13) we were, as Priority Club members, able to search, make reservations, book rewards nights and cancel a reservation while driving. App worked every time. Highly recommended for Priority Club users.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-11 5
As a frequent traveler, I use this app several times a week. It is been very helpful for making reservations seeing my point status, and just finding what locations are available when I'm in different states.
Well worth it easy decision.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-19 5
I love this app! It makes booking so easy at any IHG property around the world. I like the fact that this app allows for anyone to monitor PC points. Rewards night booking is very easy. Definitely an amazing app! Much easier than any other hotel rewards program app!
Version 3.2 2013-10-29 5
With the integration of passbook this is absolutely the best hotel app on the market. Have they added my priority club card but also my current reservation. This makes me want to start staying at Holiday Inn again.
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-19 5
Great application I have used weekly and it has always helped find a good hotel close by very fast. It also tracks your reservations and I have had situations searching for confirmation numbers. No longer needed, it's all here. Enjoy
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-19 5
Love this app for road trips, last minute itinerary changes and multitasking in airport check in lines!   Also like that they've added Dine tool so I can find restaurants to earn points for free hotel rooms when I'm looking for a place to eat anyway.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-01 5
As a priority club member that travels frequently for both work and personal reasons this app really comes in handy for searching hotel locations and amenities and doing last minute booking. Extremely convenient and easy to use.
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-13 5
Combining all of the services on the new IHG App has really improved the services. On a recent east Coast trip having this application made locating stops much easier. The consistency of the IHG properties takes a worry out a looking for a good nights sleep.
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-21 5
This app is great. You can book by credit card or book by rewards. It keeps your priority # right there in case you don't have your card handy. Plus via messages you can see upcoming promotional items.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-19 5
This app is great !  Found a room near our destination on a holiday weekend, and only a few clicks later I was all set.  Very convenient and highly recommended.  Priority club knows how to treat customers you won't be disappointed !
Version 3.2.3 2013-12-01 5
This app is very well made. My favorite thing about the IHG app is that it features a map of the city with all the IHG Hotels labeled. This allows me to research MUCH easier. The pictures have easy access and the description of each hotel is very accurate to the reviews. MUST HAVE APP FOR IHG LOVERS.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-20 4
app is wonderful, but just like the webpage I can't get the site to STAY on USD when I look at hotels overseas. It wants to default to the local currency. I don't know why. I still think and use USD because of where I live. You should have the option to set a currency to whatever you choose as the default.
Version 2.11.1 2013-01-29 4
Has saved me much time during hectic travels.  Whether its getting a room quickly, checking when and where I am staying or canceling due to travel changes, its ready.  It could have more functionality towards the Rewards part. Just seeing your points is a little narrow scoped.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-29 5
This application is great it's so easy to use and convenient.  It lets you know how many points you have its easy to find and book rooms and keep track of your reservations.  It's a great application don't hesitate download it.  I  use an iPhone 4S works great
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-19 3
The app is nice and simple by it does not let u really look at your own profile.  When it searches for the hotel, you can see the reviews if the hotels.  While I think the app makes a lo of inroads it is missing some important features that most would look for when booking a hotel (i.e. reviews, vital info such as restaurant, bar, biz ctr, etc...
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-03 2
The app could easily rate 5 stars if when searching you could search for amenities. I love how easy it is to search and book rooms, including rewards nights straight from the app.  However, we have 2 dogs we frequently bring with us.  I have to find hotels on the app, then switch to Internet browser to pull up the hotel website to see if pets are allowed.  Double work makes me not want to use the app!
Version 2.11.1 2013-04-22 5
This app is EXCELLENT for finding and booking a hotel while you're on the go. We never know how far we'll drive in a day, and this app makes it super convenient to see what hotels are just down the road, no matter where you are.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-25 5
I love IHG hotels! They always have a friendly staff, super clean and modern, and great value!! Priority club is the best rewards program that I've seen - and I travel a LOT for work so I'm always searching for rewards. Join the club and start staying!!
Version 2.0 2011-06-09 5
I travel alot and stay at alot of different hotels. This app is by far the fastest and easiest app to use out there. I have actually been a block from a Holiday Inn used this app to book a room and that room be ready with my gold upgrade by the time I got to the hotel! 

Bravo Guys!
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-14 4
This newer version is so much easier to use. Navigation is simple and the reservations are easy to look up. The only complaint I have, is sometimes the rewards room availability on the app is different from the actual full website. So check both before booking.
Version 3.0.2 2013-12-02 5
This makes reserving a hotel on the fly, whether with my points or credit card, so easy that I could cry when it's an otherwise hectic day. Perfect for business travelers looking for a practical tool.
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-25 5
This is app is fast and easy to search and book a hotel anywhere. My job has me on the road a lot so this app has saved me the hassle of calling hotels and giving credit card numbers while on the road.....definitely recommend!
Version 2.05 2012-05-11 4
I was able to quickly find all the Holiday Inns in Shanghai, scan available rooms, reserve with cc. Offline version would be nice but I understand why they don't do it. Would be nice to be able to see and write comments about individual hotels; I imagine the boss would also like such a feedback loop.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-14 5
Have used this app countless times to book hotels while traveling and while at home. Can't think of anything it needs to improve on - so I give it 5 stars. If you're in priority club, you must have this app.
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-09 5
I do most of my reservations using this app.  I almost always stay in IHG hotels so it USA great way for me to check availability and book rooms.  I also like the fact I can check on my upcoming reservations and find directions.
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-14 5
This app make everything easier, booking rooms while you travel, tracking points and checking on future reservations.  The best part is, I can do it all from my mobile phone.
Version 2.12.1 2013-04-05 5
Using the Priority Club Visa for all our every day shopping we've accumulated points quickly. We pay off the Visa every month and get a lot of free nights. A nice bonus is the points never expire.
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-09 5
The update took time for me to like but it's workable.
I'll never understand the need to take away priority club name the most loved name and site for travelers. 
IHG isn't exactly in the class as a name for the best hotel program in the world.
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-22 5
Opens to welcome me and show my points -- and it's pretty.  Digging in I find my upcoming stays, or search for a room, or whatever, all the functions I need pretty much where I'd expect them to be.  Nice. 

Wish they had a place in Maui.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-27 5
Each stay at a Priority Club facility has been nothing but excellent. My family and I are always treated with courtesy and respect. When we have made changes we have not been hassled about the change.
Big Tex
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-13 4
Good App, but I wish that it would flip to landscape mode...yep, that's pretty picky, but also pretty basic.  Maybe that will be a future update?  I've been using the Priority Club Apps for years on both my iPhone and iPad and it does keep getting better.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-09 2
This app used to work very well and I use this product in my travel, however, the confirmation page does now not show complete information. As far as I can see, there is no way to cancel or change a reservation. Also, no confirmation E-mail is sent as is normal. I need a confirmation E-mail for my employer.  The app in not useable now. Please fix this as soon as possible. As a Gold Elite IHG member, I need this app!!!!
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-26 5
From the app, you can make a reservation, which is instantly transmitted to the hotel. You can also review or cancel your existing reservations, as well as view your points balance. Easy to use.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-20 5
I love IHG hotels and routinely have excellent experiences when staying there. This app has come in handy multiple times when I needed information about a reservation or needed to find a hotel. I highly recommend IHG!
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-31 5
so easy to use! it's the only way I book hotel stays, and keeps track of all upcoming reservations. Always shows best pricing for each room style and easy to use rewards points. Love this app!
Version 3.2.2 2013-11-26 5
Whether booking a room in advance or on the go this app works great. Map feature helps me find hotels closest to my route or destination. Just one more reason why IHG is my go-to hotel choice.
Version 3.0.2 2013-08-24 4
I use this app often, virtually every week for business travel. The only suggestion I have for an improvement would be access to my favorite hotels and cities. I would also like to be able to book another stay at the same hotel. Please add favorites!
Version 3.0.0 2013-08-02 5
So easy to keep up with my points, resevations at a glance. Also make reservations on the fly plus look up hotel website to get all the facts about the hotel you are going to be staying.
Definately 5 stars in my book!
Version 3.3.0 2014-01-15 5
The displaying of hotels on map is so useful when determining the one to cheek in. But the UI is still a little bit worse than that of SPG. Hope the member card can be added to the passbook as well.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-14 5
Able to book reservations easily, like the call from iPhone feature, directions with apple maps would be an improvement but google is good now that app is back.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-10 5
Very easy to navigate, and very useful. A little more access to my account for reviewing points and such is all I would suggest, but I only review that stuff for fun anyway.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-20 5
After a few glitchy efforts, this app does everything I need seamlessly!   Find and book rooms, lets me choose points or cash payments and keeps track of all my reservations!! Nice job !!!!
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-05 4
Easy to find and book hotels on the go. I travel a lot for work and have made several reservations from the road.

I would like it if they fleshed out the app more, for example being able to redeem rewards for merchandise. But by far the best hotel brand app.
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-15 5
Great app. Easy to use. I love being able to find a hotel while traveling by using current location instead of having to search each city. Also love all the details it gives regarding each hotel.
Version 1.1 2010-05-15 3
Useful features for accessing hotel and account information while traveling. Definitely not a substitute for using a browser to book or change reservations. Can cancel a reservation but can't change it to a different date. Upcoming reservations are not listed in chronological order. Other missing features noted by previous reviewers.
Version 2.12.1 2013-04-20 5
Priority club is great. I have used many reward nights. There are tons of other rewards to chose from other than nights as well. Have never had a problem with the app and I use it to book regularly.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-08 5
This app provides a much more improved user experience to book and view your reservations, view your reward activity.
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-25 5
My husband and I have done a lot of traveling the last week. This is only app I've used to book motels. It is easy to use and efficient. Motels have been great, hospitality awesome! And we are earning points! Thanks!
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-14 5
I'd been using the older version on my iPhone 3 and recently upgraded my phone. The newer version improves on the older one, which I used a lot. Great for checking the hotel address when you're on the way!
Version 3.0.0 2013-06-29 5
This app is incredible, I use it daily to help with my reservations. The information on hotel locations, amenities, and availibility help me efficiently and swiftly get my R&R taken care of. Thanks a lot! Great app!
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-19 5
Makes scheduling my travels for the week simple.  Easy to
Find hotels, check rates & specials, then stores reservations so I can figure out where I'm headed each night.  Simple to use, way better than Hilton's.
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-17 4
Crashes when you open it!  When it works its very useful and highly recommended for any priority club member.  There's not much to it but its a good app to have and I use it weekly.  There is so much more they can do with this app, so it bodes well for future updates.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-18 5
I have yet to stay at a bad holiday inn and I think their app shows the attention to detail they show at when you arrive for a stay. Only thing I would add is the ability to book a room through the app.
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-10 4
This app is a must have when you're traveling.  I loved it...it was so easy and user friendly. I would recommend this app for everyone to use.  I would say when you have to edit the dates on your reservation, it wasn't there so I had to cancel one room and rebook it.
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-14 4
I would have given 5 stars if they would fix some of the bugs and make more user friendly for rewards members. Hard to navigate and find what your looking for other than booking a room. But it works fast and easy for booking!
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-26 5
This app has never left me sleeping in the cold. It works well and works when I need it. It also functions advertised. Even so, there are a few features that it could use, like a favorites, or recent stay function.
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-16 5
Most of these reviews must be fake.  There is no benefit to this app vs the website.  Every time you attempt to do anything it takes you to the website and makes you log on again.  Complete waste of time.
Version 2.09 2012-10-21 3
The app as a whole is pretty good. Improvements: Map mode needs to utilize the existing map on the iPhone (like it used to). It's nice to accumulated points, but would be really great to have a section to see when & how many points are accumulated by date. I had a few more, but can't think right now. Will repost when remembered.
Version 2.11.0 2013-01-25 4
Didn't really use the app to book or something, just to keep track of my points. I think it might have a small bug coz when u exit the app the location service arrow remains (status bar iphone 4 5.1.1). In the settings-location services i confirm that it is the one using it.
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-04 5
Great app and a useful one that lets you book your stay on the go.   The great features such as the map locator and the sort by distance let you manage your choices in selecting your hotel.  Great effort IHG!!!
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-14 5
Great app for the seasoned traveller in need of booking hotel rooms on the fly. Even better for those loyal Holiday Inn Priority Club members quick access to all you profile data and points balances.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-07 5
Great rewards program, great hotels. All IHG brands are full of value added features that make business travel easier and leisure travel more enjoyable. Stick with IHG and the mutual benefits will endure!
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-24 5
Three words, "ease of use." This app is so user friendly, I can navigate around easily throughout and have immediate access to availability as well as my current reward standing.
Version 2.11.1 2013-01-30 5
Takes some to get used to, but is a great app to use.  Sitting around a restaurant and the other half says "let's go someplace, this weekend"?  Make a reservation!  Check you points!  Even cancel if you want to.
Version 3.2 2013-11-01 4

Version 2.11.1 2013-03-03 5
I use this app every week when I travel. Shows hotel locations on map with availability. I love that its so easy to use. I can literally book a stay in less than a minute most times. Love it!
Version 3.0.0 2013-08-24 4
Works real well when you are traveling and need to know what is available in location.  Would be better if it could look at a route and give you hotels and distance from where you are at. Better than most other hotel Apps.
Version 3.2.1 2014-01-25 5
Most of the upper end brands of this organization provide excellent customer service making your visit very comfortable place to stay.
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-07 5
Love that you can see bookings immediately after making them, plus points you'll receive. It's easy to search for future stays, too.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-13 5
I travel quite a bit for my Organization. I get an assignment. I look where I am going. Call for reservations, my card is already on file. Wait 10 minutes or less and I have an email and my stored stay.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-12 5
This app is easy to use and very helpful to be as a Gold member. See all of the venues available and rates is awesome. When my motorcycle club is travel I use the app and I'm always the first one done and completed!
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-11 5
I often need to change plans and so the Priority Club App is perfect. Within seconds I can reserve a room to stay over an extra night or even reserve a room en route. Perfect for my work schedule.
Version 2.13.0 2013-05-03 5
This app is simple and straight-forward. It does its job well. As a PC member, I've tried using other sites and apps to find better deals, but seldom do. I almost always wind up coming back to this app.
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-08 5
Great app, I travel for business quite a bit and at times need to find a last minute hotel and always use this app, especially when traveling for personal and business.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-19 4
I have only had 1 problem when using this app. It happened when checking in to my hotel for the night. The hotel didn't show a res for me, but the staff at the holiday inn express in cotulla tx got it fixed for me and even upgraded my room!
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-03 5
This has been very helpful for me to schedule and/or change reservations on the fly.  It always offers choices on rates and the best rewards program around!  5 Stars easy!
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-02 5
Excellent app that updates real time. Would like to see an IPad version. I really like the additional point earning opportunities that pop up at each hotel. Will eat in the hotel Restaurant for 1,000 pts anytime.
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-17 5
Easy to book. Accurate. Helpful and resourceful. Makes it so much easier to book last minute plans with the ray rewards program available in the travel industry! A+++
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-11 5
I always use this app to make my hotel reservations I like how they have bonus points for making the reservation on the app and it uses your location to find the closest hotel to you
Version 2.12.1 2013-04-07 4
Nice app but I could not see how to book using points for a vacation to PR and I am a platinum status member.

My wife loves the app as she can see the photos of resorts and pick the places we holiday. In the update, let me set my favorite vacation spots and set a default location
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-15 5
I've been a member since 2004.  Love the upgrades for rooms when you are at a certain level.  Se hotels have members night cocktail gatherings.  Appreciate the extra VIP treatment I get.
Version 3.2 2013-11-09 5
We have been traveling down south.  Stayed in savannah, Daytona beach and st augustine.  Every place was friendly, clean, and the rooms were lovely.  Would recommend to anyone.   Had a great time.
Version 3.5.0 2014-05-01 5
I've tried May hotels, but the IHG chain has really stood out for me.  Great reception, clean and comfortable rooms, and a solid reward system.  Unless I'm proven wrong, I will remain a loyal customer.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-07 4
Gives me all of my rewards club account information. Shows all booked reservations. Integrates with passbook and easy mobile booking. 
Plus, it stays signed in! No need to enter a long passcode every time I open the app.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-09 5
Use it pretty much everyday throughout Southwest Region.. Very convenient to use in areas where cell coverage is poor as it can quickly book rooms at very short notice
Version 3.1.4 2013-11-01 5
This app actually works great; one of the few apps for travel that can replace its full size PC screen user experience. I use this to make reservations, get directions etc. I love it.
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-30 5
This is a real convenient way to track account status and book new hotel stays.  It's great for keeping up to date with points that never expire and can be used for stays at really nice hotels.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-22 5
I travel for work often and this app is my first stop when booking or checking reservations. Book in seconds!
Version 3.2.1 2013-11-22 5
I have been using this app for about 9 months now and have has no issues after the initial bugs were fixed about 6 months ago.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-18 5
If you are, or are thinking about focusing upon IHG hotels, this app is a great tool. It came out while I was travelling in Europe on a flex schedule and was a great tool to make my trip flow.
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-13 4
Super handy for last minute reservations! As long as you keep the website updated with your current information makes reservations and viewing/changing your current reservations is quick and easy.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-08 5
I believe Apple build the iPhone and iPad around the Priority Club App. This app revolutionized the world on how to book hotels.  Not enough stars to rate how happy I am to be an end user of this awesome app.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-17 5
Use it to track membership points and make all reservations. Also helpful
In tracking future reservations.
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-01 5
This is so easy to use. Very user friendly and intuitive. It's easier and faster to book hotels on the app than on a laptop! It's also handy for keeping track of your reservations and points. Nicely done.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-22 5
Been a priority club member for over 30 years. Love the app. Keeps everything well organized and makes everything easy when I travel on business or pleasure.
Version 2.10.1 2013-02-03 5
I love checking to see how many points I have earned. And this app is quick and easy access to find a hotel and see Ido about it, along with a few other things.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-22 3
It's very difficult to navigate this app.  Would like to be able to put in my destination without having to start at current location and change.  I dont aait until I am in location to book.  Also need to be able to access corporate rates using special codes.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-22 5
Quick and easy to find and reserve rooms using rewards points or credit card. Can also check my club points and transactions.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-25 5
I have always had good stays and clean rooms.  Easy reservations, check-ins and service.  I travel around 36 weeks out of the year and it is nice to know that my down time is going to be relaxing.
Version 3.2.3 2013-12-02 5
This is a great app for those that are on vacation or traveling to make planning easy. Eliminates the need for printing out confirmations and emails because it right there on your app!
Version 2.11.0 2013-04-14 5
This app does it all. Easy to find and book a hotel in 3 clicks in any location. I can manage my account and redeem my points easily as well!!! A+++++++
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-17 5
Found this app to be intuitive and easy to use.  Was able to see my PCR points, book a hotel room and see my conformation # without any problems.
Version 3.2 2013-11-14 5
Easy to make online reservations and front desk attendants are always courteous and make you feel like they genuinely appreciate you staying at their hotel!
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-12 5
The priority club app is very easy to use and user-friendly. I like being able to book a hotel by the touch of a finger on my smart phone. They always offer the best deals around!
Version 3.2.3 2013-12-05 5
Great app, I use it 2-4 times a week to make my reservations. I'm usually already checked in by the time I get to the hotel. Highly recommend it to use with all IHG properties.
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-30 5
This is great app and works wonderfully.   I book almost all my hotel reservations through this app except when staying at hotel outside of this chain.
Version 2.05 2012-04-21 1
Trying to book / look for a hotel to a place when you're about to board plane? FORGET IT! Only works once you are in-country. Have to go to the website to check international locations. Doesn't link to the IHG Website to even store your favourites so you can rebook a hotel you've lived at the past four months! About as useless as I can't think without out-of-area hotel search/book functionality. If I was driving everywhere, this would be the bee's knees. But for me... Pffft!
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-09 5
I travel quite a bit so I appreciate consistently great service in the brand- and that confidence combined with a solid rewards program keeps me a loyal IHG customer.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-08 5
Very user friendly app - easy to find and book, and easy to find special deals! I've always preferred priority club/IHG over the other hotel rewards.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-07 5
Of all the apps available, I use this one more than any. It is great to be able to book a hotel on the go and not worry about anything. Never has failed! And priority points are excellent!!!
Version 2.14.0 2013-07-30 5
This app does exactly what it needs to and finds hotels for me on a regular basis.  Use your priority rewards or book by credit card and its fast and easy.
Version 3.3.1 2014-02-27 5
Easy to use, all the information in one place 
Easily make reservations with map feature , points balance and rewards
Version 3.2.2 2013-11-26 5
Excellent app for anyone.  I travel a lot and the ihg app allows me to find hotels quick and easy!  It's also nice to use it to book my hotels for the extra points!
Version 2.11.1 2013-01-30 3
Everything I'd expect, and see in other competing reward program apps...except Passbook support.  The ability to add a Passbook card for my hotel reservation-- with confirmation number that would pop up as I approached the hotel would make this app stand out and 5 stars.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-04 5
Well done with the rewards night function. We were driving and needed a place to stay and the reservation was confirmed as we were getting off the freeway. Very convenient.
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-07 4
Very easy to book a room, I travel almost every week for work and stay with Intercontinental hotels most of the time. The app is easy to use and gives you the info you need about your reservation and account.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-09 3
Great app! The map view makes it super easy to find a hotel where YOU want to be! Word of caution though -- be sure to check what rate you're signing-up for! Not all of them are pay-upon-arrival! I've gotten slammed on that before due to wording being confusing. Otherwise, great app! Clean design and awesome features!
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-03 5
Great app. Can make my reservations in a snaps. Only thing I would like to have is different rate options that show when booking online.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-27 5
I've used this app a few dozen times and have never had a problem. Screens are easy to navigate and I can always find the information I need.
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-21 5
This app makes it very easy to make reservations and organize them when all you have available is a smartphone.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-26 4
This app is very easy to use and convenient, especially with the Passport feature.  Would give 5th star if it had better interactivity with other parts of the program, such as the dining rewards.
Version 3.0.0 2013-06-29 5
Love staying at these hotels when traveling, and this app makes it so much easier to find and book just the right room to stay in.  Great job!
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-24 5
Just spent five days at the Intercontinental Miami. Beautiful. Staff was awesome as usual, and my points were already visible on the app hours after my stay was over. Top of the line.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-19 5
Priority club is the best by far, of all the reward style clubs! Been on several nice vacations and room didnt cost me a dime due to the points i used! Love it thanks priority club
Version 3.0.2 2013-08-25 5
Love this site. Quick and accurate search response. Love the map that shows hotels close by. I highly recommend both the app and website.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-18 5
I travel a lot for work, and this app makes my reservations and getting new information very easy! Not to mention, it's impossible to lose my reward card..
Version 3.2.4 2013-12-24 5
Good to book a quick reservation. Limited things can be done on the app but I think that is by design so as to keep it simple and easy to use.
Version 2.09 2012-11-28 3
While the app is great for booking and managing my reservations, it still bothers me that they have failed to adjust for the change to the new Maps app.  I do rely on that feature to pull up my location to start nav guidance to the hotel.  As someone who spends 140+ nights a year in hotels, this is very important to me.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-20 5
This app is fantastic.  If only the IHG customer service number could be as good. Long wait time if you want to speak to someone. Must be by design.
Version 2.11.0 2013-01-24 5
I travel a lot and this app is so much easier to use than Hilton Honors or Marriott. I stay at the Holiday Inn Family of hotels 90% of the time and this app makes the decision a lot easier. Keep up the good work.
Version 2.08 2012-10-02 4
I pretty much live in hotels due my my work environment and use this app all the time.  It it had the ability to put in a Corporate ID I'd give 5 stars.  Works well and this is all I use.  I go out of my way to to stay at one of these hotels just for the points!  Love it!!!
Version 3.3.1 2014-02-10 5
When I travel, I always stay at an IHG property, great app has everything you need to find an available hotel near you.  Intuitive and fully functional.
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-10 5
Makes hotel searching and booking a breeze ! Fast ! Addresses phone numbers photos all at your fingertips. Easy to read maps included! Excellent app ! A+ 5 stars
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-07 5
Valuable app for the traveler who needs flexible options.  Easy property locator, and booking is a breeze.  Highly recommended!
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-15 5
This app performs well and is convenient to use and book.  Hotel descriptions and bookings are easy to navigate like the online site.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-03 3
My measure is simple. Is it useful? Is it intuitive. This app is both.

Lately, inexplicably, reservations made with the app get cancelled the day of or day before arrival. 

This is a new but troublesome glitch. MAKE SURE to confirm your reservation as the date approaches  you mig be sleeping your car.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-05 5
This app is designed with frequent travelers a in mind. Very easy to use yet very functional.

Love the special notification! Really make me feel like a VIP!
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-25 5
I love how this app keeps you logged in and instantly pops up your points balance and hotels near your location. Redeeming your reward points couldn't be easier. Love it!
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-29 4
Easy to quickly find local hotels. They have 1 issue that hasn't been resolved is that they have rates listed at some hotels that don't explain what is included beyond the room like "road warrior package"?
Version 2.09 2012-12-23 2
App needs to allow user to be able to shop using Reward Points other than the Rewards Nights use. This is nice that they allow you to use this feature, but there are a lot of other things you can get with the Rewards Points (Gift Cards, Shopping, etc).  I agree with everyone else's statements about this app as well and that it why I am giving it such a low rating.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-15 5
The Priority Club App gives me instant access to all the features I frequently use, and need for booking rooms and checking points!
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-04 5
Very convenient to be able to find hotels and book them right from your phone. Highly recommend this app!
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-03 5
Love this app! Traveling cross country has never been easier! Only thing I would include is whether or not hotels allow pets since we travel everywhere with our beloved puppy!
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-31 4
I love the app. Simple, tells me my balance, let's me book rooms quickly, and one of the FEW things that are actually simpler to do on a phone than a pc. Just wish the hotel prices were a little cheaper. Not a knock on the app though...
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-10 5
This this app is the most helpful app out there! Easy to find a hotel with vacancy and amenities you want when traveling almost anywhere!!! Two thumbs up!!
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-30 5
I love The app. It makes booking a room and tracking the reservation so easy! Planning a trip is nice when you can see where the closest hotels are to the attractions.
Version 1.1 2010-05-15 4
My favorite hotel chain finally released an app. Nice and useful to track points and look for hotels. Did not give 5 stars because it is not retaining info when you make multiple reservations. Hope they will fix this in next version.
Version 1.1 2010-06-02 3
But not a great app. It works well, but only gives a subset of available rates. I was going to use it today to book a room, but booked online instead to save $$. I guess it would be good if you are desparate to make a reservation on the road from an iPhone, but I only have an iPod and if I can get WiFi for iPod, I can get it for my laptop too.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-20 5
Took a little bit to get used too!  But able to navigate and like the website layout. Having trouble signing up extra rewards and specials.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-14 5
I love priority club and the app makes it easy to book whether your tracking for work, vacationing or using your points
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-14 5
Love the ease of booking, cancelling, or anything with my priority club app. The older I get the grumpier I get with dealings on the phone. tapping and swiping with my finger is pain free. Thanks!
Version 2.12.1 2013-04-16 5
Great app for business travelers.  You can easily check points balance and find hotels in the Holiday Inn brand family.

I couldnt use the previous version, but this version finally lets me use my Corporate ID to get my special business rates. I will be using this a lot for business travel.

Continual refinement has paid off.  It is easy to use.  You can make, modify and cancel reservations with ease. It is a godsend for road warriors all around the world. This app makes the hotel reservations part of travel planning a snap.
Version 1.2.4 2010-09-11 3
Do you carry your Priority Rewards user name/pin everywhere with you? Me either. Do you carry your iPhone with you everywhere? Me too. Too bad I downloaded the app and found it completely unusable until I could get access to my user name and pin info.
Version 3.2.4 2014-01-03 5
Great for planning my travel the following week!!! That combined with the IHG MasterCard and I've racked up over 200,000 points in <10 months!!!
Version 2.11.0 2013-02-06 5
Incredible how convenient it is to book and stay at Holiday Inn around the country.  The hotels are clean, good service and top-notch for business class accomodations.

This app makes a constant travelers life much easier. I live out of hotels 4-5 nights a week and seldom have any issues finding a good room. I love this app.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-07 5
Awesome app. Traveling all over Florida and the Southeast hasn't let me down yet. Auto login makes it a snap to get on and get a room no matter where I am. Perfect for the road warrior member!
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-23 5
Super convenient, allows you to book a hotel anywhere in seconds. I really like the credit card scanning feature.

Works very well, stays up to date with points and the map system makes finding hotels easy.

All apps should be this easy, no meandering through different detours. You want a room, you find a room, you reserve a room.

They've fixed the location always on bug and now it's fantastic! Love that it keeps me logged in so I don't have to reenter anything to view my points balance.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-27 5
Priority Club Rewards is the only travel rewards program that has ever affected my travel plans.  This app is a useful face for the program.

The below comment from "Diamond in the Rough" is spot on! Thanks for taking the time to itemize the list. Completely agree with your comments!!

Version 3.0.0 2013-07-29 4
I haven't made a reservation yet, so I'm holding the 5th star for that experience since the previous versions had some shortcomings.   But until then, IHG got this right.  A great place to stay, and a good app to support that.
Version 3.3.0 2014-01-07 4
Great app keeps track of all my reservations in one place. Finding hotels easier than website is. Only hold back is sometimes the price is different than the site for long stays. Fix that plz.

I was excited to see the release notes that this update included passbook support. However, the app just spins indefinitely after clicking on the "Add To Passbook" button for an upcoming reservation, and the card is never added.

Adding a membership card works, just not adding upcoming reservations .

Anything from making reservations from an airport to checking on your current reservations. Perfect.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-31 5
The app is overall quite good. Basic needs are met. One thing they need to add is the ability to redeem points for items other than rooms.
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-15 3
Crashes upon opening on iPhone 5 with latest iOS software.

Once that's fixed, adding Passbook support for upcoming reservations would be a nice addition. As well as being able to see a virtual version of your membership card.

I actually use it more than the web page, just needs a few more advanced features...like being able to book with points & cash, would make it perfect!!
Version 1.1 2010-05-31 3
It picked up all my membership information except the credit card on record.  I do not like entering that info when  I'm traveling--it poses security risks when on wireless in public environments.  Need to pick up on record credit card so I don't have to reenter info.

Version 2.13.0 2013-04-18 4
I amazes me that in this day and age of tablets that they still make an app that only works in portrait.  Doesn't work in landscape.  Very short sighted on their part. Other than that little picky complaint, it's a great app.

Version 2.13.0 2013-04-13 5
I love this app I can see what the hotel has/doesn't and make quick changes all with out the need to call anyone got to love that!
Version 2.09 2012-10-25 4
Good app for booking when on the road. Wish it had a better option for booking in another city instead of having to type in the city. Needs a 'redo search in this area' feature like yelp has.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-21 5
Love my ihg app. Use it everywhere! Best hotel app out there and I use them all. Travel a lot for business and this is most user friendly for sure!!
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-27 5
Excellent app. The only thing missing is an easy ability to find Point Breaks Reward Night hotels on it as you can online.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-27 5
I travel about 100 days a year and use Priority Club App and I love it!
It has really made it so convenient to book my hotels using my phone App.
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-16 4
Very handy app to have on my phone. Haven't had any problems using if, but it would be nice if there was an option to book a room using points and cash like in the website.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-30 5
With the app you do not have to worry about getting someone who doesn't speak very good English! It is super easy to use and book your hotel!
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-07 5
Lots of different functions; works well; easy to make reservations and changes; nice job
Version 3.0.2 2013-08-27 5
I use this app all the time when on the road. Easy to book, cancel, and change reservations
Version 2.08 2012-10-06 2
I modified a reservation on the website, and the app is still showing the trip with my original (now incorrect) check-in date. Makes the app useless at best and confusing at worst for the ~40% of my reservations that change at some point between booking and arrival.

Passbook integration would be nice too.
Version 1.0 2010-04-27 5
I love this app!!  I can check my account balance/status, review my reservations, and book new reservations.  This will surely be one of my most used apps.
Version 2.11.0 2013-01-28 5
This app is easy to use. I love being able to see my points here and search for hotels instead of having to use an Internet browser.
Version 3.2.4 2013-12-29 5
Great apps, very convenient, I booked the hotel in the morning and when I get there, the room is ready for me and it was a high season, love this app..
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-12 5
Love the map view, would love if I could zoom to an area and hit a search button to find all avail hotels on that map screen!
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-19 4
Good tool for quick views of locations but lacks details of each property.  If this was added I would make all reservations via the app.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-12 5
Services are consistent wherever I go. Whether its in Manhattan or Knoxville, staff is always courteous.  Rooms are clean and presentable upon arrival.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-06 5
I've used this numerous times on the road, and found it to be quick and easy. So far it has worked every time.

What else is there to say! This app is awesome, I can always see my point balance, where the closest hotel is and all my confirmations.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-12 4
App is easy to use! you can find hotel that you want and make a reservation in only a few minutes time. Plus it always shows you your current rewards balance.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-13 5
Love this app!  Would be cool if there was a "Chat With Live Representative" feature.. But all is good for now. There's always room for improvement. :)
Version 1.1 2010-05-13 3
Love the app. But there is no way to book reward nights. Only cash nights. 

The web makes it easy to book reward nights. However it is impossible here.   The app knows how many points you have. It should let you book with them.
Version 1.5.1 2010-11-16 2
I like this app to help locate hotels and to look at my upcoming reservations, but keep experiencing problems with it updating new reservations and taking off past reservations. Also would like to see the map of where the hotels are in a city or area. That would be helpful to figure out which hotel to stay in, when I  am traveling.
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-17 3
This app *should* make it easy to find and sign up for IHG reward deals. It also has the annoying feature of showing push notifications when it really has none. No way to clear them. User interface is non intuitive.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-10 5
I use several different apps for hotel reservations when I travel.  This is by far one of the easiest to use.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-06 5
This is an excellent app for pleasure and business travelers and I would highly recommend it. It's ease of use is second to none.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-07 5
I have used this app in the past but the recent improvements make the app easier to use than the website.
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-28 5
I have been riding in a car through a strange town and booked a room as I turned into the parking lot. Fast. Easy. No glitches. I love this app.

Version 2.12.1 2013-04-02 4
This app is awesome for keeping up with my reservations and my points. This way I know exactly when & where I'm staying and what is available to me through this company.
Version 3.2.2 2013-11-16 4
It would be nice if the app would automatically find the nearest hotel, when there aren't any in the hotels in the set search radius.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-25 5
This app is simple and to the point. Allows you to book just as of using a full blown browser. Piece of cake to use.
Version 3.2.3 2013-12-12 5
Help! Love this app use it all the time but it is crashing on my iPad. Platinum member and need to make reservations.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-12 4
I've used the app constantly and it has been very helpful. Using a cell phone and going though the full HTML page was painful, and as someone who is on the road 80% of the year, it's a big help.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-08 5
IHG knows how to make a process easy! Takes me three clicks with this app and they have a very good points system.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-14 5
Convenient - easy to use and usually has all the available rates at the low end and including add ons and upgrades. I love it!
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-12 5
Of the major US chain hotels, I find this app to be the best. No log in out, remembers cc'd info, shows hotels on map, even has current promotions.

A clean and simple app. Easy to make reservations. I wish the points section had more details about my prior stays.

When traveling it is so nice to know when staying at an IHG hotel the customer service and facilities will be top notch. Thanks IHG.

Use the site when on business and it has been helpful. Highly recommend for the road warriors.
Version 1.1 2010-07-12 1
I tried to use it today for the first time, it cannot be more bad!!! Being only half block from a Holiday Inn and a Crown Plaza, and 8 blocks from another HI, trying to book myself in either of those ones, it showed me only the closest options at 1,161 miles away!!!  No matter how many times I tried, it only gave options of that kind.... I am uninstalling it as soon as I finish to write this....
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-15 4
This app is convenient, but would like to be able to view other amenities and modify things without having to go to the website part.  Otherwise, great app
Version 3.3.0 2014-01-10 5
I use this app regularly and it works well for me. I find where IHG hotels are and get my reservations made.

Been using the app for the last 3 years when making reservations and I've enjoyed it!!

No need to call or go to the website. This app gives you everything on your finger tip.

Easy to use. Good for business travel (doesn't show pet-friendly for leisure.) Quick booking though I wish you could view discounts (point breaks, first weekends, etc...)
Version 3.2.1 2013-11-23 5
Love earning points to buy the various gift cards that are available.
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-25 4

Elegance in simplicity. I use it for work traveling the country and I love it. No matter where I am I know I can locate the comfort of an IHG location in the area.

Very good app. Works well and is easier than going to their website to book rooms.
Version 2.10.0 2013-01-05 3
The biggest issue with the app is that you can not update your calendar with reservation.  This is a big problem. Instead you have to login to the site with a computer then download to your calendar. The whole idea of an app is to simplify.
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-22 5
Never have a hard time finding what I need quickly with this app while traveling.

Great all the way around. Customer service, planning, everything.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-07 5
I travel 3-4 days a week and constantly use this and the iPad app. They both work flawlessly and with ease.
Version 2.11.0 2013-01-24 1
Second update without iPhone 5 display support. Time to find a new Product Manager. 

Previous version... So, you update your app to use iOS 6 Apple Maps, but don't include iPhone 5 display support? Shame on you developers... shame. 

App does have good UX for booking reservations, they just shouldn't have released a lackadaisical update. Poor form.
Version 2.13.0 2013-05-01 4
I like this app.  Wish it allowed me to put in what city i wanted to search near and to adjust # of miles from a city.  Otherwise, i don't have any problems on my iPhone 4.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-26 5
Contains all the information and functionality one needs
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-28 5

Version 2.11.1 2013-03-09 5

Version 3.3.0 2014-01-08 2
I use this app all the time but with the new update they have forgotten to put any button to allow you to return to search further if the room or hotel is not what you want. Ugh! You have to exit the app then totally shut down the app in order to search further. Please fix this guys. Thanks.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-22 5
I travel a lot for work and this app reflects reservations I make in Concur. It's nice to have everything in one place!

Have been a member for some time now, and I find priority club versatile and useful

Quickly finds our favorite hotel brand (Holiday Inn Express) and convenient to reserve a room...who wouldn't love it?!
Version 2.11.1 2013-01-31 5

Version 2.11.1 2013-02-22 5
Track points easily.  Find a local hotel.  Review reservations.  It is easier than calling a front desk.

Excellent app. Booked multiple times with no issues and the app keeps me up to date on rewards info.
Version 1.1 2010-05-17 4
This is a nice app, but I agree that it is a pain to have to enter your credit card# and email address (twice!) every time you book a room. Please add this functionality and it will be a great, convenient app.
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-18 4
Gives you the basics... Wish they still had the offers on the app though... Like that while on the go you have all the info you need

I stay out 2 nights a week for business and this is the only way I will book my stays.  App is easy and fast.  Love it!!
Version 3.2.2 2013-11-15 3
IHG you have to make some fixes!!!!  I need to be able to copy the hotel address and also the phone number. Also, if there is not a IHG in the exact city it says no results found (i. e. Caldwell, ID). It needs to expand out to find hotels in the vicinity.
Version 3.2 2014-03-16 5
I use it all the time. It is very easy to set up local reservations and keep track of your reward points.
Version 2.12.1 2013-04-01 5

Helps me a lot on booking a room without dealing with customer rep. Just search and book, all I need to do...
Version 3.3.1 2014-04-25 3
This app is a great starting point for a better app. I think you should have a map In the app with all Ihg brand hotels. This would be helpful and easier to find a hotel closest to where I am, while I'm traveling at that point in time.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-16 5
Makes it easy to find and contact the hotels when I am traveling for work.

Great chain of hotels but the app could use some work (ie. faster browsing, less freezing, option to update points balance)
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-17 4
The Priority Club program is terrific, offering a wide range of price options for rooms that are all well cared for, and this app couldn't be any easier to use.

Stable, simple and efficient app. Gives access to all the needed information and makes reserving a room fast and efficient.
Version 2.12.0 2013-03-14 4
When you scroll the map you should have the option to search on that part of the map. Like the Starbucks app does in map view.

Makes finding a great hotel at a reasonable price easy, every time, no matter what city you are traveling to.

Version 3.2.3 2013-12-25 2

It also took quite some time to load locations and I had no indication that it was actually doing anything.

Version 3.0.0 2013-08-06 5
Great way to book, update or cancel all my reservations! Also a great tool to help me keep track or my IHG points.

I have used the app numerous times and it has worked flawless.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-04 5
Fast and easy once it is setup. I can find and reserve a room in about 30sec. Once my profile is setup.
Version 3.2.3 2013-12-15 4
App works well. The Tap Map update is great. The only downfall of booking with the app is the inability to use Platinum Elite status to get a room if the hotel is sold out.
Version 2.10.0 2013-01-11 5
Like having the phone numbers handy and also the map of the hotels.
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-01 4
Great app, just pull it out anywhere in the world and grab a booking based on location. If you are a PC Platinum this is a must have companion.

Version 3.0.0 2013-07-03 5
I am having trouble with the always on feature, however. Maybe needs an update?

Very convenient when traveling for last minute reservation.
Some special rate like mix of points and cash are not available on the app

Used it recently while traveling.  Easy to track, change, and make new reservations.

Version 2.12.0 2013-03-16 1
I'm a Platinum Ambassador and used this app constantly as I travel 3 weeks out of each month.  Since the most recent update I haven't been able to get this app to open at all, just crashed immediately each time.  I've been using the mobile site instead, but Id prefer to use the app.  Please get this fixed ASAP.  My Hilton Honors app NEVER crashes :(
Version 2.11.1 2013-03-05 5
Use it often, better than the website for reservations using priority points.
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-29 5
Always welcomed with a smile, a bottle of water and a war cookie!  Simple but good. What more needs to be said?
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-20 5
I can make a reservation in less than 2 minutes. It's amazing! It's easy! I love it!
Version 3.2.4 2013-12-30 5

Love it!!!
Version 3.2.4 2013-12-30 5
It has it all! You can track all your stays and see your points and rewards.

Love it!!!
Version 1.1 2010-05-15 2
I was very pleased to finally see an app since I use Priority Club all the time. But it is not an app you can use as a relable replacement for the website.  About 10 minutes of beta testing with real users or reading the reviews here and the weaknesses would be obvious to the developers.

Will only use in a pinch.
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-31 5
I use this app all the time to make business & pleasure reservations. It never let's me down.
Version 2.14.0 2013-05-30 4
Loving the app! Just wish I could make changes to my reservation from the app. Looks like I can only book or cancel an existing reservation.
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-25 5
Does everything I need from a hotel app, quickly & simply.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-24 5
Love the reward program and the point system is better than other hotel reward programs...
Version 3.3.1 2014-02-02 5
You need to make it so you can book with points and money. Other than that I love the app!
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-09 5
If you use these hotels, rewards member or not, this app is awesome!  Easy reservations, pics of the hotels, and find out what is nearby!

Easy to use. Quickly finds dining and attractions around the selected hotel.
Version 3.3.1 2014-04-17 4
Good app. I wish they will add receipt on app so you can view and email it and redeem points for gift card and merchandise. It wood be nice to have those option.
Version 3.0.0 2013-06-30 5
Staff are accommodating and professional.  They have a great attention to detail.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-01 5
This is a great rewards program. The best one amongst several that I have been a part of.
Version 2.14.0 2013-06-03 4
Great app. Only flaw is redeeming reward nights. Does not let you use points + cash,have to go to the website for that. Add that feature & it's a 5 star app easily.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-18 3
Simple app and an easy way to make reservations but limited beyond that function.  Would be nice to have point rewards enrollment and additional member benefit functions.
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-29 5
Certainly one of the best hotel apps, easy, quick, truly is easier than their regular web site.
Version 2.09 2012-11-09 3
I travel 4 nights per week and stay a mutable hotels. The app works well but I would like to see conformations sent to my calendar like the on line version. The app should update cancelations and changes
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-30 3
We love the priority club, but the app could use some work. It crashes occasionally when you are making reservation.  I've used to book while on the road and it comes in handy.
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-04 5
When in a hurry, don't worry.  This app will suffice, so you won't think twice!   Eh, me avente, me avente!!!
Version 2.12.1 2013-04-03 5
Earn free nights faster by finding a hotel just by starting the app.
Version 3.0.1 2013-08-10 5
Such an easy app to use. Keeps track of all of my activity, and a great way to find hotels on the go!
Version 3.3.0 2014-01-06 4
I know this will get better than the base average hotel app.  But, it's pretty good to get on the fly bookings and availability while traveling.  I expect better.
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-28 5
App is easy to use and helpful when considering lodging options while on the road.
Version 3.2 2013-10-27 5

Version 2.13.0 2013-05-03 5
Simple, fast tool. Great for quick reservations when coverage is bad.
Version 2.12.1 2013-03-28 4

Version 2.11.1 2013-01-31 5
I really enjoy the priority app because it keepsake updated on my points and hotels in the area! Hotel points are the best at Holiday Inn!

App should better handling booking and smart to be used offline especially for frequent traveler with data roaming.

When am on the road and need a place to stay this is the app I turn to. Interface is just perfect and when I find a room the price is perfect too. Thanks
Version 1.1 2010-05-16 1
Since there is no AAA pricing (which usually is the best) I have no use for this App. As far as I can tell no favorite hotels list either. No iPad version. The best way for making reservations remains the full browser site. Even the mobile site is missing number of features. It is a shame that my favorite hotel chain is not able to put together a useful app in such a long time.
Version 3.0.0 2013-06-28 5
This a really good app that manages seamlessly all you reward points. This is good stuff.
Version 2.13.0 2013-04-16 5

Version 2.13.0 2013-05-16 5
This app is by far the easiest way to find a hotel and see what is actually available.
Version 3.0.2 2013-09-18 5
This is a great app to book and cancel reservations while on the road.
Version 2.13.0 2013-05-01 4
But it should have a data pack to transfer into the passbook on iPhones. It's a pain logging in when I need to pull the points rewards number.
Version 3.3.1 2014-03-13 5
Love it, the ease of scheduling and ability to tracking my reservations is great
Version 2.11.1 2013-04-02 1
This app is terrible! Not only can I not sign in with either email name or membership number,if by chance I do get on, it bumps me write off!
It is very limited in functionality, can't even transfer to full website access like before.
I haven taken it off my phone & IPad because it is so inefficient.
Give me back the old one- at least it worked!!!
Version 2.12.1 2013-04-03 5
The app is very useful and the reward program is amazing. They treat you really good in most of the hotels.
Version 2.11.1 2013-02-23 5

Version 2.11.1 2013-02-23 5
So much better than calling the number and talking to someone you can't understand!
Version 3.3.0 2014-01-18 4
This is a great app!  The only downfall is you can't store preferences in your room and I get special rates for work so if I'm going to use that rate i need to call.
Version 3.0.0 2013-07-27 5
I travel a lot for work and this app makes my travel just a little easier. Thank you IHG
Version 3.2.3 2013-12-04 5

Stop harassing users to leave reviews of the app. It's especially disingenuous when you frame the request as 'Do you love IHG?'

Clicking no launches the mail app so that you can waste time telling IHG why you don't love them. 

Clicking yes launches another dialog box begging for an app review.

You begged...so here you go.

I am a loyal Priority Club member but this app needs lots of work. It doesn't let you choose rate options like Senior, AAA and points. I also could not figure out how to search for a hotel near the airport. Also can't see all the hotel services like airport shuttle.

This App is pretty useful but for the last couple of updates it has a bug that keeps the App using Location and drains out the battery, if this isn't a bug then it's really stupid! Having to turn Location On and Off is really annoying!
Version 3.1.4 2013-10-02 4

Version 2.03 2012-01-19 3
Really needs more hotel detail. Also need stay reviews for feedback. App is pretty good, so content is issue not app.

Version 1.1 2010-05-17 2
The app does not keep you credit card information.When you have to put in the billing information everytime it is a problem. Please get that fixed
Version 1.1 2010-07-14 1
I agree with other reviews. Did nobody actually test this thing
Screens that won't go away
Continuously said state code for Oklahoma was invalid 
Needs to store personal data to prevent reentering 

Poor overall design would have been great on a 20" desktop
Version 1.2.4 2010-09-14 5
A++++
Version 1.5.1 2010-12-13 5
Makes checking and making reservations very easy.
Version 1.5.2 2011-02-12 1
After receiving error message after error message, app managed to book me 11 times.  Customer service is currently working on problem so my credit card isn't charged.
Version 1.5.2 2011-03-10 5
I don't know what everyone is whining about. This app is awesome!! It does exactly what you want it to do. I don't have to guess the nearest township when trying to find a hotel anymore. I just hit the locate button and it finds it for me. I can see nearest hotels on google maps, get price information, my account info at a glance, and more! A great app that will cut your time it takes to reserve a room in half. Great job priorityclub!!!!!
Version 1.5.2 2011-03-13 5
Love it! It is very user-friendly and very simple to use. Best hotel app on the market!!!!
Version 1.5.2 2011-03-14 5
Very user friendly! Love this app!!!
Version 1.5.2 2011-03-17 1
Great app, but it's not really "free".   The regular web site or even calling the hotel is typically $10 less for the same room.
Version 2.01 2011-07-30 4
I agree with Apfeli. I use ich hotels quite often and am quite fearful of losing my phone since all of this information would be available.
Perhaps keeping the username saved is ok, but I'd much prefer to be prompted to type in my password just as I am with any of my bank apps, etc.
Nonetheless, great app. I love how I can see my membership level, membership number and points balance.
Being able to see future reservations, and previous stays are also great features.
JOB WELL DONE.
I honestly think other hotel groups should learn from this app.
Version 2.01 2011-09-18 1
Doesn't work
Version 2.06.01 2012-08-21 4
I have been using this app all summer while on a 3 month road trip. It's very easy to book both reward and paid stays, to see your balance and sign up for promotions.  

The only complaints I have are that thy say they are giving you the "best available rate" but Priceline.com is cheaper.  
On the promotions, it doesn't explain fully what "qualifying " stays are, leading to a bit of confusion.
Neither of those have anything to do with the app design which is great.
Version 2.10.1 2013-01-23 5
Love it, love it, love it!
Version 2.11.1 2013-01-31 5

Works great. I book my hotel with it weekly. I wish it would let you input a corporate rate code and I wouldn't have to change the rate when checking in.   I'm sure most hard core users of this app have a better rate than the app shows. It would make check in easier.

When making reservations through the app, there is NO notification if the room you are booking is a pre-paid non-refundable reservation. When using a web browser, it is still not obvious, however you can still find that crucial piece of information. Most of my travel is for business and is subject to last minute changes. As such, I never use the IHG app to make my reservations because I can not afford to make a pre-paid non-refundable reservation for business travel because I require the option to cancel reservation with no charges. What is even more frustrating is that when you speak to an IHG representative, they arrogantly state that I was notified at time of booking reservation that it was non-refundable. I have to physically show them the app and how there is NO notification that it is non-refundable. To make matters worse, the representative states, "that is interesting".  And is obviously not informed of the behavior of the IHG app and even when shown that there is notification, they still will not refund the reservation. This scenario is NOT acceptable. The only way to mitigate this problem is to use a browser. The browser page on the iPhone is not optimized for the iPhone screen and it is terribly difficult to use the web page from the iPhone. In conclusion, the behavior of the IHG iPhone app is only useful to find a hotel and view reservations. For any other type of request in the iPhone app, the web browser must be used to ensure you get all the details of the room/rate information.
