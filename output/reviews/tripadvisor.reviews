As a regular guest at Fairmont hotels, I was particularly looking forward to my stay in London at The Savoy.  As only one of two hotels in the chain that don't use the Fairmont name brand, I eagerly anticipated my visit to this special, historic property.  I was not disappointed.  After its recent renovation it is a gem and worthy once again of its 'best hotel in London' reputation.   Prior to arrival we were in touch with the concierge staff several times to arrange everything from theater tickets to rental cars.  They were first class in every detail... From best seats to best cars!  Our room, in the river wing, was an Edwardian style room overlooking the courtyard.  Spacious and beautifully decorated with many closets and fine appointments, it was perfect for our three-night stay.  It came with a universal power outlet adapter in case you forgot to bring one.  High speed Internet was truly speedy, and free as always with your Presidents Club membership. Upon returning to the room after a day of museums and shopping, we were pleasantly surprised to find house made strawberry rhubarb chutney with shortbread and drinks awaiting us in our room. A lovely afternoon tea is just what we needed!  In all a fantastic hotel with fantastic British staff that truly understand the meaning of service.  Highly recommended and sure to be our hotel of choice when in London.

Excellent Anniversary Get-A-Away!!
My husband surprised me with a trip to this resort for our Wedding Anniversary and we have been going back every since then. We truly love all the updates to the  resort over the last couple years, the new Blush Plush Bed is excellent.
 Morris Obie's Spooner's Cafe's chicken cheese steak sub is really good too.
 Because we usually stay in Champagne Tower's I can not comment on what the other rooms are all about. Our suite  is always excellent. Staff is excellent especially Dennis during dinner he is definitely a great addition. 
The Parrot Lounge and Night Club are great for getting your "happy on". We liked the fact all gratuities are already include in your bill. All Inclusive really means everything has been paid and thought of for their guest.
Concert performances with various celebrity's, bands and comics is great too.
 Their various fun activities arranged for the guest and given to you on daily basis during your stay...  If you ever leave your room-LOL
Dinner: We did ask to eat by ourselves for our Anniversary Dinner but, all other meals we ate " cruise style" which was a lot of fun. The calamari at dinner and cheese blitz on the buffet was excellent .. 

Our Anniversary Dinner, In room and onsite photos  were wonderful too.
We already have our next stay booked and we can't wait.

One of the benefits of TA membership and the full website is the wealth of information that can be clicked through that can truly give you a sense of understanding something as complex and unknown as a resort on an island in a country you have never visited, or as simple as a coffee shop in your neighborhood you might have overlooked. Such a resource is not trivial to replicate or access in a mobile app. This is not as simple as replicating bank transactional functionality. TA has done a good job of providing access to the resources of its website, but the interactivity and interrelatedness of those resources is not fully implemented. Not sure how you can do that, but if TA figures it out, this will go from quite good to killer. For now, it is more a "gateway research" tool, and at that, it's quite good. None of that is to detract from the fact that this is a good app that makes the full TA resource even more effective (and with less advertising than the full website). And of course, it is a potentially excellent resource while traveling. On a recent trip on the U.S. east coast that included two cities I had not visited in a while, TA helped me locate good espresso shops that my specialized coffee apps failed to reveal. Heck, that's worth 5 stars right there.

We stayed at Majestic at the end of july for 7 nights and traveled with a group of 12. The hotel was absolutely beautiful! The beach was amazing and thr hotel grounds were immaculate. The food was the best that I have had at an all inclusive. The buffet had such a wide selection that there was something for everyone. We also enjoyed the steakhouse which had excellent food and a beautiful view of the beach.  The best part of our trip were the Dominican people! Everyone was so friendly. We loved our coffee boy Erbin who served our coffee every morning with a smile. My three year old son loved him. Our housekeeper was so sweet and she did a wonderful job cleaning the room. She started coming into our room early when she saw that we had a little one who needed afternoon naps, which I thought was nice. The best part of the trip was the funjestic team, especially wilkins, tutti frutti, dalilah, lookey lookey, Nemo, Edwin, and Luis! They made our trip so much fun for everyone in our group! There were plenty for both kids and adults to do. My favorite was zumba by the pool every day with tutti frutti. The whole funjestic team works so hard and they certainly made our vacation a blast. We will most definitely return to this place;)

The overall layout is well organized, in some ways better than the website.
Unfortunately, I found the hotel locations on the map can be VERY, VERY WRONG.
Example:   I searched hotels in Sitges, Spain.  The hotels listed in the left column are shown on the map as A, B, etc.  However, at least three of the hotels were shown pointing to the wrong dots, including the two highest rated hotels, the Galeon and the Platjador.  The latter is shown at a location probably 150m or more from the beach promenade, whereas it actually is right on the promenade.  Also the location of the Parrotts Hotel was off by over 1/4th mile.   
This completely misleads the reader, especially if location is a prime criterion.   The website maps appear to be correct.

I could not find a way to report this flaw to TripAdvisor.  The app needs a feedback function so they can correct errors such as this. 

If the map locations were correct, I'd probably rate 5 stars.  As it is, it only deserves 2 stars.  

BEWARE of this potential bug for any search on this version.

Update:   The map problem is even worse than it thought. 
Searching hotels in Madrid, the location of Atlantico on Gran Via ended up on C. de Alcala about 1/2 mille away.  And the locations of the Atlantico on Gran Via was labeled as the Hotel Regina. 

It is possible that the incorrect locations arise when you zoom or move the map  --- but in any event it is a major bug!

TRUE STORY: I once dated a higH fashion model who excused herself to use the 'Cat box'.  Five minutes later, a waiter slipped me a note from two giggly girls. They wanted to go out with me. What utterly crushed my ego was the Reason they wanted to go out with me. I was told my date was so cultured and beautiful that I had to be rich else connected to have a woman like that to be seen in public with the likes of me!!!

Substitute coffee for the model I dated and that is the coffee at Temple (2 DT Sacto locations).  When was the last time you quaffed coffee made by a top rated US coffee bar? As a coffee Gourmonde, I have impossibly high standards---but not like a single varietal Ethopean Yrgecheff espresso !!! 

For a lousy $3.50, I can call Donald Trump and sniff Jamacian Blue Mountain coffee---kinda slumming this morning, aren't we Donny? For a lousy $3.50 I can quaff an expertly crafted expresso I could never make at home from the finest coffee chain (2 stores) in America.  How many opportunities do you have to think you are better than everyone else for a lousy $3.50?!!! 
Enjoy your coffee with the terminally hip dozens of Sacramento and make snide remarks about Starbucks patrons!!!

I love that the Oct 2013 update lets me filter for pet-friendly hotels. BUT (and this applies to every app that lets users compare hotel prices):

1) to make a useful comparison, the user needs not just the base room rate, but parking fees and pet fees. These never seem to be available except at the hotel's own website, and the difference can be HUGE. 

2) booking online is not a practical option if you're traveling with a pet, because none of the apps (including the hotels' own) let you select a pet-friendly room. Unless you've made your reservation by phone with the hotel, you might learn at check-in that the room grade you reserved is off limits for pets... I know TripAdvisor doesn't do direct booking, but it would be great to know whether pets are limited to certain rooms, so we can factor that in when deciding whether to book online. 

3) One easy fix I'd like to see in a future update: display uploaded photos beginning with most recent.

It's a letdown to share a photo and not be able to see it without scrolling through a hundred or so older ones. 

4). I know I said three. Minor glitch: I can no longer select Helpful when reading reviews by other users. 

I haven't found a single booking app that

I like the chance to read reviews by people who recently traveled to all sorts of places, including less popular destinations like Anguilla and Bonaire.  There is room for improvement, though.  It is hard to keep your searches confined to your location.  For example, I'm in Anguilla, and search for Bonjour Cafe and get someplace in New Zealand.  Also, when I look at the reviews, not all restaurants have information about the hours or price range, yet when I write a review, I don't have the option of providing that information.  Finally, places are not well marked on the map and there seems to be no way to correct that.  It would be nice to interface better with google maps to get more accurate pins.

I just downgraded my stars from 3 to 2 as I see I started this review a year ago, and the same problems exist still.  In addition to the above, when you look at a list of restaurants in a city, they will be listed in order of popularity but the second one will say something like #16 of 43.  There is no way to get #1 at the top, nor  see all of the 43. The list will scroll and show you 26 of the 43 restaurants with no way to search by name or keyword.

I had to resort to going to Fodors website to find something to explore, then return to TripAdvisor app to see if I could find it in the list.  Sometimes I could NDI sometimes I couldn't.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 2
Ok, I love Trip Advisor. I love how they motivate people to write reviews with 'badges.'

But... hate to say it, they make searching for the name of the place you want to write about really frustrating.

Case in point:

I was looking for the new Starbucks located in the new Barclay Center in Brooklyn. 
1) it yields search results of Starbucks from other cities, sometimes even countries 
2) once you isolate the city, it will show you several Starbucks but WITHOUT the address. Ugh!!! So I will end up clicking on the result, just to see if the address matches, and then hit the Back button to click another Starbucks hoping to hit the jackpot and see if that has the address I want. Sorry, but Yelp makes looking for the listing easier, showing the address upfront to help you choose if it's the right one.
3) And so, if I can't still find it, I will end up using Google and typing the name, address and the word, trip advisor. Ugh!!! I mean, what's the point of the search field within the site or app if I'll end up using Google. 

For other more distinct listings, search finds it fast. But when you review chain locations like looking for a particular Starbucks, Trip Advisor's search engine fails.

I hate to say it but Trip Advisor should study how Yelp does it. 

Don't worry Trip Advisor. I still like you.

Scrub jdjdand Fire          || TOP ||
In the pre-settlement landscape, scrub systems were maintained by periodic fires. Scrub fires were often intense. Oaks, saw palmetto, and shrubs in the heath family sprout after burning. Scrub dominated by these sprouting species recovers rapidly after fire with little change in species composition. Sand pine is killed by fire, but sand pine has serotinous (closed) cones that open and drop seeds after being heated by fire. Florida rosemary and some other species regenerate from seed stored in the soil. Longleaf pine is well adapted to fire; mature trees survive most fires, and grass-stage juveniles are fire resistant. Mature slash pine (South Florida variety) survive many fires; juvenile slash pine are more vulnerable to fire mortality

Scrub animals avoid fire in burrows (e.g., gopher tortoise) or move out of the way (e.g., scrub jay)

Without fire:

Habitat structure becomes unsuitable for scrub jays
Herbs used for food by gopher tortoises decline
Bare ground needed for pine reproduction is absent
Openings required by rare plants decline
Sand Pine Burning

I love TripAdvisor and use it constantly for researching hotels and things to do in destinations worldwide so I thought I'd give Local Picks a go too. However, this app does not match up to the quality of the website at all. The ratings for the restaurants seem to constantly appear as either 0 or 4 stars, usually not matching the rating on the website itself. There are a number of restaurants that have closed down a long time ago, but that is forgivable as TripAdvisor would need to be told that. It appears that to be able to read any information apart from the price range and contact information you have to let the app close and open Safari to the TripAdvisor website (why?), which makes checking multiple listings quickly rather frustrating.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-31 3
Before I complain I'd like to state that my wife and I are big fans of the website. We have planned many great trips using the website. Everything from our honeymoon in Canada to a European vacation. The greatest and most versatile tool we utilize on the website search engine is the hotels versus bed and breakfasts. I understand it's hard to include all features from a comprehensive website, but when you can't even choose to find bed and breakfast places in the app I think you have greatly weakened the quality of your product. The app then is not really giving a true search of the possibilities of places to stay, which then calls into question the quality of the the other information given.

My test of this deficiency was quite simple. I did a search for hotels in the Santa Ynez Valley area in California, which we know very well, but were looking to see if any new ones had popped up. A bed and breakfast that we have stayed at and is highly rated on the website search engine didn't even come up. It may seem like a minor thing, but when I can access the full website and get more and better info, why would I choose to use a limited info app?

I'll be going back to the site engine.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-23 5
Great, wonderful app, and so much easier to use than the online version. If you are planning a trip, you need this app - half the work is already done for you. 
Here are suggestions for improvements:
- The maps show invaluable information at the touch of a finger, and I saved many of my destinations and accommodations to "My Saves." I was repeatedly and highly frustrated, though, that these "Saves" do not appear with, or overlaid on, the regular maps. So If I saved my hotel in London, for example, and went to view it, none of the other Trip Advisor-marked locations show up, and my hotel is a dot on a street, devoid of any context.  I think this could be addressed several ways including this one:
-I would like to have the ability to "pin" my own locations directly to the Trip Advisor map.
-Mileage or distance between two tapped locations would be immensely helpful in planning.
-I agree with other reviewers about the need for site links and the vertical orientation. 
Thank you for a well-designed and thoughtfully executed travel app!

I really liked the previous version, but the current version seems to have some quirks and bugs. Example: looking for 'Bonaire' I get suggested results 'Bonaire, Caribbean', 4000mile east, and 'kralendijk, Bonaire', 1400 mile SE.  Both are the same place, so something is wrong about the coordinates. Second example, I look at the entire Bonaire map, and it only shows 4 hotels. But: it states 'number 7 out of 23 hotels'.  OK, great, so why can't I see the other 19? At which point you notice that the 'settings' icons does not have an option to provide feedback. 

And finally, about the clunkiness, they should separate 'back to previous section' from 'back to previous view'. I had panned around the map for a while, and tried to go back to the main menu using the 'back' button. Turns out, you new to rewind through your entire map history to get back to the menu. Odd. Also, the 'back' button not iOS standard. Why not follow UI guidelines.

Update, from what I read the current state of affairs is due to the switch to Bing. So maybe it's this: if bing can't map the address of the hotel, it won't show in the app. Makes sense, except that it makes the app useless in certain places..

Make sure to take a camera & a journal to sketch & write in. If you don't draw or paint or write, use it to paste in ticket stubs, stamps of places you've been (all national parks either have a stamp or stamps you can buy to stick in your journal or in their passport books you can buy from , which I also do). Why all this you may ask? Because at the end of the trip what you will have is memories. Photos, documents, stamps, artwork you did & other items help to bring back the thoughts of the events from the trip. It's fun & anyone can do it. You don't have to spend a lot if money on a book to do this in. If writing & pasting in images then one w/ lines to write on may be helpful. I use a sketch pad journal with either drawing paper or watercolor paper in it to create my image of what's in front of me or if not time to finish I take photos as reference to finish art from later. This is your personal book & you may share it w/ others or keep to yourself . It's up to you. Just have fun & enjoy doing a journal (which ever kind you do).

I travel, I go out a lot, I write (primarily for Tripadvisor) and I use it extensively, including to cross check other rating service, which are not nearly written with such detail and commitment as the ones to be found here.  To benefit the most, first look at the total number of reviews and how they are distributed from terrible to excellent.  There should be few terrible and poor ratings, and any should be related to specific bad experiences or bad behavior by some staff member.  If there is a common pattern, think twice.  If the problem happened many months ago, perhaps it has been corrected.  Do not hesitate to ask before you commit.  Then read the rating upward and note the "level" of the reviewer and the depth of the review.  Ignore "the best food on earth" type of reviews, particularly by new reviewers.  Few places on earth are really "excellent" overall, just as few are "terrible" unless you have been attacked by a hoard of cockroaches.

My dad actually uses the regular website for his business trips. Sometimes we look for perfect hotels for our vacations. My family is going to Branson, MO sometime this spring or summer, and I went on the app store to find a travel app. I came across this app, and I decided to try it out. When it loaded up, I selected the app to see if it would work. It did! Since my family is going to Branson, dad asked me to look for a good hotel. Its not really that hard. All you have to do is:
1. Tap "Hotels" in the main menu.
2. Type in the city or airport your hotel is in or near.
3. Find the right hotel, and your on the page of the hotel or resort.
You can make reservations, look at the photo gallery, read the reviews, or even go to the hotels website. Here's an example.
I first tapped the "hotels" button in the mIn menu. Next I typed in "Branson, MO". Then I scrolled down and tapped "Marriott's Willow Ridge Lodge", which you will be familiar with if you've seen Disney's Wilderness Lodge.
Version 5.9 2011-11-09 3
I thought this app would be all that I would need to use to plan a trip, but it is lacking in many ways. I've listed what I found to be its strengths and weaknesses:

Strengths: 
- Plenty of detailed reviews for each item and summaries similar to iTunes. 
- Most items include ample photos. 
- Links to hotel websites for many items
- Zoomable map, although it keeps resetting itself at the slightest touch

Weaknesses:
- Only includes a small fraction of the lodging choices at the locations I have needed. 
- Lodging categorized (often incorrectly) as "hotel", "B&Bs/Inns", and "other" with no way to look at all choices at once or exclude some categories. 
- You can save (favorite) a hotel, but not a location or search. 
- FAR too many personal photos or photos of attactions in the area rather than the hotel itself.

Features which would be helpful: 
- Map to plot a route and record an itinerary
- Intuitive recommendation feature based on a combination of survey answers and choices at destinations along the route or previous trips

We just returned from a 7800 mile driving trip from Oregon to southern Florida and back. We had no preplanned route or any hotel/motel reservations for the whole trip. Using a combination of Trip Advisor, IExit, the Starbucks apps and our GPS we were able to find a good to great room every night along with meals,gas and coffee.  Trip advisor made it very easy to look at prospective motels through the photos section. Reviews of the subject properties are kept recent, including pricing ranges and were, on the whole, right on the mark. It's easy to add comments about individual properties too. We informed the desk clerks at each hotel that we had found them through Trip Advisor and in a couple of instances it led to a room upgrade or cheaper price.  Trip Advisor is a great app in our book!!  Couple it up with IExit and you have a perfect tool to get you where you want to go.
Version 8.3 2014-01-17 3
The depth of listings tends to be spot-on for wherever in the US I am visiting, BUT you can see where people have figured out the system and manipulated the ratings. For example, it will tell you virtually all your restaurant options well enough, but in a great dining town like Charleston or Savannah, foodies are greater with some very unappetizing odd ducks in the top rankings.   Not a matter of opinion there so much as quantifiably, your local Steak-n-Shake just doesn't belong that highly rated.  No offense to them - but you get my point as they serve a different market than "best food in town."   I also agree that some of the searches are limited:  a "brunch" or "breakfast" option seems oddly missing as those gems still seem to only be discovered by asking around, which is great too - but misses the point as to what this app is trying to accomplish.  Back the the positives, it does seem to be getting more content all the time to I'll stick with it as I know it will deliver completely...eventually!

Just got back from a cruise on Emerald Princess. what a wonderful cruise! This was the last cruise of the season and the weather pretty much held up. MY wife and I opted out of all the Princess excursions. We opted for the hop on hop off bus in several of the ports. However we did book a two day tour with Red October tours on the Internet about six months prior to the cruise. This was a private one on one tour of Saint Petersburg. This was by far the best money we spent on our vacation. Katherine our tour guide taught at the Unv. Of St. Petersburg with classes on Culture and History of Russia. We learned many entertaining things about Russia and it's Tsars. I would highly recommend this company.  We had two ten hour days that were all exclusive.

Tallinn, Estonian was a jewel of a city as was Arhaus Denmark. The entire cruise was wonderful. Only drawback was short days in the ports od Stockholm, Oslo and Arhaus.  Make sure you eat at Sabatinis on the Emerald. New menu go for the veal chop.

Trip advisor used to be fantastic. It was an unbiased guide to lands strange and familiar. 

This program has a major flaw in that it is not possible to see if the reviewer has been active - for how long and over how many reviews of different places. Hence one cannot discount obviously fake reviews which have found their way so cynically into TA that it has become practically useless. 

I just saw several gloating 5 star reviews of a diamond "museum" in Cape Town  which in reality is a diamond store - and the reviews that make the point that it is a store strongly felt trapped and conned - this one was obvious but not so with many other places. 

It is better to stick to the PC versions as it allows you to evaluate the evaluator by seeing the number of reviews, helpful votes and that this was not just a single review they were hired for. 

When this improvement is made and when TA adjusts for this factor in their ratings both this program and TA will become more reliable.

I started writing reviews as a result of bad experiences at hotels....unfortunately.  I recently went to the worst hotel in my life and it inspired me to update Trip Advisor in the hope that I could spare some poor soul from experiencing the hellish experience I had.  Anyhow, the iPad app is what i am using and it is very useful for quickly finding things near our hotel or even the hotel itself.  I appreciate the fact that the reviews seem balanced (not overwhelmingly positive or negative dominated) and actually helps you make some decisions.    My wife and I both have this app on our iPad and we use it for both business and leisure travel.   This can be very useful, especially when you are in a high traffic city and there are some hidden gems right nearby...ideally walking distance from your hotel.

We always book our hotels using Trip Advisor.  The advice has never led us astray.  We know that people have many different varieties of taste, but the experiences they tell are so helpful and insightful.  Recently we have also started leaving reviews because we feel that we need to also share and help others as we have been helped.  Finally it has been interesting to note hotel websites that now also quote trip advisor's patrons.  By the way, some hotel owners have responded to concerns raised by some patrons, perhaps they are becoming aware of how widespread the advice is traveling.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if Trip Advisor gives not only gave advice to it's traveling patrons, but also to the hotels and restaurants owners to make their establishment even better.  Truly, Trip Advisor is the best advice for all!

If you try to book a flight while internationally flying, YOU WILL NEED this app.  Getting bounced around different sites that don't translate we'll and are not good at taking address formats for credit card payments. Ext...  This app completely eliminates that hassle.   One of the BEST apps for HOTELS and FLIGHTS, and I always double check. 
I wish whomever is In charge of this app would put more activities up and allow for more flexible categories. Maybe like a geo-cashing type site, that integrates the user or advertiser to mark out special areas, like walks , areas of interest, guides not well know, activities that are hard to find or not popular, .  Things that rarely get ADVERTISED if ever, Example, put put golf, fishing guide or hole, swimming pool, waterfall, historic sites, locals favourite drive inn burger joint ext.......

Having travelled on over 35 countries on the last couple of years, you learn to appreciate fast paced metro areas as well as the "go slow" caribbean islands. The Trip Advisor app is very similar to the latter.
It is extremely slow, which performs terribly especially when you traveling and connect through less than perfect cellular networks on remote travel locations. It insists on loading a bloated banner image for each location before been able to click through. It doesn't remember your recently searched locations which is extremely frustrating when you looking for hard to pronounce and spell location on some remote country.
The search interface for the hotels doesn't allow you to see how the hotels are located on a map and when you drill down to hotel level it displays bing maps, which might be ok for traveling domestic , but once you cross the US border, it's maps are a joke.

To conclude, simply download the Expedia app, it is so much better. After you picked up your favorite , if you must, check it reviews in TripAdvisor

Invaluable for choosing hotels and restaurants while on the road. If you feel hungry for a particular food, Let's say, there you have it, a list, with up-to-dat, relatively accurate and unbiased reviews, complete with walking and/or driving directions to the place. I was not using Trip Advisor this way so much on my international trips (I will start on the next one), but for a domestic trip, say, up the coast of California, your i-Phone, in addition to all of the other things it does, becomes an interactive compass. No more walking/driving around aimlessly looking for a restaurant (or hotel), when you are hungry or tired!  Of course, exploring for hotels and restaurants is part of the fun of any trip, but, when you are hungry, thirty, tired, you just wanna get there. So, I am really loving my Trip Advisor now :)

I don't ever give a perfect score but this ap was a life saver! I was traveling solo across Europe and the only complaint is that I didnt find this sooner on my travels. I downloaded the Paris and London apps before I arrived to the cities. It afforded me the luxury of having a map and all the "best of" at my fingertips. Not only was that convenient, but a few times when I got lost within a few blocks from the location all I had to do was to click on the arrow that says get me there and the compass directs you. I also had the luxury of looking for restaurants around where I was with reviews without Internet. I found some fabulous small local restaurants with delicious cuisine because of this ap! I really feel like this ap is a must especially when traveling abroad, it helped enhance my experience immensely!

This is the most important app on my iPhone !
However I did not like the latest update: it lost the ability to list the town's ranked places by just clicking the rank of the given place in town (ie. there is no link over the text  #33 of 198 places in Bangkok) I always have to go back to the search page; also it does not save anymore my latest searches ( before it was just a matter of clicking the search box and it will show below my last searches).
Other very useful features I strongly recommend it to have are:
- ability to correct addresses ( in Southeast Asia so many are wrong ) , mainly when using the location pinpointed on the map
- ability to "like" other reviewers reviews  (this is only possible on desktops) 
- ability to review car rental agencies, it is currently the worst category of service in the tourism world.

I was fortunate enough to stay with my mother at this hotel for 8 days in May.
The hotel is located in the Marais-which is one of the most interesting shopping areas as well as walking distance to Notre Dame, Pompidou, the Louvre, and across the street from a great metro line.
     The staff could not be lovelier or more accommodating. They consistently went far above and beyond my wildest expectations. No request seemed too difficult.....
     The rooms are well appointed, tastefully decorated and ours had a magnificent balcony overlooking the lively Parisian streets. The room had many mirrors(good or bad-depending on your viewpoint), a fabulous "nespresso" Machine,mini fridge, and terrific mattress.
     We were truly overwhelmed with generosity of spirit of the staff. This hotel is the best deal around.

I must at least disclose up front that my experience using this app is somewhat limited, but that is because it provided limited results. I began my search for a beautiful location here in my home state of Arizona. I saw pictures and wanted to find out where it was and so googled it. I got the link to the trip advisor spot and so clicked to it. It asked if I'd like the app, and so I installed it. While the website had numerous reviews of the exact spot, I never could find it on the app. The best I could do is find the BLM wilderness area in which it sits. If I didn't already know about it, I'd never find it.

I'm guessing the app is just fine for finding the most popular big name. Attractions, as well as hotels and restaurants (though I am guessing here as I haven't tried anything wierd in those categories). But t won't help you find the off the beaten track places.

Dear Trip Advisor and all the folks who take the time to tell their stories. You are my eyes and my virtual experience. For new people, here's my strategy. Start with most recent reviews and read many of these. Look for similar comments, especially the bad ones. Then go straight to the worst ones and make sure you take note of the date!  Properties can change drastically when management changes even with chains. Keep your mind open to people with isolated personal faults. Look for similarities. Bugs, bad matresses, cleanliness, etc. Usually the odd ones are personal gripes with hotel staff or cranky family issues!  It's great when the hotel staff/manager responds. So, keep the communication open, my friends!  Happy and safe travel to all!

My wife and I are retired, in our early 60's, travel extensively and use the hell out of this app!  For users, please continue to actively and objectively submit reviews and also expand the type of categories reviewed.  The info makes travel SO much easier to decide upon booking AND makes worthwhile suppliers corrects deficiencies as well as reinforcing their good points.
The fact that these reviews are being penned by actual "users" makes the reviews so much more credible and valuable.
We generally throw out the top-rated reviews and ignore the low-bies as well.  (Some folks can't be pleased while others tend to oversell.  That's why it's nice to have a depth of reviews to work from.
Keep up the great work, Reviewers and thank you for continued input!

There r not enuf stars! Add more!  Greeted by courteous gentleman Jim at Yeager. Delivered cross the Kanawha to a booteeful redo at the HI in South Charleston (oddly named West Charleston but was actually north). I wasn't intoxicated!
Mia and Michael greeted with opened arms. Really!  made it to my room.  my planner tried to screw me, but Mia was an angel and moved me promptly to an exec room.
jim indulged us with a lift to the city center mall  Off Broadway was awesome  got 3 killer show for under 90.
We walked to Las Agaves,  Live music on a Monday, no less with perfect mags and food,  great time at the bar.  Falcons were robbed.  slept GREAT. Had an awesom hot breakfast. wish there were grits,
LORIA as the star of the show.,  We hosted group of almost 200 locals.  she did EVERYTHING to ensure our event was a success!  she even helped me with my brand new iPad!!

i told the GM we will do our level best to book all Palmetto GBA events at her hotel,  Service is better than what I got in France a few years back!

A great App. Unlike YELP, these guys don't "hide" good reviews and then contact businesses to advertise...  You can take these reviews for what they are.  My wife and I find restaurants when we travel or even near home.  Imagine being in another country and pulling up "restaurants near location" and sorting by type... Realizing you want to AVOID that Indian place in front of you, BUT the one just down the street (just around a blind corner) is one of the highest rated restaurants in London!  Not only that, but a 60 second read also tells you which dishes are not to be missed!  Not only that, but we find great new gems and local spots near our OEM even!  Get this App. Easy to use. Fresh. Trusted. Happy dining and sleeping!

I travel the world drilling oil wells & we frequently travel on numerous vacations. 
I rate my experience using Trip Advisor to be Excellent !!
Would not leave home without it & it is our most frequently used advisor on hotels & restaurants.
Because of Trip Advisor, no longer has it become a Hit or Miss in regards to our adventures.
We read the Reviews & our decisions are based entirely on the Reviews. 
Because of Trip Advisor, we are best able to use hotels which may be a little off the beaten path & not particularly a National Chain & as for restaurants - using Trip Advisor is Superb. Rarely do we receive a poor meal & we are able to coordinate addresses with our GPS to find even remote local only locations.
This is our best used App & we Rate it as Irreplaceable.

Update, much of my issues were user confusion with the new UI. The app is still my favorite travel app. Oh BTW I emailed TA with my issues and they reviewed them and responded. So I conclude they care about their app. 

This app has definitely taken a step backwards. It used to come up with your current location and you could just search for something based on your current location. Now you have to put in a location to get any information. The search results also appear more convoluted than they used to be. Fancy graphics and pretty pictures do not cut it.

It also does not allow you to put it in a folder. While I used to like the app and am a 'top contributor' to Trip advisor I will be using Yelp or Around Me until these issues are fixed.

Operation is also very quirky. This app has become a mess.
Version 5.8 2011-10-17 4
It is great site to get an opinion about your next destination. It works fine as to give you a general idea, but you need to read the reviews (the worst and the best) to understand the problems and whether it is of your concern or not. The site does not pre-qualify your concern (e.g. Noise, cleanness, etc...) to match the review automatically. Also the site did not order the hotels accordingly with the number of reviews, so you may get a Hotel that have an excellent review of few people and that none of them have the same concern as you have about noise for instance, so you may get a wrong impression and have a not so nice stay. We see many reviews where people refer for previous use of the site, and bad experience. Another limitation is it does not help you find accommodations for your family, like apart- hotels.

When traveling, the "near me now" feature is not as helpful as it sounds.  Four things would improve this and make it more like Yelp.
1.  Show results on a map, not just a list
2.  Allow for searching by map area, so you can scan what's in an area you are walking towards, not just where you are that second.
3.  When dropping a pin on a map to show where something is the app also  needs to also show the blue dot for where you are.  Navigation is a bit difficult in an unfamiliar city if I can't see where I am in relation to where I want to go.  
4.  Directions should be given via google maps rather than Apple maps.   The Apple directions are only for driving.  This is spectacularly unhelpful when standing in the middle of an ancient European city and needing to walk or take public transport.  Google maps can help with both.

Before the most recent update, I used Trip Advisor all the time.  Last year I planned a trip to Rome, which turned out to be a fantastic trip thanks to all of the pictures, reviews, and other information found on Trip Advisor.  One of the most helpful features was the map view.  I relied on that heavily.  Recently, I have been in the process of planning my honeymoon in South Africa and booked a couple of hotels and scoped out some good attractions with the information found in this app.  Then came the new version.  The map view that I loved on the new version is apparently gone. WHY?  There appears to be a different, much less user friendly version.  The pictures are also more difficult to view.  When I try to swipe to the next picture the app freezes up and I can't look at them.  Terrible.  In an apparent attempt to keep updating things, the makers of this app have taken a perfectly wonderful, user-friendly platform and ruined it.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 1
Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate. Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I am seeing much worse: locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area. Want to golf? Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesn't exist. The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house.

Next problem, related to this is the "Near Me" function. First, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town. When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse. The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house.

Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's a lot less functional than the website.

Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed. I am definitely unhappy with this version.

We use trip advisor regularly while traveling and have found amazing food, hotels, and things we love to do along the way and avoided some unpleasant mistakes. It's great to have a variety of information, someone usually has added the pieces that are important to us. Love that. BUT 1. When searching, every time It returns to the map it puts me somewhere in the Atlantic and I would rather be back on the map where I was. 2. I find incorrect or incomplete information and have no way of submitting corrections. 3. It puts me back on the home page for no apparent reason and I have to start all over. I really like being able to save locations, but it's too annoying having to go to the page to save something knowing I'm going to end up in the Atlantic and have to start all over. Thanks for a nearly excellent app.

We arrived at dollar with a 2 pm reservation plus the rapid service I signed up for last week. It's now been over an hour in line. The placed is mobed with hundreds of customers in line yet very very few counters open. It's about 40% running. There is no where to sit and crying babies and disappointed families in every corner. Food is on the floor and the place is complete disarray. I will never rent of the dump again. I would rather walk. Actually if I had walked to Pasadena I would be almost there. Plus the staff are rude and ignorant. No compassion for the customers standing in this never ending line rather than be with their families for Xmas. My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mom. She has a whole dinner planned tonight. Unfortunately we will be here at dollar waiting for our pre reserved rental car. Rush hour starts in 30 minutes, that will end any chance of seeing my family tonight. Shame on dollar for not properly staffing their rental car center during the important holiday season.

This app is great for looking up certain venues you are wanting to try out.  Reviews are typically spot-on, which gives this sight the validation it needs for its users to trust others reviews. 

I don't like that I can't access my user settings, at all! And sometimes the map function is more trouble than it's worth when you're trying to get directions from TA's "address" and the address you've plugged in as a from destination. For example, I was looking at the National Cathedral in DC and it uses it's intersection vs. it's actual street address, therefore, you have to go back and find its actual street address and plug it in. I call that a little cumbersome. 

Aside from a few glitches, I'd say it's a pretty good app! Thanks!

TripAdvisor has been indispensable in enabling me to dine at the best regional restaurants without wasting a dinning experience. Time & time again we have enjoyed our eating experience by first consulting TripAdvisor.

We find ourselves in trouble when a friend suggests a place to eat and we go without the benefit of a TripAdvisor review.  Recently we checked a review and found the place in Florida well rated.  Upon reading details we learned that recent reviews were down.  Apparently the establishment couldn't deal with in season volume of business.  We, as result didn't dine there.  I now look for a top rated place in each town we have dinner in.  Life is too short not to use TripAdvisor.  Bill B.

I have used TripAdvisor website for years to help plan getaways and vacations.  
Everything from hotel reviews to suggestions on what to see & do on vacations. 
For example, TripAdvisor was great to research my recent vacation to Hong Kong, Thailand, & China. 
The App seems to be right in line with the website. 
The only drawback I'm finding (with the App versus website)...   is in posting reviews - I can't seem to be able to post pics along with the review using the App. 
Maybe I simply haven't figured it out. 
But since all else is a breeze using TripAdvisor - I think while writing a review using the App, when finishing... It should prompt you as to whether you would like to post pics with the review or not.

I can't say enough good things about Trip Advisor! It has made our vacation so much easier in terms of knowing where to eat and finding lodging. There are just a few minor improvements that I would suggest... I sometimes can't access my Trip Advisor inbox from the iPhone app, which is inconvenient. I've tried it a few different ways & sometimes it works but other times it doesn't. Also I couldn't save private lodging rental listings under Saves. It seems like only commercial rentals like hotels or resorts and restaurants could be saved, which is a bummer. If you can rent it on TA it seems like you should be able to save it. Bottom line- great app! Will always use during future travels!!

I had to book through my employer's travel agency.  I was put in a smoking room due to this and it smelled like an ashtray.   I went to front desk to see if they could move me to a non smoking room.  They had nothing available in non smoking the first night so the guy working the front desk told me they could move me the next day.  The next day after my meeting  the front desk had a new key for me and I was given a suite for the same price.  This is how service should work!   

Also every night there was free food (lasagna, salad and breadsticks) the first night and free Pizza Hut the next night.  Not to mention a free happy hour. 
Hampton Inns are my favorite and this experience has kept me as a customer.  Hats off!!

Was tremendously useful during our family trip down to Yokohama Japan.  Shortly after downloading it, it was simple to navigate the program.  It let us know of all the great tourist spots, as well as giving helpful reviews of each locale.  As my wife and I only had a day and a half, we had to use our time judiciously and visit as many places as we could.  With its ability to save favorites and make them show up on a map, Trip advisor made this possible, and I look forward to using the app in the future.

  Also, while I'm not a big fan of Apple's Maps (sorry, Apple), Trip advisors integration with this helpful navigation program is most certainly welcome.  Way to go guys. Awesome AND useful.

If you are like us and love to travel but miss the comforts of home ...we have found the very best hotel.... The DC Ritz Carlton brings new meaning to the word HOSPITALITY!  We were pampered and cared for the entire stay!  The room was so special but always comfortable and immaculate. The staff was always attentive and so helpful!  The West End Bistro was amazing. Even if you are just in DC for the day treat yourself to this Piece of heaven!  They have an amazing menu and their appetizers and cocktails are the best we've had anywhere! This General Manager got it all right with an attention to detail and commitment to each guest to provide the best service and experience that will keep us coming back.  Can't wait to return!

More a 2.5 rating - I have higher expectations for tripadvisor

I'm sure it's optimized for saving and searching hotels and restaurants but I downloaded this specifically for rental searches and it's a super frustrating thing to:
1. Not be able to save those I am considering renting 
2. See those available on a nap all
At once 
3. What the heck is up with the last search not saving?! (Which brings ms to my next gripe)...
4. The "home" vs "back" button - just a BAD design. Make them different colors. Put them on opposite sides if the screen... Do something to make it more obvious so I don't wreck it all by mistaking my pressing home. If my prior list just came back w a forward button it would be fine!
5. Why, if you ask me about my dates that I am searching for, do you include rentals that do NOT have those dates available?! 

Fix all these things and u will be rewarded w 5 stars.

I've had the app on my iPhone for over a year now and use it quite frequently, definitely one of my favorites. I also love using the full site on my laptop. I just got an iPad and immediately tried out the app, and it's kind of a headache. It only allows landscape viewing. Small complaint, I know, but still annoying. When searching, it pulls in results by popularity, but not by ranking. The only sorting options available are popularity and price (low to high or high to low). Part of the reason I love TripAdvisor is the ranking aspect. When using the search feature it also tends to pull in some unrelated options. All fairly easy fixes, definitely 5-star with minor improvements, still my go-to app for anything travel related.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-24 3
Been using this app a lot to find good hotels while traveling. However, finding an available room at the last minute with accurate pricing (without clicking all the way through to a partner site) as well as the experience of writing a thorough review need to be improved! Lots of random errors during the review writing process, and lots of false positives while looking for available rooms in my desired price range. A few specific comments- I wish tripadvisor would add the fees charged by booking sites into the price you see in the search results. Second, I wish tripadvisor would fix the photo upload process such that the photo would not assume a horizontal orientation. My photos get stretched when I take them in the vertical orientation on my phone and then get rejected. Very frustrating.
Version 5.9 2011-11-11 3
Good access to TripAdvisor features and reviews, but it has some annoying behaviors. One annoyance is on the map view. If you just click the map button without selecting an item from the list, it assumes you want to see the #1 choice, and you can't turn it off if you scroll to see what's nearby, and pause to look at the map, it jumps back to being centered on the #1 item after about 10 seconds. It does the same thing if you pick an item from the list. It should allow you to pick whether it does this or not. Also, it does not pop up any little flags that show the names of the places nearby. You only see unmarked pushpins. It also got stuck when I changed from "show nearby" to a city name. It kept going back to the nearby view, and this could not be shut off even by unchecking the "nearby" box.
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 5
When it comes to travel reviews, TripAdvisor is it. The best place to get a review.

I like how on this app, it is possible to find the place you have looking for with such few keystrokes. Sometimes the place you are looking for pops up before you know it.

I wish it was possible to change the year and write a review farther back. There are some places I've stayed at several years ago, and my memories of them are still fresh, and I would like to write about them.

I also wish it was possible to edit one's own review after the fact or add pictures to it. Sometimes I write a review. I then find pictures a few days or even a few years after the fact that I wish I could add to it.
Version 6.6 2013-04-23 4
This is excellent software, getting better.  Not there yet.

Map functions freeze and lock unexpectedly, might be network related, but might not be too.

Map zoom function is oddly disconnected from the selection.  I look at a property in the detail view, then click to see on map, and then zooming the map causes the selected property to recede into the mass of other flags.  It's hard to view a selected property in context of the larger map.  This is highly counter-intuitive and should be addressed.

Search and other functions work well and nimbly.  Interface is attractive and easy to understand. I like the owner response function, very enlightening.

Overall, this app and network seems less puerile than Yelp and therefore more reliable.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 4
Travel a lot for work in the US and now globally. Also love to travel on my own time off and Trip Advisor is great. It has a lot of information. It is very helpful - from St. Louis to San Isidro. I highly recommend it to novice and seasoned travelers alike!  It is also easy to use and has a lot of really useful functionalities. Just remember that the reviews come from users so you should read a few before making a decision - and even potential check another source just for reference. And remember that it doesn't work if you are off line! So make sure - especially if you are traveling somewhere where you may not have data service to have a source handy that isn't dependent on being 'connected.' But then again - when are we ever not connected any more!
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 4
This app has been a great addition to my travel planning toolset! I've had a few learning curve issues, and kind of wish that it was easier to sort/filter search results. But, to get around that issue I've really just changed the way I use the app. Now it's my go-to when I want information on a SPECIFIC hotel vs. when I want to browse hotels in a city... Although I still like the TripAdvisor website for 'browsing'. :). Anyway, my favorite feature of the app is the ability to quickly browse actual photos of a property posted by people who have recently been there. It's much faster/easier to do this on my phone vs. the website.  Either way,  I look forward to contributing to the TripAdvisor content after my next hotel stay!

Genco is an old world Italian restaurant, the sandwiches are the best in town. When you walk in you feel like you are being greeted by family, and the soup tastes every bit as good as grandmas soup. That is because everything at GENCO'S is homemade with love! A Must have is the wedding soup. I went in and had a small bowl, I was so sorry I didn't get some to bring home. 
I live in Boca Raton, and I drive to Fort Lauderdale just for one of there great sandwiches. All are excellent, hard to recommend on over the other. So keep going in and decide for yourselves!!!

Address for Genco is
257-B Commercial Blvd, Lauderdale By the Sea.

Also in case you are wondering I am not related in any way!Just love this place :)

As a frequent traveler, I know that sometimes it's tough to find the just right hotel, restaurant or thing to do.  Mostly I look to TA for hotel ratings and restaurant reviews.  I read maybe the last 4-6 months worth of reviews of a place and always read with a critical eye knowing some folks are just always happy with whatever they experience and others are just always critical.  Love also getting a non-US traveler's perspective, esp. a European's take on things.  Also love offering my own personal reviews, although I've only just begun writing them.  Feel like its time for me to give back and help my fellow world explorers and at heart nomads!

When I've traveled, I do a ton of research of where I want to eat - I've got guidebooks, articles, you name it. I didn't have time to do this for my recent trip to Florence. I've liked Tripadvisor for reviews, so I thought I'd download it to my iPad. On this trip, I've been responsible for selecting where we go to dinner each night. This app is outstanding.I'm able to scan restaurants within easy walking distance to our hotel and get a sense of the restaurant, and see if there's consensus about a restaurant, and look at pictures. Every restaurant I've picked so far has been a big hit with my travel companions, all thanks to TripAdvisor. You need this app.
Version 5.9 2012-01-04 5
We use TripAdvisor every time we travel. One of our favorite things on vacation is to try places we don't have at home.  What better way to try a new restaurant than to see where other travelers had a good experience and places the locals frequent and like.  We have found lots of great hidden diamonds out there. Thanks TripAdvisor for never letting us down.......even when it's a recommendation to stay away from places that were bad experiences!  I also like to rate places here in our home town that travelers should not miss or should avoid.   Big thanks also to the other TripAdvisor contributors for taking the few minutes it takes to post their ratings.  Love this app!!

Traveling the world by sailboat, the part I love best is getting off of it and onto land to see, do, and eat stuff. Thanks to my TripAdvisor app, I know just what I want to get myself into.

It's intuitive interface makes it easy to use and, like the website, it's collection of thoughtful reviews save me a lot of valuable travel time.

Why by the app instead of just using the website? For me, it just so that I can get to it faster than I could looking for wherever I might have bookmarked it. What would make it even better? An offline version, since one of the things I'm always looking for wherever I go is an Internet connection.

Version 7.1.1 2013-08-29 5
We really enjoy this app while traveling. When you're on the road and you're ready to stop to eat, this is a great app to find a good place. We have found some really good places to eat that we would not have known about. Having a map to get you there also helps. 

One small issue I have is that when you ask what's near you, or when you use a filter, not everything shows up.  An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel.  It didn't show up on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location it didn't show up in the search.  But, when I searched by name, there was the pub and reviews.
Version 7.0.1 2013-09-19 1
I'm surprised at all the very positive reviews of this app. It seemed to me that this app is not at all designed well for tourists. Here's why:

1. There is no way to save location for viewing offline. Your favorites are saved, but accessible only when you have access to the Internet, so if you've looked up a restaurant, but don't remember exactly where it is, you'll have to use international roaming just to check the map and see how close you are.

2. The search function does not allow you to apply new filters while keeping your previous ones. If I searched for $ and $$ restaurants in Prague, and then wanted to narrow the search to exclusively Czech food, for instance, it would erase the price limitations and show me $$$ and $$$$ Czech restaurants.

I ended up relying much more on recommendations from friends and blogs, which I then loaded onto Apple maps, which I could access offline. If only Yelp would go international!
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
A top-notch tool for travel planning - never leave home without it.  We also use it in our home town.  With so many options in restaurants, lodging and activities and so little time, what could be better than getting advice from people who have actually experienced a place?  Word of mouth proves to be the most reliable way to evaluate a location.  TripAdvisor feedback comes from generally experienced travelers who are willing to share their advice with others.  The information is reliable, updated, informative and valuable.

This app now provides links to phone numbers, emails and websites.  Count on TripAdvisor and get involved.  You will love it!
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 4
We've used this site recently for a trip to Europe, a trip to New York City, and planning a conference in Oregon. TripAdvisor was extremely helpful for all these uses, especially for hotels.  I particularly appreciate knowing the type of trip people are on and the comments help me judge whether the positive or negative experience would apply to me. A great example was one hotel in Germany near a church where the bells ring all night. One reviewer said it was charming and gave a high rating. It would have driven me nuts!!! The mapping feature is helpful for figuring out logistics and the ability to make reservations for many restaurants directly from the site is great. It really offers one stop shopping and planning.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-18 5
As a parent of a small child, this app has been unexpectedly invaluable in finding things to do close to home.  It helped me locate several great parks with children's activities, a model farm with a petting zoo, a bird observatory, and several small museums.   This app is great to have to plan weekend activities with kids, even of you aren't traveling.

Also great for figuring out what to do / eat if you're in a not-so-touristy city.  My husband and I frequently end up in places like Portland MN, Sacramento, Phoenix for each others' business trips and conferences, and its helpful having this app to figure out what to do all day.
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 3
I like this app but it seems like they only developed it halfway. I can think of many features that would improve it and make it truly useful while traveling. As it is, it's ok but could be a million times better. I hope they continue developing it.

For example, why doesn't the map update results when I zoom or move the map? Why no breadcrumbs so I don't have to hit the back button many times? Why no smart search and navigation that remembers my search and clicks? User experience is really incomplete. Makes it difficult to really use. 

Since it's a travel app, should be optimized to work quicker since many parts of the world have slow Internet speeds. Slow and freezes if I challenge it with a few clicks.

Mostly I hate that it only works in landscape. Come on!
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 3
I love Tripadvisor on the web and just recently loaded the iPad app. It's OK but I miss the website. For one thing, I don't see where on the app you can mark a review as "helpful," which is a nice aspect of the website and, as a reviewer myself, a much appreciated aspect of the process. In addition, you cannot see a reviewer's profile. Also, the process for putting items in your saved file can be a bit clumsy and misleading. If you add an item your saved file sometimes tells you there are only 2 items in your file when in reality you might have 10. In order to see your complete folder you have to access it from the bar at the top of the page instead of in the list for the city you're already in.   This could be a great app if this stuff were fixed.
Version 8.5 2014-03-11 5
I have the app on my phone and iPad. I turn first to them for hotel and dining recommendations at home or in some exotic destination. We do 2-4 major trips a year. I've seen hotels rated a 4 that in my opinion were really a 5. If you read the most current reviews you will get the best feel for the hotel. Dining is more subjective and the rating don't always meet my expectations. Again look for the ones written in the last few days. An extra I really like are the street maps and metro guides. Very hard to get lost if you use their guide. Very easy to find how to get to your destination. Overall, the guides are the best travel tools one could use.
Version 5.8 2011-12-12 5
This new app is easy to use and directs me to my pertinent searches quickly. All the same information that is available on the full online version is available on this app.  Tripadvisor in general has never let me down.  People seem to make honest assessments of their experiences, giving great thought to their opinions.  Sometimes one person will rate a hotel with one-star because it's a party hotel, and five reviewers later will rate it a five-star for the very same reason!  But reading these different opinions helps me decide if the hotel will be right for me.  I've yet to be disappointed by any of my selections based on Tripadvisor reviews. Thank you!
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-11 5
I use this app for everything from restaurant searches to forums on market shopping in foreign countries. It has saved me from buying from illegit retailers, helped me pick hotels and rooms and guided in restaurant searches. I am careful when reading reviews to see if there is a consistency- mindful of places that have people write their own reviews but if you look carefully, they are easily spotted. Not everyone values same things in food and pricing but overall , I can get a good idea if I'm looking for places to eat, stay and shop etc. I find this an invaluable app.  Map and phone come in handy as well.
Version 5.92 2012-01-26 4
This app has proven to be quite useful for planning trips. Has a great interface for the iPad 2. I love reading all the reviews. They seem to be consistent. The one thing I would add, or change is being able to type in the hotel you want and nearby restaurants instead of having to search restaurants separately. At least, I am having trouble with this. Maybe it's there, I just haven't figured it out. Would also love to be able to put in I'd fervent pins on the map (for instance, one pin for seaworld, one for hotel and one for restaurants nearby). Ok, so maybe three things, I just thought of one more: being able to refine your hotel search. For this trip I'm planning, I am looking for hotels with kitchenettes, etc. great overall app though!
Version 7.1.1 2014-03-10 3
I am reviewing a budget find hence the lower star rating but within this category it's a 4 or 5. We are an older couple and asked to have a first floor room with bath. It was perfect. The atmosphere is very casual and the staff were wonderful bending over backward for anybody. Everyone speaks English.  If you do reserve they will send directions in English and Thai so the taxi drivers can find it. Max,the owner, is quite a character. He is an ex airline pilot and can regale you with stories (if you want). MHC is Mile high club. The sky train is within one block. And that will get you anywhere (that we wanted ). Because of the protests in Bangkok the traffic is worse than usual so the train is a fast and easy way to get around   The price of MHC is low and we were pleasantly surprised
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-06 4
I use this app a lot. It is good for reading other people's reviews and I can completely write and submit my reviews right here on my mobile device. Missing from this app: ability to review a draft of my review before hitting go, and the ability to see all the reviews I've written. Also, I have to know the exact name of a place to search for it unless I use "near me now." Any spelling errors, or you get the words out of order, and you're out of luck. Or I can browse. And -- finally -- I stopped submitting photos of places I visit because too many of them were inexplicably being declined. If they were declined for being too large, the system should be able to automatically reduce them.
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 3
This app has a lot of nice features, but still frustrates the hell out of me! Please take cues from app "hotels"!!!

- why display all points on a map with basic uninformative "pins"???
+ replace the useless green pins with some color coded boxes : avg or current price inside the box, plus color for reviews! no need to on each pin to find out if it's worth checking out!

-  Please display availability if at all possible! 

- when you select an hotel, please allow for full screen map, and display a popup with all information, instead of switching to different view. No need to click "back" all the time!
+ on average, when I'm looking for an hotel, I will check 10-30 hotels. This is tedious, so it would be nice to save a few "clicks / taps" when possible...
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-11 5
Thanks to the staff and management for making my 1st trip to London so fabulous! From uniforms (doorman especially) to spotless rooms and common spaces it was unexpected quality and service.   Dinning is A+ but being from the US I didn't get the pork and beans on the breakfast buffet. Try a steak sandwich in the tea area it's wonderful along with the cute and  delicious little bites they serve with tea. Too posh. No need to prebook tours in US the Concierge staff can do it and know more about the sites.
Basically, I loved this place, so I'm planing a trip to London by myself and feel totally secure,safe, and familiar with the area and hotel! Cee ya soon.

Version 5.92 2012-01-22 5
I love this app, I have only been using for a short time but it has already prevented me from making a couple bad decisions. We recently booked a cruise and are looking for a place to stay the day before we depart and a couple of days after we come back. A lot of the hotels around the Miami area look nice on their web site but after I read some of the reviews from people who stayed in these places, it made me think twice. I don't want to spend a lot of money on a hotel, but I also don't want to rune what I hope to be a great vacation with a miserable last couple of days because we stay at a bad hotel. I believe this App is going to help me avoid this mistake.
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 2
I am a big trip advisor user, and am happy they have an app, but it is *useless* if you are in a place where you don't have data!

For example, I'm in Thailand. I have wifi at my hotel, make some plans using TA and save some places. Walk out of the hotel and it is all gone. Not only are the saves not available offline, even the restaurant that was on my screen gets wiped out and I'm back to the home screen when I go back to the app a few minutes later.

If you are going to go through the trouble of making an app, take advantage of what a native app allows you to do, like keep state and store data!!!!

I should also be able to:
- write reviews for uploading later
- add new places that are not in the TA database (this part is super frustrating when you are off the beaten path).

I look forward to seeing the improvements.
Version 6.2 2012-07-16 5
Every software developer decides what features they are going to provide to the user community.   While each user likely has ideas about other features they would add, no one piece of software can be all things to all people.  Therefore I give this Ap the highest rating possible.   I base this on the fact that for the features the developers have chosen to provide, they have done so very well.  I have searched both Aps and other computer software and found nothing compared to Trip Advisor.  

With that stated, only a good non-complicated trip planner that interfaced with this software could take Trip Advisor to the next level.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-11 3
I'd use Tripadvisor more to find restaurants but the search filters are too limited. For example, you can't use Tripadvisor to search for a place that serves alcohol, or not. You can't search for, say, a romantic ambience. A restaurant may have a 5 star rating but not be the type of restaurant you want - there must be a better way to sort them into genres.  Then there is the issue that contributors tend to either rave or rant with their ratings:  there never seems to be an "average" restaurant, even though many are.  I enjoy writing reviews for Tripadvisor but there is mo way to edit them; I can't even fix a typo error let alone change my review later when I gain more knowledge about a place. So I use Yelp! More often. Refine it, Tripadvisor. You'll never get bigger 'til you do.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
We used Trip advisor on our iPad to plan a one month trip to Morocco and Spain. With two notable exceptions all of our hotels cost less than $90, sometimes a lot less. I researched all the hotels in two days by reading the excellent reviews available on the Ap. We were not disappointed with any of them, and most exceeded our expectations. Once we were there we used Trip Advisor to find us restaurants, again,we were favorable impressed.

We are not inexperienced travelers, but this trip was the best organized and the one with the best value for the prices paid. That was all because of Trip Advisor and it's foolproof Ap. It never failed us.
Version 5.8 2011-09-03 2
Very difficult to book lodgings directly from the app.  Few B&Bs have the "Check Availability" option.  For those that do, there's no availability calendar:  you have to search specific dates.  For the trip I'm trying to plan, my dates are flexible, so the availability search turned into a guessing game:  "Will these dates work?  No.  How about these dates?  No.  How about these?" Worse, the "alternative" properties that were offered for the search dates weren't B&Bs -- they were motels and low-end hotels, many of which were in completely different resorts, and none of which were at all useful.  Plus there were no links to properties' websites, so I couldn't go to those sites to check availability.  Essentially, for B&Bs, this app provides a list of rankings and a collection of reviews for each -- other than that, you're on your own.
Version 6.6 2013-04-12 4
There is no more helpful tool when researching travel. It is chocked full of helpful info. If you don't use it, you are crazy. I have one request. If you are looking for B&B's, there is no way to get to the whole ranked list for a city. I was surprised to be infuriated with this wonderful app when trying to get to this simple category when looking for it for Edinburgh. There needs to be clickable access on every b&b review to get back to the master list and in the drop-down HOTEL menu b&b needs to be a choice. Sorry to complain but who needs to get infuriated just trying to get to the treasure trove of info. Shouldn't happen. Keep doing a wonderful job but please fix this.
Version 6.4 2012-09-10 2
TA seems to have great potential but has only been a little helpful. Used it while in Japan and was able to find some stuff but "ALL" the distances were wrong and in miles but Japan is in kilometers. Also there were over 15 places to eat in a 7 mile radius but TA said the closest please was 12 miles away. There should be an option to change between metric or us systems and an option to add a place that is not in TA. On the good side of things most of the places in TA had many pictures and reviews and I was able to copy foreign langue reviews and paste them into my translator all from my phone. Something else nice to add would be more offline information. My biggest problem with a lot of apps is that you have to be online and when traveling away from your home country that can be very difficult and/or costly.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
I use Trip Advisor on line for all my travel plans.  And, I am delighted with this application!  I can find a place to eat something to do in must minutes from where I am - important when trying to avoid whining children or grumpy spouses!  Our trips to New York and Orlando using Trip Advisor meant great meals every time.  We would plan some of the big events ahead of time - like Broadway shows - but wanted to be able to be impromptu and decide on some things at the last minute - the United Nations tour, or shopping at local fun stores.  I always download the new city guides on to my iphone before travel!
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
My wife and I are traveling around the US in our RV on a year long honeymoon (we wish you could too).  We have really random, sometimes bizarre interests and Trip Advisor has really helped us pinpoint the cool things in our locations that even the locals verify as favorites.  That's not been the case so much with other aps which, through our experience, seem
to be more for the people who'd rather be seen trying to have fun than actually having fun.   The ap for iPhone is really easy to use and the reviews are informative and entertaining.  This is one of our favorites in our road-trip toolbox.
Version 6.3 2012-07-13 5
There's something really special and exciting about planning a trip based on crowd sourced user experiences and recommendations.  So much more relevant than any travel brochure or google search result.  The app makes it really easy to find out all the best places and things to do wherever you are or planning to go.  

Even if I'm not traveling, I enjoy browsing the app on the way to work - reading about other people's wonderful travel recommendations takes me out of the boring 9-5 and really motivates me to want to see the world more.

5 stars for great community driven content.
Version 6.6 2012-10-14 3
I want to like this app, since I use the website constantly, but the Save function only works sporadically. Is the app passive-aggressively telling me I shouldn't go to that particular restaurant? I don't know, but the random lack of ability to save a place is annoying as all #%&! The second bug is with Saved Trips. In list view, it shows Ft. Worth (16) for instance (my aunt lives there, we visit a lot. Don't judge.) So it knows I have 16 items saved in that list. But when I go into view them in detail, now it shows 0. And finally, a the newest bug, the one that prompted me to finally write a review... The back button caused the entire UI to fall apart. Pieces misaligned, background didn't load, completely jumbled and unusable. Was using TA on an iPad2 in iOS 5 & 6.
Version 8.3 2013-12-31 5
This app is so useful in my life. I tell all my friends to use it. My family travels a lot so, when we're in a new city, TripAdvisor is my go-to app. With it, we experience the best each city has to offer. What people may be surprised to know, is that I use it for local inspirations too; whether it's for ideas for fun things to do with the kids, a romantic night out with the hubby, a great place for a girls' night out, or a weekend trip to the mountains, TripAdvisor is truly the best advisor for great places to stay, eat, and things to do. It hasn't let us down yet. Thanks for the great advice TripAdvisor!
Version 5.92 2012-02-08 3
This app is good for reading reviews but that is about all you can do with it.

This app lacks the following functionality (which I would love to see in a future release):
- the ability to view and manage my account info. I cant even see my past reviews!
- the ability to book travel arrangements  such as by linking to any of the popular travel sites. When I find a great hotel, I should be able to book a room! Wouldn't this help them make money, as they do with their website?
- the ability to visit an establishment's website from its profile. This is a no brainer, how could they have overlooked this?
- the ability to check in to location would be nice too.

I love the Tripadvisor web service but this app simply does not do it justice.
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 5
We are on the last day of a one week long, unplanned, seat of our pants, vacation all over Southern California.  This was our first time in California and our first time using TripAdvisor.  In the past choosing lodging and restaurants has been very stressful. This time, though we had not preplanned anything, TripAdvisor helped make it our most relaxed and carefree vacation ever.  It was great not having to worry that we did not know what we did not know.  With TripAdvisor we confidently made great activity, meal, and lodging decisions, on the fly.  

Most relaxed vacation ever thanks to TripAdvisor.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
We've used TripAdvisor online for years: couldn't plan a trip without it. The iPad app is fantastic while we're on the trip, making finding nearby restaurants a snap. Great mixture of maps, reviews, photos right in the moment when we're hungry and making a dining decision. The only drawback at the moment is that not all restaurants nearby show up on the local search. We saw an attractive restaurant while we were walking around our vacation rental neighborhood, and didn't find it later in the app. I guess we'll need to eat there and then write the first review. The app is a great resource.
Version 6.6 2013-04-29 4
I've been using this app to plan and manage an overseas trip. It has Ben great so far withstand couple of minor issues. When left running in the background on some modes, I think it keeps location services on which seems to be draining my battery faster than usual. I'm not sure if it is that, or in just using it more than normal. It'd be great if there was a way to see my "saves" sorted by distance as well as a way to mark them as seen. Finally, when I'm using this while traveling, I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review, but remind me later waits about 5 minutes and them pesters me again, so a star off for that.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
I've been planning a late May/early June trip to Hawaii and have spent countless hours online researching best deals, info about hotels, etc.  I've finally booked this afternoon thru Expedia, but couldn't have done it without the fantastic information available on TripAdvisor!!  From hotel rankings to "what to do" activities to the forum (a GREAT resource!), TripAdvisor has it all!!  I won't travel again without checking TA.  :-)  P.S.  Expedia continues to amaze me with their deals and their customer service is top notch.  In my opinion, the travel insurance they offer is the best out there.
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5
This is a very reliable source to search before and during travel. While Yelp is convenient, trip advisor has much more to offer. Beware of the false reports out of Trip Advisor's hands. Look at how many good AND bad reviews from an individual before taking their advice. If they have 1 bad review and no other reviews, the review is most likely false and was completed out of revenge. Not everyone uses the stars the way they should, either. It is not correct to provide stars due to establishment being closed. You merely advise trip advisor in a different manner.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
Every time we go on vacation, my husband and I wonder what people did in the days before this website/app. The reviews for hotels and restaurants are invaluable. We rarely go to a restaurant without checking them first. Having this app is like having a hotel concierge at your fingertips 24/7! There was a link to Open Table at one point so you could connect with one tap to make reservations, but I'm not seeing that anymore, unless I just haven't looked up restaurants connected with Open Table recently. I loved that feature. Again awesome app!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
I use this app all the time when visiting a new city to see what is the best thing to do as rated by other users.  Having the top ten or great things to do in a new location is the best way to spend what little time or money you have.  I have used in Las Vegas to pick a show and in FL to decide which tour to use.  In both cases the reviews were right on and this app is a great way to access that information without all the hassle of browsing the web. Using it this weekend to pick a restaurant in Big Bear, CA. The app is dependent on people putting in useful reviews which is usually the case.
Version 8.0.2 2014-01-05 1
Do not waste your money. What a disappointment. Went there first time tonight, they don't have sushi here, only sashimi. They were out of salmon! That should have been a red flag. You don't get to pick your sashimi, it's chef choice! I chose a three fish sashimi, it came with two kind of fish, fake tuna and cheap tilapia white fish , they forgot the third fish and it wasn't until I reminded the waitress that they sent the thirst fish. I wanted eel and the waiter recommended an eel dish with three pieces, ya, it came with one piece of eel cut into three pieces and whole bunch of cucumber salad for 13$. Overall we paid 89$ for two rice balls, some side salads and few pieces of fish that I didn't care for. Worst of all their attitude, not only they were not acknowledging that they were cheating you, the head waitress, kept arguing that it was really three pieces of eel. Awful place! Never will go back.
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 5
Because of our mother's illness, I visited my family in a city hundreds of miles from my hometown.  My brother, who is the assistant manager of one of the hotels in his area, asked me if I'd write a review about the inn he works at on a website called Trip Advisor.  I checked out the website and then downloaded the app for my iPad and I highly recommend this app - it's interesting, helpful, and (after posting my review of my brother's workplace and reading what over 30 others had to say about his motel) highly accurate.  Look forward to using it over and over again.
Version 5.93 2012-03-10 3
After reviewing and selecting a site to book through, I entered all my contact and payment information. User-friendly and normal.
I elected to review the policy since I chose a site I had never used before; after reading the policy my only options were 'Menu' and 'Return to TripAdvisor'. Menu was clearly not the correct choice, so I selected 'Return to TripAdvisor'. Instead of being returned to page where I had already entered all my information, I was returned to the very first screen of selecting my hotel stay dates. I had to completely start my search over again! It felt like I was being punished for wanting to stay informed and review the fine print.
If you are detail-oriented, use a different site to book your trip.
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
My wife & used this app while touring Northern Michigan & the Upper Peninsula. We wanted no schedule, but were very interested in finding nice accommodations and good food at interesting places - where the locals eat - TripAdvisor SCORED for us on BOTH!

The App is easy to use, informative, ability to give all the great spots & even many great but not-too-well-known locations, and the search functions gets options others miss, while directions are usually very good. However as good as all those functions are - it was the reviews from other travelers that absolutely sealed the deal!
Version 5.9 2011-11-21 5
I got this app while on my honeymoon in Italy, and man has it been on the money! Where to eat, where to visit, what tours to take. With reviews pictures and maps, this quickly became an invaluable resource to have on our trip. So far, we have used it for booking tours and finding GOOD places to eat. Helping us avoid the tourist traps and scams you will most definitely find when you travel to heavy tourist destinations. Not bad for a free App. It has even encouraged me to add to the reviews to make our voice count when someone is out there looking for advise.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-17 4
I stayed here 4 nights for business and most flaws are not the fault of the hotel, just where it is.  I have stayed in Frankfurt before, closer to downtown and enjoyed that more.  Internet is expensive, but quick.  Hotel staff was very friendly.  Executive lounge was a nice perk, but only got that because I needed to have Internet for work.  Good gym, although there could have been more signage regarding use of sauna, etc, 

During a grey raining week, not much to walk to when not working.  TV options very limited and not well spelled out.

Would never avoid the hotel, but would opt for closer options if available.
Version 6.2 2012-07-10 5

Version 6.6 2012-12-28 4
I personally think this app is better than the web ver for two reasons; easy to look on the small screen and the simple user interface.
It is definitely not user-hostile, but not quite user friendly sometimes, though.
For example, if I want to find a place to go near where I am, the app picks up several places to choose from.
But it is not clear what leads to this order.
To sort it as users' favor, I need to click the sort and filter button and choose rating.
This was not clear when I boot up for the first time, and left me confused for a while.
Anyways, it is well-built app for some minor interface difficulties.
Version 6.0 2012-03-30 5
This app is great for people that travel or if you want to find the best of anything near you or anywhere for that matter.  I use it all the time when I travel to find hotels, recreation, food, shopping.  It is a must have app.  I think there is nothing more telling, good or bad to a place than the reviews from ordinary people who have been customers.  Not only helps you, but helps others too and I have gotten an immediate response from the places that I have given poor review to.  These businesses read our reviews and they mean  a lot of business to them.  Join the calvary and help set things straight.
Version 6.6 2012-10-17 5
I enjoy being able to quickly search for thing where I am or where I plan to be and how simple it is to us. I like the ability to review a place right from my phone. I only wish there was some way for reviews to include a scale/rating on how much your review is based on the Place/business versus other patrons. I've read some reviews that were bad but they rated them such because of thing/issues/events that were not the responsibility or fault of the business, such as a crying baby poolside at a hotel, don't rate the hotel poorly because of that.
Version 6.6 2013-02-18 2
TripAdvisor's content is excellent--they've been around forever, and aren't one of the top travel-related websites for nothing. Most of the high marks given to this app seem to reflect this, rather than the app itself. Given their standing, however, I think the app leaves a lot to be desired. It is fairly uninspiring in its presentation of the rich content that TripAdvisor has, is pretty slow, and crashes more than it should. 

Also, a minor comment on the content side: it's not always clear how the rankings of restaurants/hotels are done. For example, "Jungle Junction Family Entertainment" is currently the #1 restaurant in Siem Reap, Cambodia--out of 256 options. Meanwhile, it has 68 reviews, while the #2 restaurant has 519. It seems a bit more thought could be given to this...
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
I've been using Trip Advisor for many years now. I find jt interesting to see what others say about a resort or restaurant before going. I have come to the conclusion that you can only tell so much with a review. I have loved and recommended places that others have thought were only so-so and vice versa!  There is no accounting for taste or preferences and everyone experiences things differently. Now, I take things that are written with a grain of salt and realize that you just have to do it on your own to know what's going go make you happy!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-06 2
Why can't you make it capable of staying on the last place or page used if user has to go away from the app to do something else?  Stupid lack of functionality...

Often I just go to Safari and use the web app to insure that I don't have to start all over again for my search using the iPad app.  

There is some good functionality but it is far from wholly useable.  The map search is pretty good, but still has some issues if geo-coding isn't right...

Can't just cut over and use only this... Still reliant on the web browser version... What's the point if you have to use two pieces of software?

Also, it is really annoying when wifi drops and app goes back to the beginning...makes me want to pull my hair out.
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 5
I've travelled on every continent except Antarctica including over 50 countries and have spent time in every US state except North Dakota.  I consult Trip Advisor first when planning any trip -- my experience is that it is generally valid feedback from real consumers.  I think it is easy to identify the people who are impossible to please and write negative feedback about everything.  I judge whether or not the establishment takes the time to address their concerns.  And if the establishment doesn't care about their customers, it will be reflected in multiple ratings.
Version 6.6 2013-01-06 5
The first thing I do before planning for a trip is to check on Trip Advisor the ratings and reviews of hotels in my destination and the reviews of restaurants as well as things to do.  I find the information extremely relevant and useful. Sometimes, I also go back to the reviews after my stay at the hotel or after my restaurant experience so I compare notes with fellow travelers and  try to benchmark with my own experience. It makes for a rich and rewarding travel assistance.  Definitely an App worth using, an indispensable travel companion.
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 4
I have always loved trip advisor!  I recommend it whenever someone is traveling.  
It's nice for me to have it portable now since I have always had a desktop computer and I am old fashioned and still have a dumb phone!LOL  The only thing that I find frustrating is that many sites use adobe flash and my IPad isn't compatible?  I guess?  This is my first attempt at an apple product so I'm still learning.  So my frustration isn't with trip advisor, but with my IPad.  Trip advisor rocks have used it for years!  Its saved me from wasting money at lame destinations and helped me find the small out of the way spots that are exactly what I was looking for.

Strength of this app lies in the people who submit reviews.  The larger the number,  the more likely that the outliers are overshadowed by the vast majority of opinions. By looking at the percentage that are excellent or very good, you get a true sense of what to expect. 
Hotel reviews would be helped out if one could search by multiple criteria.  For example, listing the most popular hotels , the list can be quite disparate and not that helpful. It is unlikely that the person looking to stay at a Ritz Carleton is going to choose "Bruce's Best Hotel" even though the people who went there loved it !  
Overall very helpful.

Once you figure out how to read between the lines of some reviewers material, this is a valuable resource.
I always check here when getting a bargain on a hotel to see if its even worth staying there. Most of the time the reviewers or spot on.
If someplace gets mostly positive responses, it's usually good to go. 
A person is more likely to complain about an issue versus commending an establishment for meeting or exceeding their expectations, so read between the lines.
I use it every time I travel for hotels and attractions, don't leave home without it.

Approx. 17 miles north of San Antonio, in the hill country, you'll find this gem. Yes, it's Mexican dining but they have a real gift for putting together the ingredients your already familiar with in ways you've never experienced. Plus they have some family recipes that will surprise and delight you as well. If you're lucky you'll have Carlos as your waiter and he'll add to your experience with his low-key wit and recommendations. As if the food wasn't reason enough to go, find a seat outside with a terrific view of the Texas Hill Country.
Version 7.1 2013-07-16 2
For several years, I've taken the app all over N. America and Europe letting the app guide me to fantastic dining and lodging.  The last several versions, though, have really let me down.  While the content is still second to none, a key piece of functionality now fails to perform.  My favorite use of the app is to navigate to the restaurants area, filter to the minimum distance, sort by rating, and find great food.  Now, I'm often pointed to a geography some distance from me (right now, I'm at the Mansfield Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, and am routed to restaurants in St James, NY) and I find that the paging functionality loses the filter criteria after page 1.  As a result, I'm feeling a real loss--no other app has the content, but this one is quite diminished in usefulness.
Version 6.1 2012-06-05 3
Overall, a decent app., however, it has some shortcomings. The first one is that TA uses Bing, which is, as always with Microsoft products, far inferior to other mapping software (e.g. Google Maps). Second, it is sometime, if not often, difficult to display larger groupings, or even pages, of attractions or destinations. Third, there are sometimes issues with mapping over small areas - nothing shows on the map, for example, even thought there ought to be places. Finally, the ratings of various listings often seems inconsistent, especially where there aren't many reviews.

Otherwise, it is generally attractive and has a fair amount of information if you're willing to wade through the deficiencies.
Version 6.6 2012-12-04 4
I think this is the best place you can find for your stay in Kathmandu.  The Hotel sill has the Tea House Nepali charm 
along with the modern conveniences we want in a city hotel.  The Garden is one of the biggest draws to the Hotel.  The tables sit under bi, beautiful shade trees where you can enjoy all meals.

The Staff truly makes this a home away from home.  Everyone, from the desk manager, "Bijay," always helpful with that Nepali joy and welcome smile to the waiters and room cleaners make your stay an experience where you'll not want to leave.  All of the staff do their best to fulfill any requests pleasantly and helpfully.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-28 4
I love this site, the app aggravates me bc of frequent crashing on iPad! I use full site abt half the time- but this site is the best when it comes to unbiased reviews!! I contribute frequently and have saved money & time with advisor! Highly recommend this app/site! It can help make the most of your time when traveling, help avoid bad hotels, etc! I love the fact that there aren't pop ups, that you can also start conversations, ask questions and that you can run a search w updates if future plans are a few weeks off. Overall it's well designed but PLEASE stop w the annoying crashes!
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 3
I love to use Trip Advisor to find things to do, hotels and restaurants for places I'm traveling to, but when trying to look through the listings and seeing where they are on the map, the map and lists keep resetting back to the original view which is very frustrating because you keep losing your place and have to start over again.  This makes it really to difficult to use for more than just casually browsing for ideas.  Then you have to switch to a real PC browser or different app to do more research.  Disappointing because if this worked correctly this would be a great app to find everything you need for travel all in one place.
Version 8.5 2014-03-01 5
We went on a cross-country road trip from California to the East Coast and back...with only one reservation ahead of time.  We used Trip Advisor to help us find clean hotels that were affordable--and it helped us avoid hotels with low ratings.  We also used Trip Advisor to help us find our now favorite hotel right near Disneyland.  We are annual pass holders and sometimes like to spend the night down in Anaheim, even though we only live about 1 1/2 hours away...Trip Advisor helped us find the Ayres Hotel Anaheim, and we are about to book our 3rd stay there!
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 4
Great app, sows all hotels, restaurants, activities and provides you with tons of CONFLICTING information in the " reviews" section. The same hotel or restaurant can be the best ever or totally disgusting, have great service or the spawn of Satan! Apps like open table or frommers  or zagats will give you a professional rating in addition to all the freaks with wildly different expectations so that you can make informed decisions. Travel Advisor's rating system is the saving grace. Otherwise you're at the mercy of anyone who thinks themselves worldly or knowledgeable-in the end leaving you without a clue of where to stay or eat!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 2
This app would be wonderful IF 

1) When one selects See On Map, one could actually see the place zoomed in enough on the map that you can actually find it. If you try to zoom in, it loses the location, making this function almost worthless except to find out the general region. 

2) When saving potential Things to Do, Hotels, or Restaurants, the app does not remember where you were in the list, and instead, goes back to the beginning. You then have to alternately scroll down and press the Next 10 link through the many pages back to where you were. Really annoying.

3) My Saves could be grouped into the various categories, rather than all thrown in together. It makes going back to find something later a chore.
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5
I love this app! I learned the hard way that for me the bad reviews should be read first. Take note of how many and if they are all saying the same thing. If there are no red flags in the bad reviews then I hit the good ones! This has greatly increased the chance that I will agree with the previous reviews. I suspect that some good reviews are planted by the businesses themselves. Just my opinion! If you make a bad choice you can look back on the bad reviews and get a good laugh out of the mistake that you made!  It has helped me get over wishing I had done something else! Good luck!
Version 6.6 2013-01-10 3
Imagine the hard work that the groundskeeper, maintenance, housekeeper etc have to do in order for 300 or more guest to have a pleasant stay at each and everyone of these resorts. Only to be told  that base on the review on trip advisor, printed and highlighted by mngmt your performance did not exceed the guest satisfaction. Really!! Six days work week, sixty hours or more, no holidays or weekend off and because the sun wasn't hot enough or the front desk manager didn't wake you up on time...that ruin your entire vacation. So you feel the best way to get even is to tarnish the name of the resort, hence putting people out of jobs. These hardworking people are human beings not robots.
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 3
I'm a big fan of Tripadvisor, mainly because it provides a way for consumers to keep providers honest. However, the ratings don't provide you with the perspective you need to make a decision: a hotel could have fantastic ratings, but all entered by backpackers on a low budget, which isn't useful to you if you're on a business trip and/or looking for something a bit more upscale. More than the rating itself, what I'd like to know is: who are the people providing those ratings? What are their standards?
As for the app itself, I don't like it. I can't find any of my reviews, for example - it isn't personalized to me at all.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-13 5
Very good way to evaluate places to stay, things to do, and places to eat. Was very helpful and accurate source of info on recent trip to Italy and Germany. Remember though some people will knock a place or restaurant for something others find great. Read a couple of reviews and don't focus on one or two. I found you can usually get a feel for the outlier reviews and see if they do or do not refer to your preferences.  I like to refer to it at home too. It's such an awesome tool for planning any trip or outing I don't know what I did before I had it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-06 1
Program is very difficult to use esp if you need to change something ! It defaults to "current location" which is useless (I'm in NYC!!). Prices and facilities rarely match the Guide Michelin, taxes & fees not easy to find (but they're not included) so have fun finding them!!!!
It would be much better if it indicated that the hotel etc. was in the Guide. Prices indicated for a hotel in Rouen was $248/night and up. The Guide was 248 Euros and up. That's a 33% increase and you haven't found the fees and taxes yet!!!
Under facilities (which itself is well hidden) parking etc. is indicated as 18Euros/day  but may or may not be available (and may include additional unstated fees?)??!
Nett nett it's much better to buy the Guide and book from there, this program offers very little advantage (but it does have great pics - that's the hotel pictured?)
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
Of course we all have different tastes and demands, but trip advisor can help anyone if used wisely. First of all reading the reviews other than just looking on the average mark gives usually enough information to make an educated guess and it helps a lot when going to new places or countries. So, use wisely and the app will work for you! My latest discovery is that reviews of restaurants are more reliable than Zagat review, despite the fact that TripAdvisor is free and l paid 10$ for Zagat. Free, helpful and available! Enjoy!
Version 8.5 2014-03-01 5
I travel a lot and it's never let me down whether it be in my home country or traveling international. Useful tips on the forums plus a general idea of what to expect from hotels to restaurants to activities. This site has never let me down. I love that I can click the address and it'll bring it up on my gps system with ease. I don't ever make travel arrangements without first checking on tripadvisior first. Forums are easy to use and I always get plenty of tips and answers when I can't find the information anywhere else.
Version 6.6 2013-03-28 5
This App is hands down the best travel app out there.  Listening to a large consensus of opinions about random businessses, restaurants, hotels, and cities is the best way to find out whether its for you or not. World travelers all know that Travel Advisor is the go-to place to find candid, reliable reviews and comments.

The map add-on GPS hotel locator was very helpful for me!  Being in a third world country and finding where you are certainly and where the hotel is located isn't easy. Travel Advisor is a life savor!
Version 6.2 2012-07-15 4
Remember, the people reviewing amount to an average, meaning many will be far less adventurous and far more inane about things an experienced traveller would ignore. so I suggest using the usual statistical ploy of throwing out the high and low ratings and focusing on the upper middle. if people take the time to review then they have something that really matters to them, but that is usually extreme. people who review as a common curtesy are to be more trusted, even if they too lack perspective of an Anthony Bourdain etc. use this app, contribute to it. 

the interface is a bit quirky at times but it works.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-16 4
Overall the app is helpful while planning a trip and searching reviews. I have had quite a lot of stability issues where the app randomly quits or reverts to the home page, thus deleting your search or attempt to book a place. Also, the search function (at least with the hotels) seems to operate oddly, as I kept getting different orders of hotels for the same search criteria for the same city. I can't really explain the issue, but hopefully it will get figured out when I have more experience with the app. Overall though, a worthy app and great for on-the-fly travel and research.
Version 6.5 2012-09-28 5
Awesome application for everyone whether one likes to travel or not. It tells you everything you have around you along with its reviews. You may find a place new but thousands of us would have visited the place before you. It also let's us to know the price, directions, rating and also gives the link to the official website ( that too opens in the same application). Awesome!!! Isn't it.  they have the application for windows and apple both. Also you can save your past searches. I don't think if anyone needs more than this!!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 4
Overall, this app works pretty well. One of the reasons I sometimes  prefer the website rather than the app is because bookmarking hotels is not convenient. For example, whenever you save a hotel (by marking it with a star), the list goes all the way back to the beginning, making it difficult to see exactly where you left off. As example, if there's a total of 50 results and you happen to bookmark  #41 to your favorites, upon doing so the page automatically goes all the way back to result #1, which is a pain in trying to find where you left off, especially since they're not numbered.
Version 6.6 2013-02-14 5
Traveler reviews and rankings from real people are so much more meaningful than any visitors' bureau or news article.  I love being able to search for just about any attraction, hotel, or restaurant and find out what real people thought of it. I use the "Near me" function a lot, even in my home city, just to see what hidden gems might be out there. And for vacation planning, the "Save" star lets me browse around before I go and keep track of the things I really want to do! I wouldn't change a thing about this app.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 4
I like this app very much. A small feature could make it even better - please add a possibility to share my bookmarks with my fellow-travelers, via email or Dropbox or whatever way, for them to get a list of places I bookmarked and see it in their TripAdvisor app. I'd like them to be able to vote/rate my choice so that we could came to a consent which places to visit. It would be a great trip planning feature that could significantly differentiate TripAdvisor! And finally about a bug I found - the "Back" button disappears in the list on the left after you choose to view a street. This is annoying.
Version 7.1.1 2013-10-10 5
I always read all the reviews while we are traveling on the road. My husband and I crisscross the country every summer and I am the navigator. I find most reviewers to be honest if you read all of them or at least half, you can get a pretty good opinion. Many times I didn't pay attention to a negative review because I thought they had some sort of personal problem and was sorry afterwards. Trip advisor is a good opinion to take into account when you are traveling in a new place and have no idea where to go.
Version 8.2 2013-12-02 5
I travel throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia on the regular monthly basis . I have tried many of the travel guides written up by many notable magazines and were given high recommendations but none tach the usefulness of the tool . 

Some aides focus only in certain regions but even then I have found this tool to provide better advice not only in the same region but worldwide . 

I am a believer and a constant user now and would not leave home without . 

I would most certainly recommend this to anyone .
Version 5.8 2011-08-27 4
Trip Advisor is a solid app that I use every time I plan a trip.  App can be mildly annoying at times, mainly with the zoom on the map.  It would be helpful to keep a group of POI's on the map and not zoom in even while looking at a particular POI in detail.  One downside to Trip advisor is all the info is based on reviews thus uniform info is not necessarily provided for all POI's.  For example, in planning a trip to France, it would be helpful to know how far hotels are from train lines, however this is not always available.  Despite these faults, this app is very easy and has high yield info at your fingertips.
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 5
Rented scooters from A&M for memorial weekend. This was the third time my husband and I have been to the keys and rented scooters. They have been by far the best to rent from. They let us have the scoots from 10am Friday to 4 pm Sunday with only 2 day charge. Others wanted us to pay for an extra day if we did not return in exactly 48 hours. A&M also picked us up from the airport and dropped us back off free of charge.  They were also the best price I could find on the island. They also rent electric cars and bikes. Be sure to check them out.
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 4
The TripAdvisor app is great because it's optimized for iPad, which makes it much easier to use when traveling, compared to using the hotel's computer or lugging along a full-size laptop! Just like the regular website, it's wonderful for quickly getting information on local restaurants, clubs, and other things to do (not only what and where, but also ratings and other useful tips)! Of course, it's also handy for comparing hotels and airfares. Now, IF ONLY you could download stuff on a specific destination in advance, so you could access it offline, THEN it would be PERFECT!
Version 6.5 2012-09-23 4
I check this app daily for feedback on the restaurant I manage as well to see how other establishments are doing. I have left reviews also. I think it should have the date the guest dined at the restaurant or stayed at a hotel. Maybe also add to people not familiar with the app a *note stating that please read our (TP) reviews but please try the establishment out for yourself & make your own review (opinion). Some people make unnecessary comments, some completely fabricate or lie. My restaurant has great reviews so please don't think that is why I am mentioning this. Thanks for listening.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
I never written a review for any app before, period. But this app is so incredibly informative and easy to use that I was inspired to sing it's praises. Instantly find listings and reviews for hundreds of local hotels, restaurants and "things to do". Make your own decisions based on the wealth of info. Rummage through the BS reviews (you'll see what I mean) and discover some real local finds, no matter your location. 

Read the poorly written and/or snobby reviews in funny voices to your kids for some unexpected fun. This app is a blast!
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 1
Very misleading if you happen to pick restaurants in smaller cities by the top number of stars. One has to assume that a number of the breathlessly fawning reviews were simply done by shills. We have consistently been steered wrong by Trip Advisor. 

In one case, the one accurate review was  allowed by Trip Advisor to be rebutted by the restaurant in question. The restaurant trashed the reviewer in a personal way and made several statements that were rank lies (my friends and I had had an identical experience). There's no chat or respond function so when this happens the reviewer (ie, the person who bought this app) can't defend themselves. 

The bottom line is that they have to actually hire a staff to verify their ratings or find a way to eliminate bogus reviews by friends and family that make Trip Advisor unreliable.
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5
The best resource for finding a decent place to stay. I have never been sorry for having read the reviews here. You have to be logical when deciding who to believe, so here is my formula:

What is the over-all rating?
What is the opinion of those people who stayed there recently?
What are the complaints?
What do you want from your stay?
How much do you want to spend? 
Is it worth it?

That formula has always worked for me,  and I depend on Trip Advisor anytime I am unfamiliar with a destination and need a place to stay.
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
this really is a very good app for the ipad.  one thing that annoys me is that the website is so well laid out and easy to navigate but the app takes a little learning to try and figure out where things are.  its not as obvious as on the website.  a little user point of view engineering would be great.  it really is a useful and well functioning app though.

i am a senior contributor and i love reading the reviews of others also.  trip advisor has proved to be a reliable source of information for me.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
What makes this app different is a) it works really well, is simple to navigate, and interfaces with google maps, and) b it's written by the people who use it. I have used trip advisor for ablest the past two years, and travel at least20 times a year. With one exception, one restaurant in Paris, the reviews have been very accurate, helpful, and made our trips, both business and vacation, so much better. thanks for the app, but most of all thanks to all the people who take the time to write reviews!
Version 5.7 2011-07-03 4
After reading all the reviews, we had mixed feelings about trying this place. I'm glad we went over & gave it a try! We left early to try & get a seat-at 6:40 we were the only ones there waiting. Waitress was nice & took care of our needs. It did take 30 minutes to get our food, but it was cooked to order. It did seem as though the regulars got preferential treatment. I had the burrito & and the hubs had the Slim Stack. The burrito was ok but not great-maybe it was my choice of fillings. The Short Stack Pancakes were fantastic! At over an inch a piece, they were more than enough yummy goodness for us both! We'll try it again for sure!!!
Version 6.2 2012-07-14 5
The system of user reviews is now well established. Sometimes the deterrent to use it on the go is the roaming charges on mobile devices but I've come to the conclusion that one terrible experience can do more damage to your holiday than a week of data usage. So now You can find great place to eat, stay at the last moment and is great for people who love to have a flexible schedule and don't like to plan where they will have dinner 4 weeks in advance. Great show trip advisor.
Version 5.5 2011-08-07 4
Tripadvisor is my main source for trip planning, and this app works great with one exception: there is no way to really organize the information for comprehensive planning. There is a "save" option so you can save some things but not all.  

When I'm planning a trip I like to organize everything in Evernote. I save websites, trip reports and reviews from Tripadvisor, restaurant menus, and then I have everything in one place.  Some people probably do this in Dropbox too. 

With the addition of Evernote and Dropbox integration this will be a really great app.
Version 6.6 2013-04-11 1
Use Google forget about this bad program
I had a great dinner the other night at a restaurant which had bad reviews on trip advisor. Some of the reviews were complaints that they were booked or they tried to get a reservation. This place didn't have any availability or they were closed so they left bad reviews. what a joke. Trip adviser gives a mouth to anybody with an opinion whether it is right or wrong so mostly you get people that just complain that haven't even gone to the restaurant or gone to the museum or gone to any of the things that they experience. Try Yelp or word of mouth way overrated and bad customer service. Phone books might start being useful again.
I'm deleting after the review because it is not useful.
Thanks for all the whiny worthless reviews :-(
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 5
I'm a trip advisor geek, and love using both the site and app to look up the quality of different places. The problem before was that the app and website were not always one in the same. There was no filtering feature for hotel rooms, and no quality selections either. This was changed with the new update, and I absolutely love it! I also love  the picture viewer, as you can first see several pictures at once, instead of trying to scroll through 800 for a picture of the beds. Well done this time Trip Advisor!
Version 6.6 2013-04-09 5
Stable on original iPad. Easy to navigate; intuitive. Top-rated hotels show up on map, but you can find others by searching if they fall further down the list.  I like how you get that screening function so you don't waste time looking for lousy hotels.  Large user base, so you will likely find several reviews for any given choice.  Note:  I have used TA to search for hotels only, not attractions or food. Like the links to travel websites like Orbitz, etc. makes it easier to find rates.

We stayed at the inn this week. The inn was comfortable and very clean. As soon as we walked in, Michael made us feel very welcome. Right away he showed us where we could help ourselves to coffee, tea, delicious pound cake, and wine! He gave us great advise about where to have dinner, and set up our reservation with no hesitation. We were delighted in the morning with breakfast provided by Anthony. Scrumptious! No other words needed. The fritatta, waffle, yogurt with granola and fruit were perfect. Thank you so much for the wonderful hospitatlity!

Before I plan any trip my first visit is to trip advisory to read reviews and ranks as to what they offer, price, rooms, locations, hotels,attractions,  etc.... I been using trip advisory for years and it has never failed me especially when planning islands vacation. My suggestion is to go to where is the most reviews and read all pros and cons. This the most helpful website that I've ever found on the web. Take your time!  I highly recommend this website to anyone who wants to plan a wonderful getaway.
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
I've used trip advisor a few times before traveling to Philippines and Hong Kong.  By doing my research I was able to decide the best hotel for my wife and I.  Also found great tips from other users on best way to get to attractions or if the attraction was worth seeing.  My last trip to Hong Kong was so much better and convenient than when I went the first time which was a nightmare. I wish I had known of this site the first time I went.  So great job to all that participate with their comments, opinions and tips.
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 5
Going somewhere you havent been before? No problem. Give TripAdvisor a few minutes of your time and you'll be an old pro.  You'll know fast the best things to see and do, and best places to eat and to spend the night.  As for written reviews, only pay attention to those folks with at least a few dozen contributions under their belt over the span of months or a few years, else you can get scammed by biased folks trying to game the system.  Also beware those reviews that sound a little too much like a marketing brochure.

First, I'd like to say that I'm a fan of trip advisor, I've used them to plan trips in Europe and in the US. Tonight, I was planning a trip to Vegas on my iPad for the first time. Here's the rub: when you are flipping through the attractions and select your attraction, the map zooms into the location you select (in the background?) but overlays the attraction information over the top of the map so that you can read up on it. When you go back to the list, since the map is reset, the list is reset. So, in a city like Vegas, with over 600 local attractions, you are forced to scroll through the entire list from the beginning. It's so frustrating that it seems trip advisor is forcing you to go to the website instead of using their app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-29 4
I like this app but it doesn't replace the website in terms of functionality currently. Why can't I search for B&Bs or guest houses? I am looking in Patan Nepal and can't search for these. I can only search for Hotels and my results do not include guest houses and B&Bs I can find using the website. If I hadn't checked the website this would lead me to believe I was viewing all the (Trip Advisor rated) options for accommodation when I fact I had not, which is a little deceiving I think. Definitely something to keep in mind when using this app.
Version 5.92 2012-02-16 4
We have four kids in a 12 year age range. We have used this app not only to find places to eat and stay, but also to find a variety of activities to suit everyone. It's always good to have options, and this app helps to more easily find helpful options in unfamiliar places, even while sitting in a MacDonald's parking lot! The ratings so far have been reliable, and I definitely use the info about users to help filter ratings. For instance, I weigh the hotel information from a business traveler a little differently than for a family on vacation. It helps tailor things to our needs.

I travel most weeks for my job. I almost never take the time to research each area before I hop on that week's flight.  But I don't want to miss exploring the best of each town/city while I'm there. This app is perfect for quickly finding the best local spots. You never have to eat at the hotel or spend the evening watching tv. Thanks to tons of reviews you can find where to go in a flash. I'm never disappointed. You can also find wifi spots through a search which is handy.  I rely on it daily.

We would recommend it in an instant and the prices were much more affordable compared to other bed and breakfasts . We would like to visit again ,possibly in the fall. Paola Dunn from Rutherford N.J

I try and rate these places I go to, nobody has rated them yet, so the app won't let me rate them either.  That's pretty dumb.

Other than previous problem, app is pretty good.

Take the ratings with a grain of salt, some people rate everyplace like it is the Ritz.  If the cost is $25US for a room for the night, it isn't five stars and shouldn't be compared to a five star hotel.  Most of the raters have completely unrealistic standards and should be ashamed of themselves for treating small businesses so poorly when all they are trying to do is provide
Decent service at a small fee.  Rate the business based on cost and location.

Trip Advisor has been a must have for us ever since our honeymoon in the summer. We had our entire trip booked except for 2 nights. We started to panic when all hotels we were looking at we're booked. We went to Trip Advisor and found a few available hotels. We checked them out and found a diamond in the rough. We now go to Trip Advisor when we plan trips. Once we are at our destination we check trip advisor for restaurants, places to go ,etc. Like the old commercial says. Don't leave home without it.

The developers did a terrible job with the app. So many little things are wrong - it's basically unusable. 

The biggest thing is the performance is slow. The mobile website is much faster. Not only that, the app doesn't give you a response for actions you've taken. For example, tapping on "more" from a list screen (which should be "back") takes forever to get to the "more" screen, yet the app doesn't give you any indication that your tap actually registered. So I end up tapping "more" multiple times and end up on the home screen, with my search results lost. 

There are a gazillion little things like this. 

The app is so bad that I ended up bookmarking pages from the mobile site (eg, restaurants in London) and adding those to my iphone home screen.

Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
Trip Advisor provides you with so many useful lists for lodging, food, and activities. The reviews are always very recent so it's reflective of what you will find right now. The format of the information allows you to save the items that interest you very easily. It's the best travel advice/discovery app I've found. I really appreciate their including so many activities - lots of sites do hotels and restaurants but not what to do. It's also nice it works on mobile and Web-based access devices.
Version 6.6 2013-03-23 2
I love Trip Advisor and I love being able to use many of the web tools on mobile.  However, in the first 10 minutes of using the app I found two major glitches - 1) when hitting the back button from a hotel page, it doesn't respond for upwards of 10 seconds, and if you hit it more than once before it loads, the app goes back to the home page and you lose your search preferences; 2) when changing check in/out dates, you can't go to another month; when you hit the "next" arrow, it flashes and then goes back to the current month - so don't plan on checking rates or availability unless you're traveling in the next few days.  Very poor design and easily preventable.
Version 8.5 2014-03-05 5
I have grown to seriously appreciate the value of trip advisor. I find the reviews very useful. I think what is particularly important is the trip advisor does not edit or specifically delete reviews. In contrast, yelp will post some and delete others in a very troubling fashion. I know longer contribute to yelp because I think they have a hidden agenda; it might have something to do with purchasing advertising on their site. I'll stick with trip adviser. They are more honest and the reviews more useful.
Version 6.1 2012-05-01 4
I like this app pretty well. Perhaps the best feature on this app that isn't on the website is the fact they can trace where you are and suggest things for the area around you. Perhaps the least helpful thing compared to the website is that you can't automatically translate foreign persons reviews. Many reviews in foreign countries are in foreign languages, and on the computer, with Google translate, you can read them in English. A valuable update to this application would be the ability to easily translate reviews into another language that you can understand.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5
On a recent road trip to Europe, we didn't want to make hotel and dinner reservations in advance because we didn't want to be constrained. I downloaded this Trip Advisor app to my iPad and each time we decided to stop to eat or call it a night, I consulted this app and decided where to eat and sleep based on fellow travelers' recommendations. Not once were we disappointed . It is like having one's own concierge service at your disposal. The separate app for city guides is not as good (relatively few cities and not as accurate).
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-25 4
I really love this app, but although it appears possible to suggest a correction, it is not all that easy to do so.  I had to search on my desktop, no obvious "help" function on the iPad app.  Then, even when one learns how to suggest a correction for an obvious error, it is still not possible to even "suggest" changing the state in a restaurant's address.  What's up with that?  E.G. The Venture Kitchen & Bar is in Virginia, not New Hampshire.  TripAdvisor's error correction mechanism won't even let me "suggest" to change the state.  Rest of the address is correct.  Again, what's up?
Version 6.6 2012-12-16 2
I have been trying to use this app for the last hour, and it works like crap.  It has great potential but is very frustrating to use.  When you try and use the map portion, it resets the list you were sifting through. You click on a place to investigate, then try to go back to the list and it starts over.  Then I have to scroll through ten pages of crap to get back to where I was.  Also the map is not very accurate when compared to google maps. There needs to be a way to search through the local areas by name, without searching the entire world.  Some of the information provided is helpful, if I take it to another app and then look it up. As a stand alone reference tool it is otherwise useless.
Version 6.3 2012-08-01 5
A must stay when visiting the Fernandina Beach area. The Inn and surrounding gardens lend to this relaxing venue. The Innkeeper and family (including Maggie their dog) make you feel instantly welcome. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable. The Veranda is a very appealing location for the evening wine and appetizers. It also served well for the mouth watering and creative breakfast. While there...meet Bob (the Innkeeper) at many of the great local establishments. We have been to many B&B's and this is one of the best.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
First used trip advisor many years ago.  Pretty straight up with good reviews, good monitoring, and many excellent contributors. As you might suspect, the reviews written by us are what people look for.  Now that I have this iPad, well things are even easier to both enter and review. Most of us travel some and go out to eat, movies, attractions, all that stuff. Taking the time to write a quick review might make the difference between someone else having an okay time (or worse) and an excellent time.
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-01 5
A wonderful blend of social and informational details regarding everywhere you will ever want to travel. I literally go no where before checking this app - and reading reviews of hotels, restaurants, and attractions. It has never steered me wrong, and is a wonderful place to collaborate with others while learning new places. I don't write reviews for apps often, but TripAdvisor is a lifeline for me. A flawless app that truly is a MUST have for anyone who travels - for work, or pleasure.
Version 8.2 2014-02-06 4
Love the trip advisor app. Just like the website, it is easy to use and navigate. The forum, however, could be better. If you are sifting through a forum with more than 20 topics, you have to hit the &quot;add 20&quot; at the bottom to see the next 20 topics When you hit the back button after opening a topic, the app takes you back to the beginning so you have to &quot;add 20&quot; until you get back to where you were. This can get annoying, especially when the forum has hundreds if not thousands of topics.
Version 8.1 2013-11-10 5
This is THE main source of travel info I use when planning a trip, whether looking for lodging, restaurants, things to do, nightlife or just tips about a destination I'm not familiar with. Probably my favorite feature of Tripadvisor is how current (fresh) the information is. You choose, a travel guide that was published several years ago or Tripadvisor with reviews posted this vet week! Makes a huge difference. Love this app and I never leave home without it!
Version 5.92 2012-02-08 4
Trip advisor gives u a great rating of the restaurants around u! 
It is the perfect app to visit a new city (both leisure an business). I tasted marvelous meals in amazing restaurant of unknown cities!
The cons: 
- a lot of ppl give great feedback of average/below average places. I always need to review poor feedback comments to understand how the place really is.
- in many city high rating restaurant/hotels are not the best in terms of quality, but in term of quality/prices. This is a con for business travelers with high meals budget

Overall a great app that can't miss on my smartphone
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 5
I use this app every day!  I am either using it to check out restaurants, things to do, hotels or writing a review.  I eat out a lot when traveling and want to be sure I only go to places that have good reviews.  I will try restaurants and things to do that do not have a 5 star rating overall only because not every person's  opinion would be the same as mine.  However, in regards to hotels it must have a 4-5 star rating and must be the most recent.  I highly recommend this app!
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 4
Nice, but...
Since I have an iPod, not the phone, I want to be able to save more information in a smaller, handier space. "My Saves" is a nice feature on TripAdvisor, but instead of saving only individual restaurants, I want to save the whole list of search results all on one page WITH phone numbers. That way, as we're driving through Memphis one night on our way to Texas, we can have one big long list of names and phone numbers and call whoever catches our fancy. Kapiche? The lack of that feature lowers this app from five to four stars.  TripAdvisor always has and remains a great site.
Version 5.93 2012-03-06 5
I like Trip Advisor because I travel....a lot...mostly for work, but plenty for play.  I find that the information is quite dependable. I've used it many, many times for hotels, restaurants and entertainment ideas. 

I like that members can submit reviews...honest, real-life opinions of their experiences.  It's a nice resource for my IPAD, as I am easily lost (geography is not my best friend) and always looking for help.  Gone are the days of needing the gas-station attendant to point you in the "wrong" direction. Enjoy!
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
After discovering trip adviser about two years ago it still boggles my mind on how many people use it.
being the property manager for a small shopping center on Marco island, and being on site daily I constantly hear people talking about how they read the reviews and had to check out the shops. We have one shop (simply cupcakes) that say they're getting about 70% of their business from trip adviser. It amazes me daily. Thank you from our tenants, they wouldn't survive without it.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 5

Version 6.6 2013-04-20 3
Getting use to newer version still like the web site better.  So I'll bump up to three stars
old review below...
Updated version is terrible, let me have the old one back please

We love this app and take it everywhere we travel. It helps us narrow down where we should eat, stay and play,
as sometimes we can't seem to make up our minds.  Everywhere we have chosen off of Trip Advisor has been spot on, and when we travel we want to have great experience and Trip Advisor and fellow travelers make that happen! Thanks and fellow travelers keep up the great writing and sharing!
Still love this app, used it 4 times just today!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-10 5
Riccardo gave us one full day of fantastic views and informed commentary that could not have been duplicated.  He is thoughtful and flexible in every regard. What more can I say but that he is a true gentleman. I would recommend his services without hesitation and would feel our trip to Italy would have been lacking without the depth he added to our experience. Our only regret is we did not have time to book him for more than one day. 
Thank you, Riccardo.
Version 5.8 2011-09-18 5
We were traveling on the road & I fired up the app as we were looking at places to stay in Savannah.  The realtime aspect locater came up showing all restaurants on the Route we were on southbound I77 - I remarked to my husband how cool it was & he said FIND some place soon to stop for lunch.....we hit the jackpot 2 exits later #65 with the FRONT PORCH Country restaurant...the reviews were great & spot on.  Am delighted that we can now find REAL food instead of fast food on our trips. Thanks TRIP ADVISOR!!!!
Version 3.0 2009-03-26 4
Pros: I've found a handful of great hole-in-the wall restaurants that I probably would never have known about. The reviews are helpful. Free!
Version 5.8 2011-10-12 5
My husband and I love adventure, and exploring Arizona.  We plan "adventures" 2-3 times a week now that I only work part time.  Trip Advisor makes it so easy to plan, since I am the "Entertainment Director" in this family.  Next week we are planning a tour of the Az farms that give tours and allow self picking of organics.  And, if we need to quickly change plans unexpectedly, Trip Advisor is right here with me on my iPad2.  We are so glad we have it, so we can spend time playing not in the planning process!
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
Very good for all the reasons noted in reviews, but users should be aware that the app understandably cannot keep up with all recent closures and openings, so info occasionally outdated. Also sometimes misses key spots in local area even though in Trip Advisor database; for example, I recently asked for nearby shopping while standing in parking lot of one of the largest shopping malls in the state (since 2001), and the result showed nearest shopping mall to be 5 miles away. Thus good as a general guide, but cannot assume accuracy or completeness.
Version 5.93 2012-03-28 5
I went on my first big backpacking trip a few weeks back and used trip advisor many times during my vacation either for hotels, activities/ events near where I was and massages!!! I found that with trip advisor I could refine the search to be exactly what I was looking for, and everyone's comments helped me out a lot. Since then I have use trip advisor to log my travels and help others out in the same way they helped me! 

Now I will use tripadvisor for everything travel related!!
Version 8.5 2014-03-29 4
We are recently retired and spend a lot of time traveling. I always turn to Trip Advisor at each new stop to discover attractions and restaurants. TA seems to be getting even better as more people write reviews. My only caveat is when there are just a few reviews and they are screamingly positive, I wonder if the owners family are writing them. Make sure there is a good sample before proceeding. One other tip: when there are mostly positive but also negative reviews, I throw out the 1star reviews but find it useful to read the 3 star ones. Happy travels!
Version 4.1 2010-01-22 2
Annoying problem with the iPod Touch. If you don't have Location Services turned on in Settings Just tells you to go away and try again. If you turn on Location Services you are apt to get an erroneous location if you are on a network hosted by an ISP far away. For example, I'm now in Kailua Kona Hawaii, and it's telling me I'm in San Francisco. At least now I can manually enter a location, but you ought to be able to do this right at the start, whether you have Location Services on or not. Then there is the lack of Hotel info, which I find the most useful part of Tripadvisor. If all you want is restaurant info, there are better apps out there, also free, with many filters, ratings, and a lot easier to use.
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
Great source of information, all in one place. We now rely on TA rather than the usual myriad of assorted apps for locating hotels and restaurants. 

My biggest complaint is I can't find a way to see all my past reviews in one location. The profile appears to be chiseled in stone once you've created it. An additional tab giving you access to your profile and past reviews would be helpful. If such access already exists, it's buried where I couldn't find it.
Version 6.6 2013-03-01 3
I've written many reviews FOR TripAdvisor, so I guess it's time to write one ABOUT TripAdvisor.  TA is useful, if one realizes that anyone can post a review without any confirmation that he has actually used the service being reviewed. So it's very vulnerable to false reviews, both good and bad. But I still use it -- always trying to guess which reviews are real vs. false. 

But the TA app has gone noticeably downhill. The main feature I notice is that only one location can be displayed on a map. Previously, multiple restaurants or hotels could be viewed, so that a choice could be made based on proximity, in addition to TA rating.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 5
I had never used tripadvisor before or even heard much about it. When I was researching my latest getaway I really just stumbled upon it. It is the best app I have ever used. I used it everyday on vacation for things to do & restaurants and directions. I would have been lost without it. The reviews were super helpful in picking out a restaurant to eat at and giving little helpful tips for things to do. I am going to San Diego next month & this will most definitely come in handy.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 1
For starters you're forced to use landscape mode.  Pictures take forever to load with no notice that they ever might.  The arrow buttons don't work.  I'm on picture 10/43.  I click right and now I'm on 4/43.  The search box...brings up my results...I move to click on one but as the map section (finally) finishes loading the search results refresh for some reason and the result I wanted is gone, "no results found". POS.  Those are just small examples of the overall poor effort in this app.  I wouldn't normally waste my time writing a review but I've already wasted so much time hoping this app would eventually impress me, I am compelled to save others the time.

Just go to the website and click through the annoying ad for this (c)app.
Version 6.6 2013-02-22 5
Whether u travel once a year or once a week trip advisor app is a must have.  Anywhere I travel I use trip advisor.  It has really enhanced my stays.  Recently in St. Louis it helped me find everything from the Budweiser tour to a good sushi restaurant just a walk from my hotel.  It is even great for local places where you live.  If you have a great time at a local place let people know by placing a review so travelers to your town can experience the best it has to offer.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-26 5
Trip Advisor is a great site to find out of the way places and even ask nonbiased people what they think of a hotel or resort.  if you are traveling to a place it is a great resource to find a place to stay or to eat.  I have found many hole in the walls and also stayed away from some overrated places.

The City Guides are incredible!!  I lived in Boston a year and have been back more than 10 times, but i downloaded the City Guide and it was so helpful with numbers, directions, reviews, etc.
Version 6.6 2012-11-25 4
The new version's search is fairly useless. I put in a restaurant or a specific place to visit and it says it cannot find it. I go the city and scroll down through 100 restaurants and there is the one I was looking for. Or, worse, it fills put the search box for me indicating it knows exactly what I want and then sends me to a list of restaurants unrelated to my original search. Tried it in another ipad with same results. i hope they fix it soon. Trip advisor is truly the best traveling tool, but this app is very annoying to use.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-27 4
I find it an useful tool.  It is helpful to read multiple opinions, one can generally wade through the static and determine what fits.  It has a vast amount of data, but be careful and glean from other sources to get information. Remember it is a tool to help plan and execute your own trip, use many data points and don't look for perfect wisdom.  Some people's jewels are NOT others treasures .  Of I had to put a <  > value, I would say about 70% accurate, including my own ratings, I am very picky, some people just want to be out of the rain.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 5
I love this app! It allows me to share my experiences, and it's therapeutic to be able to vent about places that are less than perfect (sugarcoated). Also I can gush about wonderful places I've visited, and share my experiences with others! I like that some establishments take the time to respond to negative reviews. I love this app. It also helps me when I'm traveling to a place I've never been...so I can see what other people are saying so I can make a better decision on where to stay! Love it! :)
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
I use TripAdvisor several times per week to check out hotels, restaurants, and things to do when I travel for both business and pleasure, and even for local restaurants and activities. I have NEVER been misled and, more often than not, the recommendations exceeded my expectations. I've even been to a few places and participated in activities that I would not have ever considered doing until I read reviews. I'm a huge fan and recommend it frequently to family, friends, and colleagues.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 4
Whether I am taking a Saturday afternoon "cruise" on Texas back roads, or headed cross country, when its time to put the top down and hit the road, TripAdvisor is my companion.  When taking summer time cruises, I enjoy staying at motor court motels. TripAdvisor has been reliable for helping me find clean, friendly establishments. I find most reviews are on target. Because I travel without reservations (I never know where I want to stop until the day progresses) it is nice to have a reliable source to use while on the road.
Version 8.0 2013-10-09 5
I used this app religiously around Europe. It offers accurate maps with live tracking, detailed information for activities, restaurants and hotels. Reviews can be found for most things on the app, although I have found that some people leave misleading reviews on certain places (almost always bad for no good reason). Probably the only downside with this app is that you mays find yourself not freely exploring places as much.
Version 8.5 2014-03-05 5
My husband and I were on our way home after he had just had eye surgery. We were tired and hungry and happened to see Miguel's. We were surprised to see the parking lot almost full and on a Monday night! We thought this was a good sign to give it a try. We were so pleased that we did. It was so impressive how the staff supported one another. The food was delicious and prepared with pride. We will certainly return soon and be sure to tell our friends. Thank you Sean
Version 8.5 2014-03-01 5
Really concur about the usefulness of this app worldwide, especially as the primary source for choosing a hotel or restaurant. TA generally offers enough ratings, including for off-the-beaten track locations, that one can rely on the median after checking both extremes. It also a perfect supplement to Michelin, Lonely Planet , Fodor, etc. in that its numerous & generally sophisticated reviews run the gamut from up-to-the-minute to a few years earlier.
Version 8.3 2013-12-31 5
Although it's rightfully named TripAdvisor, this app is invaluable when it comes to planning the best consumer experience in ANY location; even in your local neighborhood. The compilation of reviews, ratings and photos serve to give a great understanding of what you can look forward to. Whether it's dining-out, going to the movies or just staying at a hotel; TripAdvisor can help plan your next consumer experience.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-10 2
The information is great, many useful reviews of restaurants in Europe especially. The app however is poor. 

Firstly it is not a real app but web pages made to look like an app. On cell data connections the responsiveness of the app is terrible as a result, pages take very long to download and it is a long and tedious process navigating the various filters. 

Many times filters have to be redone over and over when wanting to change the search a little, which becomes a big problem given the speed of the app on slow connections. 

Native apps such as maps, yelp, and others provide a much superior experience when it comes to speed and  smoothness.
Version 5.92 2012-02-27 5
I have used this for planning US and European travel and find it very helpful and well designed.  Two improvements I would request:  if there is any way to request info along a travel corridor, for instance along a highway between X and Y, it would be a boon for en-route road trips.  Secondly, if reviewers could characterize themselves (practical, adventure, high-maintenance, luxury only, etc) it would help in culling reviewers' comments.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-21 5
This app has been extremely helpful in finding and booking restaurants when I travel.  Every restaurant I've tried that has been highly rated by reviewers on TripAdvisor has been true to the ratings. The app is especially helpful when traveling with kids, as it saves us from walking around aimlessly searching for a place to eat not knowing what we'll get. Knowledge is power and TripAdvisor definitely delivers the knowledge!
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
I've heard about trip advisor but didn't start using it until planning for a big trip abroad. The information is abundant, full of details and recommendations. Love that here is iPhone and iPad apps as well as a robust PC experience. Love this site and recommend to everyone to use while booking a trip. It's helped me make the best choices and provided me with key details that I wouldn't have considered otherwise. Thank you trip advisor!
Version 6.6 2012-11-25 4
This is a great app, but as I find myself researching a trip to Ireland next year, I realize the app could use additional features.  One such feature is the ability to bookmark forum topics or conversations.  I find it difficult to locate things I have read.  Also the price range shown under hotels and B&Bs (for everywhere, not just Ireland) is usually incorrect (on the very low side).  Other than that I have spent many hours with this app doing research of places I would otherwise have never heard of!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-04 5
TripAdvisor is one of the most useful apps out there, and we use it regularly when we plan for travel, when we arrive at the destination and even at home to "discover" new stuff about the region where we live.  It has been a lifesaver when friends or family come to visit and want to have the "local tour". We find the advice pretty accurate, and many of the anecdotes are entertainment in themselves.  Thank you for providing such a great service!
Version 6.6 2013-04-11 5
When searching my IPad for a hotel to rate this past weekend I could not find it. Felt so strong about how great and dog friendly the hotel was I wrote a note to Trip Advisor.  Timely and friendly response from staff.  Went to phone app and sure enough its there. Oh that great hotel with an outstanding staff which is extremely DOG friendly is Country Inn & Suites by Carlson, right off I-95 in Port Orange, Fl. Great stop for folks heading to South Fl or the Keys. Also within minutes of Daytona Beach.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 2
I absolutely loved the version before this latest, and would have given it 5 stars. But this new layout is awkward and annoying to maneuver. I hate the filters menu on the right, it covers 3/4 of the map! And you can hide it...but why not set the default to it being hidden and if we want it, then we click on it?! I look for a hotel based on the map, so that's what I want to see. It's just a poor layout compared to the last version and there are more steps just to get to the price of the hotel...and back to the list. And i dislike that the list is always up on the left side, liked it better when I could view info and prices of a hotel across the whole screen. Please change back!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
I've been using Trip Advisor for a few years now and have been on several trips with my printed itinerary with things I discovered researching here.   I got a smart phone last November and was thrilled to see that there was an app for it.  At first I wasn't able to see 'saved' items in both locations but I can now.  And now on my iPad... I'm always planing trips now no matter what device I am on I can see it all... Hotels, sites to see, restaurants, reviews.. Love it, happy traveling!!!
Version 8.3 2013-12-31 5
Look deep at this app, you would really find that TripAdvisor has done a great job on maintaining their app just amazing like the website. Read the positive reviews and you might find what your are looking for, that doesn't mean I ignore the non positive one. But I'm sure all the positive reviews were written for a perfect reason. Thank you TripAdvisor you are what I'm looking for to put my heart and mind in ease where ever I travel and I go.
Version 8.5 2014-02-24 5
This site is off the hook all I see for this company is a great future and great growth it's an amazing site amazing fast speed only one suggestion I have for them is that on the first page when you enter things to so in a specific country something should come up it will be easy for user suppose on the first page when you put you things to do in New Delhi India things should pop up other than that I give them thumps up 5 star
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-17 5
You wouldn't leave home without your wallet, purse or phone, right? No way you can travel without TripAd! Whether it's the app or via online, I always check a place out on TripAd first. Sure some of the reviews are to be taken with a grain of salt, but more times than not, it's point on. I depend on TripAd just like I depend on my GPS to get me to my destination. I would never stay at a hotel or take a vacation without first reviewing it on TripAdvisor first.
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 5
Need a hotel?  This is where to research and find the best accommodation for any trip.  I looked for weeks forma large quad room in Rome for June 2011.  I looked for nearly 2 months on all sorts of websites but overall selected the one I am staying at this week through here and I could not be more pleased.  Price and location were important but the reviews of guests is what makes the website so powerful.  Thank you All for always letting other travelers know your experiences.

I found Tripadvisor in 2010 after using several different booking sites to compare hotels. I wished I had found it earlier because it made planning our last two hotels in Europe much easier. I found the reviews to be very insightful and correct, and it's easier for me to trust an independent site. I've nearly only used Tripadvisor to plan our 2012 trip to Europe and am looking forward to sharing our experiences for the benefit of future fellow travelers!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
Any trip I plan, I check Trip Advisor first when booking lodging. I have been using this website for many, many years and it has never steered me wrong. Checking the reviews and member photos of properties that Im considering always helps me make the right decision as to where I will stay. Thank you so much for the handy app. I now use this all the time and have saved many travel disappointments by using it!!!
Version 5.9 2011-11-18 3
I wish there was an option to select the level of traveler. There are lots of great options but some of them are low-class and not what the experienced, high-budget traveler is looking for. For example, while in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I relied exclusively on TripAdvisor to help me plan my trip. There were some great attractions, but an art museum right down the street from where we were staying was not on the list of "Top 10" and I later found out there were some very renowned works and artists in the museum! I was very disappointed. When TripAdvisor caters more to the individual user's needs, I will be more of a fan.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 5
My boyfriend and I used trip advisor to help us plan our trip to Belize.  With Trip Advisor you can view other people's reviews about where to stay and photos from their trips. We managed to plan our fantastic trip to Belize by reading reviews and I'm so glad this app is available to anyone.  It's easy to use, and I have already posted 2 reviews at the two resorts we stayed at.  Hopefully other people will find my reviews to be helpful as I did with theirs.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-13 5
I've been using Trip Advisor for years now, and find it to be a wonderful site with dependable and trustworthy reviews. The app just makes it easier to use on the road with just a phone connection (the full website has lots of pictures), and has gotten a workout on the road this year. Better then Yelp for traveling, since Yelp has a real issue with fake and untrustworthy reviews, and easier to use than other sites, what's not to love?
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-14 1
Horribly written app from pretty much every perspective imaginable.  Slow, buggy, and badly designed user experience. Most basic of user operations only lead to frustration. For example, on the iphone version if you've requested a list of nearby restaurants and then selected a restaurant from the list, when you return to the result list it will have changed to be every restaurant sorted by popularity, forcing you to completely start over from the home screen to get you original distance sorted results back. This is probably the most common operation in the app, so for it not work shows how little thought went into the design and implementation of this app. It's a shame because Tripadvisor has lots of good data.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
I have my fair share of travel apps including yelp and opentable, but the ranking feature on Tripadvisor lets me quickly find out what fellow travelers thinks is the best.  It is easy to use and navigate.  I love the save feature so I can quickly bookmark ideas that what I want to revisit.  I wish the reviews would somehow integrate with yelp reviews at least on food.  Overall, highly recommend to anyone who likes to travel.
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 5
I use Trip Advisor every time I look for a condo or hotel.  The reviews help me weed out the bad ones and narrow my focus.  Recently my travel
company,  Jan-Dar travel Services in Sarasota, Florida( aka Tradewinds) tried to book us into a hotel.  I read the reviews and found the hotel was rated very poorly and even had bedbugs!  Trip Advisor saved is from a miserable vacation!
 
I am starting to use it more for restaurants.  The reviews are really helpful.
Thank you Trip Advisor.
Version 2.0 2008-07-31 1
What a disappointment. I am a big fan of the regular web version of Tripadvisor, and find the reviews of hotels, etc... to be very helpful. i was very glad to find this app - even if it only deals with restaurants for now. Imagine my surprise when i see that the app is just a front-end to open the same web page as you woud se on a PC - even with all the crappy pop-ups you get there. Trying to close those pop-ups on a small screen like the iPhone is quite the chore. I would have expected that the app would have pulled data from TripAdvisor content and displayed it in a readable way for the device. Nope. They took the lazy way out. I certainly hope that they change this to display data in the native iPhone app - not some pseudo web browser. Avoid this app until they do.
Version 5.92 2012-01-19 5
I totally depend on this app when ever I travel or search for a restaurant anywhere. It's extremely dependable as the reviews are from real people like me. One thing is that you have to read many reviews before making a decision as everyone has different likes and dislikes. Important to remember.   

I especially like the fact that reviews are detailed and not generic. People give details about the food, service, actual room numbers, travel to and from etc. 

All in all, LOVE IT.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 2
So...here we are. It is magnificent outside today in quaint Summerville ( a woodsy outskirts town outside of FABULOUS Charleston...ask me how we really feel). So, we enjoyed only FireFly sweet tea vodka & lemonade, and Lizzy (Chardonnay-of course).  We headed out to the "back garden" which is really a former parking lot (according to Michael). Well, the Chardonnay was Woodbridge? (But it's NOT a wine bar) and Michael's tea was yummy (and tried to be authentic Southern). Have to say that I have had brunch here... Eggs Benedict "Benny", and Michael says the burgers, fish 'n chips, and cheesesteak are delicious. He also mentioned "bloody mary bar on Sundays" WOW!  Ps...btw a giant Jenga, ping-pong, stage for a band...fun!
Version 8.2 2013-12-03 5
This app is up to date, easy to navigate, and has accurate prices.  I like the "favorites" feature so you can research hotel or restaurants prior to your trip.  Whenever I travel I rely on the user reviews and expertise of TripAdvisor's ratings to assist me in finding the best places.  This makes the trip more enjoyable when I arrive since I will know where to eat first!  Make sure you sync your account across all your devices/computers.
Version 8.5 2014-03-18 2
.... This site can claim to be unbiased .  Yes it does allow guest to be a helping hand on status of properties.  But yet some reviews are not getting out up on sites even when they are 5 star.  Also the categories for food places in some city's don't make sense.  They should have a better break down. Example how can a chocolate lounge be rated #4 restaurant when there is really no savory food served there.  Or a hotel that hasn't had a review in over two months still be #1 when the #2 spot has been consistently getting reviews.  Doesn't make sense.   I just think the site has some minor flaws that can be fixed to make it definitely the best.
Version 6.6 2012-10-20 3
I've been using this app to plan travel, and when it doesn't crash on me, it is helpful. It has its instability issues, though, and times when I give it one set of search parameters and it gives me results that aren't what I asked for (like I searched for flights for 1 person flying economy to Las Vegas, it gave me back 2 people flying economy or first class, and when I tried to "change search", it crashed). I see great potential for usefulness with this app once these bugs are ironed out, hence why I am still using the app instead of trashing it after so many crashes.
Version 8.3 2014-01-03 5
Excellent location in the Inner harbor, almost in front of the Maryland Science center 2 blocks from Orioles stadium and Aquarium. City and hotel are family friendly. Plus the hotel have a great tennis and basketball court plus and a Small Pool which picture are not included in Travelocity. But the best is the staff's courtesy , and the most valuable concierge  ever Mr. Jonathan B Knox, thank you so much for your hospitality, caring and professionalism.
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 3
Working one's way through the jumble of data Trip Advisor has stored can be a challenge. Restaurant reviews for example often include no information at all about what the reviewer actually ate.  Maybe the privilege of ranting or raving in the narrative review should only be earned by providing some real information about the place being reviewed. It is also annoying that when one discovers a great restaurant that is not in the TA database, there is no way to review it or even submit it for inclusion.  The app still needs a lot of development to be a truly useful crowd sourcing tool.
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 5
Example: went to Seoul, told a friend (native of Seoul) that I planned to dine at the #1 ranked restaurant...he had not heard of it and was very skeptical.  Later, we stopped by the restaurant to find the longest line to get in restaurant we had ever seen.  The line went down the street and around the block....amazing! I have the video on my phone to show people who are just learning about Trip Advisor.  I appreciate the reviews from people and try to contribute whenever I can.
Version 6.1 2012-05-06 5
This was my fifth Backroads biking trip. Once again I was not disappointed with Backroads. Everything was taken care of from  beginning to end. The cycling was not that challenging but it was perfect for me as I hadn't trained very much. We meandered through quiet French villages, visited amazing chateaus and marveled at the fields of yellow rapeseed flowers. Let's not forget our wonderful leaders that were there every step of the way. Always smiling and lending a hand!
Version 6.4 2012-08-22 3
This is a generally good app however, there is no option for me to only sort through pet friendly hotels. I have to travel with my dog and I'm tired of trying to sort through every single hotel and click on amenities section on each hotel profile to find out if pets are allowed or not. It's annoying and takes forever if trying to search on my phone. The website allows you to filter pet only hotels etc. but not the iPhone app... When this happens I end up using other apps and you loose a customer.... Please add important feature for my options... Thank you
Version 6.6 2013-01-07 4
I was skeptical when I read some reviews. However, let me first say that our waiter was very kind and "welcomingly zen". Although one of our plates did not come with the others, they immediately provided a "temporary" one until we got what we had ordered. The side dishes were all  delicious and our individual meals were fantastic. The whole ambiance & food combination was a delectable experience. I am glad we chose this restaurant in our overnight stay in Denver!!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
This app provides the most accurate reviews.  It is easy to plan days or just travel and tour sporadically with this app set to "Things to do near me now". 
The hotels have been just what I expected after reading the reviews.  I like the true to life pictures posted by the travelers. They tell the unvarnished truth about the hotel and the rooms in a way you cannot get from a brochure from the hotel itself.  Five stars for the real stories!
Version 5.5 2011-06-28 5
I travel a lot throughout the US and International. I always check out hotels and local restaurants before I go. Last week my wife and I tried out a seafood oyster bar in Panama City that was recommended by trip advisor. We liked it so much we returned a few days later with three other couples. 
Trip advisor gives you the opportunity to compare and make your choices, weather your looking for fancy high priced or a low priced local hangout and every thing in between.
Version 5.8 2011-09-28 5
This app is amazing! It's authentic & honest & was an incredible help during my trip in Ireland. I used it to locate 3 different hotels and B&Bs on the spot and was never disappointed. I love that it lists the average prices of rooms (also accurate) as well as the hotel's standing in the area (e.g. #4 out of 130 hotels) and gives you easy access to pics and reviews. I highly recommend this app to anyone, particularly when traveling overseas.
Version 6.2 2012-06-29 5
Once I started using TripAdvisor, I got rid of all of the other "where is it" apps and use this exclusively. It launches much more quickly than the other apps I had been using, and seems to have a much broader user base, so I find the reviews more useful. We found a wonderful little out-of-the-way motel in Vero Beach we wouldn't have found otherwise. But I find it equally useful for locating local restaurants, attractions, etc.
Version 6.2 2012-06-21 1
Saving something doesn't store it for offline use!!!!!!  So.  Frustrating.  

Useless in Nassau, Bahamas.  Keeps commending things in other Nassaus.  "Near me now" should set location to the region I am in while I navigate around the app, so I stop getting results from places where I'm not when I do searches.  UI is prettier than I'd expect, but half baked from a usability point of view.

Recommendations here are VERY limited and stale.  Really surprised and let down.  Would have researched better before I left, had I known.

Inability to save for offline use makes the app irrelevant on an actual trip.  Better to research across multiple sites and then use a note taking app like Evernote, or...  a piece of old fashioned paper.
Version 6.6 2013-03-04 4
Being a single grandmother and full-time solo RVer, apps like TripAdvisor are important in helping me make a wise decision. Many places look at older, single women in a somewhat negative way.
When I go to a restaurant or hotel, I watch how everyone is treated. When the service is good, I generally seek out a manager and tell him or her. It's important and helpful to everyone. 
Trip Advisor allows me the opportunity to pass that information along.
Since I first downloaded the TA app a year ago, I have only written one unsatisfactory review.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 3
Really frustrating to be looking for stuff near where I am and get search results for St. Louis whilst I am in Memphis, TN. Not exactly my definition of near. The other complaint is adding new places is not intuitive or easy to do from within the app.  I don't do it often and I've just basically quit adding new places since after 20 minutes of hunting, I couldn't find it....  
That said, the content is great, even if the app is mediocre.  Have identified great cheap hotel in Beijing and introduced people to new restaurants in their hometown based on recommendations from Trip Advisor reviews.
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
As a delta airlines staff in Santiago I must say that have been in many different places in the world. Meet many people who has helped me, guide me to some nice places, etc. If I would I have known before of this app I would have saved more money, been in more places and avoid going to see friends just to not pay for accommodations. :D excellent tool for someone who travels a lot and want to evaluate the place, the room, and the quality for a future journey.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I really like this app because I am forced to book thru a third party travel agency. This travel agency books whatever we want but doesn't always have the latest up to date info I need.  With trip advisor I just plug in where I want to go, what hotel I want, and which rental car agency I want to use. 

Although I've only used it a few times, it has def helped me out. Especially when I needed to find a flight home.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 4
I almost always check on TripA what others said about a destination, a hotel or restaurant or sight, before I make my travel plan. There are two types of outliers, which I make sure to ignore: the reviews of those who were upset/angry/disappointed about something that has little to do with the quality of the destination and those who write unjustifiably glowing praise mainly because they loved the waitress or the bellboy! I wish there were filters to discard those types of reviews.
Version 6.6 2013-02-23 5
My family and I are at this large resort where the restaurants are just so-so. (El  Conquistador in Puerto Rico) The location based restaurant finder was just what we needed. We were able to find a great restaurant close by while not knowing the area at all, and didn't have to worry about insincere recommendations from cab drivers, etc.  who may be getting kickbacks. Get it, then write your own reviews to help people like me out!
Version 6.6 2013-03-05 5
I really like this app because it doesn't pick which places you want to go for you. I don't know specifically if you have to pay to be featured on yelp but when I type in "restaurants" only select ones show up. Here everything you can possibly imagine pops up in your search area. I travel a lot and hate chain places so I utilize this app as a resource to find places in my area if I'm not familiar with the location. It has yet to disappoint.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-13 5
This app is the best when you are traveling. If you travel anywhere this app will tell you attractions, places to eat, and hotels.  My family was traveling across three states. I was able to pick cities between here and there to see what was available. I could also rate what kind of restaurant I wanted and cost. Also this app hooks up with your maps and can give you directions and phone numbers to places.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
This app is almost everything I wanted in a vacation planner.  You enter a location, and Trip Advisor brings up all the Things to Do, Restaurants, and Hotels.  I found activities that I would have never found elsewhere, and would have missed out on.  I go through all the things to do, save my favorites, and my family and I whittle it down.  It would be nice if you could add your own notes, have a vacation budget planner, and print itineraries.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-06 2
Tripadvisor is an awesome service and I use it frequently when I travel to find places to stay and visit. However the mobile app is designed as a web page, but worse because if you loose your Internet connection (for example because you were using the WiFi of a coffee shop) there is no way to go back and see the places that you looked at moments before. Therefore I end up creating screenshots in order to remember the names and addresses of the restaurants I want to visit, and that in no way is a good solution. I wish Tripadvisor would add the option to add a place to favorites list and cache it for offline viewing.
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
Excellent design, simple and efficient you can be searching away very quickly and look for different options as well, would be nice to be able to narrow down your flight searches by airline before inputting the dates and going to the search window to see which fates your preferred airline operates on.

Other than date a must have for anyone looking to travel. I also found that trip advisor recommendations are on the spot.
Version 5.7 2011-06-25 5
My wife and I love to use TripAdvisor when planning our vacations. Getting the user reviews for locations, hotels, etc. Is tremendously useful. We have even posted a couple of times for really good (and one really bad) locations. This app makes it quick and easy to access the info we rely on.  Nothing fancy, which is good.  Just a simple interface that gets you what you need without a ton of stuff you don't. If you use TripAdvisor, this is app is a must.
Version 5.8 2011-09-29 5
So often, "optimized for the web" = reduced functionality. Not so with TripAdvisor. It actually works better on my iPhone than the regular site and gives me everything I need to plan my trips in advance as well as on the fly when I'm at my destination. The Save feature is terrific, and you can view Eats, Things to Do, or Sleeps either by user rating or distance from a selected spot (say, your hotel). Just download it--you'll be glad.
Version 5.9 2011-11-22 5
We just returned from a fantastic trip through Bhutan. Our guide, Karma, works for different companies, but also has a company of his own, Bhutan Herders. 
Karma has a great knowledge of the history of Bhutan. His is highly educated and his English superb. He is flexible, easy to get along with and created great hikes for us throughout Bhutan. Next time we visit we will do a trek with Karma, which is his specialty. Can't recommend him enough.

The iPad version of Trip Advisor is a better user experience than the online version.  Quick and easy access to whatever you are searching for is at your finger tips.  Gone are the pop ups from your browser and connectivity headaches when using a laptop on a wireless network.  

The ability to find a restaurant, things to do, and other points of interest combined with a quick conversion to a map and directions means that Trip Advisor iPad version is a "lIke it, love it, gotta have it" app!
Version 5.4 2011-02-17 5
Great travel app. It's been my crutch throughout honeymoon planning! I totally recommend trying/using it for your next trip!

Suggestion: If there was a "favorites" or "save info" option, it would be even more perfect!
Version 6.0 2012-03-25 4
Trip Advisor is my first stop once I pick my destination. You get real experiences from real people and can make your decisions based on this. Occasionally you experience a really bad review, but just like everything, toss out the best and worst and consider the rest. I have never been disappointed when I've made my decisions of where to stay or what to do based on Trip Advisor. It's like having a friend go check out the city and giving you their recommendations. I always trust this site.
Version 6.6 2012-10-29 5
This is a terrific resource for anyone traveling to another state or even another town you are not familiar with! You can find any type of lodging, restaurant or attraction for the area you are traveling to. The ratings are done by the consumers who visit these places, so they are real reviews you can rely on to be actual experiences. And there are suggestions for you as well. Top notch site for travel! Love it!

I was a huge believer in the app and as a frequent traveler, I used and contributed to it continuously.  They made significant changes to the app for Os7 and really made it difficult to use.  You used to be able to scroll around the map view to find locations. After the changes, you must know the exactly name of the town or it doesn't show the location.  This is a real problem when you re traveling and don't know the name of suburbs.  I hope they fix it soon. I have reported it and got a response but that was several weeks ago.  Bummer.
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 5
This app is very useful. I make sure to check Trip Advisor whenever we go on vacation. It has mostly all the things you need to know to make your trip worthwhile. And during long driving, it really helps that you have this app on your smartphone. You never know when you need to stop (hotel for a quick stay, food, gas, ATM, etc) and having this app makes it all so easy to find what you're looking for. Thank you for making this app!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 5
Unlike Yelp, Trip Advisor will not pull reviews in an effort to make more $ by selling them back to the business owner. It's inconceivable that such a practice is legal.  Back to Trip Advisor.  I can always count on finding good, honest recommendations for restaurants, hotels and fun activities.  And people like me who love to travel have the best perspective on such things; you can find us here!  I wouldn't use anything else!
Version 6.2 2012-07-02 5
This app is very intuitive and informative. The way it's laid out makes it really easy to find what you are interested in. The only comments I have are that the places brought up on the trip advisor website aren't necessarily the same as those on the app. Also, I couldn't figure out how to send a website linked to from the app to a friend, because the web address wasn't displayed. Maybe that's just me missing something though.
Version 6.4 2012-08-20 5
Seriously useful and handy for travelers, whether yr on a planned trip or a journey thru the unknown, Tripadvisor is yr friend. Show up anywhere and within a few seconds, you'll know where you are and what to do. I wish they includes hostels in their listings, but what it does have can't be beat. Curious about other places? Just go there and ask questions later. If you have tripadvisor with you, the answers are but a few taps away.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-14 5
I love discovering new places in cities I love and tripadvisor helps me do just that. The city guide for NYC has opened up so many aspects of this amazing city and I am grateful to all those who have put this highly informative and practical content together. 

Whenever I feel like rolling the dice and follow the advice of those who have been there before this handy app is right there. I don't leave home without it
Version 5.7 2011-08-05 4
I am using it on an iPad while on vacation in Colorado Springs. The wifi access is variable so it cannot always determine my location automatically. Every time I open this app I have to type in Colorado Springs over and over again. If it would just pop up the last location searched (like the Weather Channel app) it would be less aggravating. I am now Apple-lazy and want this thing to do the work for me.  If only we chose a short location like Miami or Boise ...
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 3
The new version of the TA app is a little slicker-looking, but not really that different once you get to the various sections. I like the fact that it starts up on the menu screen instead of the Google Map for your current location, especially when I'm trip planning at home. (I don't really need to immediately know about the restaurant around the corner that's been there for 25 years...)

Biggest irritation so far is that hyperlinks in forum messages no longer work, and since the actual URL is often abbreviated, the only way to follow the link is go to the TA website in Safari.
Version 5.9 2012-01-11 4

This app did great work in lisbon, Portugal and now at Martha's vineyard, USA. 
Do turn the filter for only mappable places off if you aren't seeing much and know things like fishing charters are missing.
You can also use this app to leave reviews to help out other travelers easily.  I know I tend to forget if I wait until I get home unless it was amazing or disastrous.  You can also save things to look at later.  Love it!!!
Version 5.4 2011-09-10 4
I used Trip Advisor in conjunction with other similar apps on a recent road trip vacation to the Florida Keys to find places to stay, eat, and hire other travel related services, and it was very helpful. I am going to suggest some enhancements to the app itself, and you do have to remember that not all reviews or reviewers are 100% reliable (or may be outdated, at least), but absolutely get this app! And then please, contribute accurate reviews! The main strength of this app is the depth and breadth of the review database!
Version 5.9 2011-12-12 5
The TripAdvisor app for the iPad is well-written, especially how well it integrates text and mapping. Explore an new vacation destination using the maps and read the reviews for the more interesting places to eat, stay and visit. I've gotten into the habit of using Facebook to check-in to places where we eat, then writing reviews of the best ... and hopefully not the worst! Allow several days for your reviews and your pictures to be vetted and posted.
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
I absolutely love this app.  If you like to travel like I do this app is all you need to plan your vacations.  With just a touch of a button you have access to all the attractions, hotels, and restaurants in your area.  With photos, and reviews it helps you to find all the hotspots you are looking for. I would be loss without this app.  So many times I've gone on vacation and googled things to do, and never had a large selection like I do now.
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5
I rely first and foremost on Trip Advisor for hotel and restaurant reviews.  My husband and I love to travel in the tropics.  We live in the Virgin Islands and know how spotty reviews can be in tropical settings, so we read Trip Advisor extensively as well as a guide book or 2 (usually Lonely Planet and Frommer's). Trip advisor is accurate, you get the good, bad and the ugly.  Sort out yourself which are rose colored glasses types versus nothing can please them types.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
We really just started using this site this year and I have to say now I don't really want to go anywhere with out checking out trip advisor first!! So far all of the reviews have been spot on.  Once in a while there will be one or two that have a bad experience some where but I usually check to see that the majority of the reviews say similar positive things. Then I know that it will be a good choice!
Version 5.6 2011-07-01 4
This AP is what I expected from Tripadvisor. I have used their website for years and the AP is almost as user friendly as the site. Unlike the website, on the AP you must go back several steps to get to a different hotel or venue. I will still use it though! My husband and I were able to quickly access hotel information. We were on a impromptu trip and had no plans. The Tripadvisor AP allowed us to find a nice places for good prices as we traveled down back roads and major roads. Thanks!
Version 6.6 2013-01-08 5
Excellent tool for planning a trip, the reviews people post are always very high quality and helpful. 

My nay complaint is the maps, they're sometimes hard to use (if you move it a bit ti see whats around, it will automatically change the results to new search results in that area...). They're also not very detailed, street names etc. But nonetheless very good and useful, thanks for the great, free app TipAdviser!
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 5
I was TripAdvisor-obsessed before my 2012 trip to Ireland. It was my secret weapon for a great trip! Reviews and travel forums cover EVERYTHING you'd want to know before you make an important decision. I found it amazing how SOMEONE had always asked the same (or similar) question and could help me out. So I'm determined to pay it back with reviews whenever I can ... And a thorough review of MY Ireland trip. Thanks, TripAdvisor!

I use app while traveling and find it very useful:
1. For selecting a good hotel, alternative accommodations, or  rentals. 2. to learn about key attractions in cities, parks and monument areas. 3. Restaurant rating and review are reliable. 
Great to use app in combo with Yelp for selection fine tuning too in USA. 
Find very useful internationally when yelp isn't available. Also use the trip adviser city app.

Tripadvisor is an absolute necessity!!  I travel all of the time and wouldn't leave home without it.  This is how I find delicious restaurants.  Likewise it's how I let other travelers know about great places I've tried.  If I encounter something unacceptable, then I can warn people about it as well.  I have the app loaded on my iPad and iPhone.  Sometimes there are quirks and it doesn't work perfectly, but for the most part it's great.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 4
This is a great app. It is very intuitive and user friendly, with pleasing layout and colors. It is easy to find what you are looking for, whether using normal search or near-me search. 
It then displays relevant info and reviews. No clutter or unnecessary info.  From a content point of view it seems to cover most establishments no matter how remote, with enough reviews to get a balanced view.   A definite must-have app, whether you are traveling and looking for a restaurant or hotel or planning your next trip.
Version 6.4 2012-09-08 5
Trip Advisor is a great tool & I always use it, especially when I'm going somewhere out of the way. I've found some real deals in unexpected places where hotels are few or when I am looking for a decent, inexpensive to moderate and maybe hidden gem. The comments are more worthwhile than the star system, as I've found lower rated places that fit the bill for me (if not for the rater).
Version 5.6 2011-05-23 5
I would say that I was really happy to see the interface of this app. I travel a lot and most of the time find myself searching for hotels or restaurants on my tiny blackberry screen..,
But this is exactly what I need on y iPad. Something that knows where I am and suggests according to my filters... This really changed the way I look for things around.. Off to a nice restaurant to eat something (which is actually few blocks away) !! Cheers
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 3
I love trip advisor & until today I absolutely loved the app. I used to be able to click on any category of reviews for a hotel without having to read all 300 of them. It is an app - Good, bad & ugly should be easily accessible independently for a snapshot of pros & cons. They have made recent changes to the app which make it impossible to read a category of reviews. No longer quick & easy to access in a snapshot when booking a hotel. If you are going to make changes, make the app more efficient, not less so. Change it back!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-07 3
For general non specific searches this can be an awesome app...BUT it's just not as easy a search engine as Yelp.    If you want to add a review for a new business or restaurant it's almost impossible.   We travel a lot and enjoy new places etc. and also like to share with others what we enjoyed.   Unfortunately, I find myself using Yelp more simply because Trip Advisor is more often than not too hard to manipulate for specific sites, restaurants or businesses.  Forget even writing  reviews on specific places, UNLESS reviews are already on the list.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 5
We are 3 weeks into a month long trip and could not wait until home because how awesome this app has been. We have used it the whole trip for hotels, food, and things to do. Sometimes
used mom and pop places and sometimes chains.  Every one without exception have been just as advertised!!! We have not had a bad hotel or a bad meal. It has made this trip so much easier. It also allowed us to meet some really awesome people!!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
Best app by far.  I planned a family vacation all through Trip Advisor and I am now working on a second vacation for the month of August. The best part is, The Things to Do  tab, it allows you to see all the things within the vicinity which you would like with cost...it saves a ton of time and allows you to plan in advance. There is just so much to say that is beneficial, love the fact that you can filter just to what you need!
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 1
They added the ability to save items to your "favorite" list, which would be great if it didn't take you back to the start of browsing search results every time.  The web site itself has gone downhill, and it seems the app just gets worse too. Do the people that write and maintain the tripadvisor site/app just never bother to actually test anything before the commit the changes?

The app crashes, is painfully slow if you aren't on a super high speed connection and is worthless if you don't have a reliable Internet connection. You are almost better served by using safari and google to search tripadvisor content then to bother with this app or the site itself.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-09 1
you ruined a perfectly functioning app.  where is the index of hotel photos?  they are on a new app of hotels?!! what is the point of having two apps that are similar with the city one not having the photos because they are on the hotel app?  photos are essential when deciding where to stay.  if you have a non updated version of the city app, don't update or you will be extremely disappointed.  please put the hotel photos back on the individual city app.  and please don't mix the professional photos in with reviewer photos.  keep them separate like the good old days. this update crashes constantly.  i want to know what was wrong with the previous version because this update is a complete flop.
Version 6.5 2013-02-09 5
Thanks for helping me every day! I start using tripadvisor since 2012 and because of it , I can make a good living. I work at the Westin Playa Conchal and everyone knows me . They have read about me in tripadvisor. By the way, some people think that these site is not reliable ;  They making a mistake for tripadvisor has zero fake tolerance; so if you are a person who wants a opinion . Download these app and get the truth.
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 4
Very good info from fellow travelers. Be sure to read many reviews; its not always easy to know the background of a writer. A single individual may or may not have a lot of experience traveling to form a good comparison to other experiences so best to read multiple. 
Would be Interesting if there were an optional brief survey to fill out as a reviewer- how many trips per year, which countries or cities, languages fluent, etc. Readers would have an idea of the persons background.
Version 6.6 2012-10-19 5
Trip advisor is my favorite app.  My husband and I travel often for business and this app is THE BEST!   We use it for hotels, restaurants, and things to do.  We have never been disappointed with the reviews, and the high rated restaurants are always very good.   We may not agree with all the lower ratings, obviously people have different tastes in food, but it really helps to have the opinions of other people.  Best app for anyone who travels.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-28 3
First off the lady named darci / manager  is a complete ignorant person. She's short rude and snobby towards people staying. How she has a job I have no clue. She needs to find a new career. She actually rolled her eyes to a old lady I was behind and was very rude to me and short on simple request. Only reason I gave 3 star was the nice lady named Sara behind the counter that works night time. Always nice and perky and makes you feel welcomed. Person like her should have stacks position. Manager should be friendly like Sara was to all people I saw enter act with her.
Version 6.6 2013-04-26 5
I use Trip Advisor for researching everything when going to a hotel, restaurant, or an activity.  By providing information about the reviewers, I am able to find those with credibility and reviews the way I write them.  It is especially help to read the insights and suggestions offered by other reviewers.  These are very helpful, and that is why this app is on every device I use.  This app is indispensable.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 1
This could be handy little app if it offered up to date information, an improved UI and some more utility. 
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-13 5
Trip Advisor has become more interactive since I used it to plan a trip last year. I love it because hotels, restaurants, and activities are rated by people that have actually been there. I stayed in a hotel in Italy that was recommended by this app's community and was happy that I did! Great experience. Plus I found activities to do on the fly when I had two extra unplanned days on a vacation. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS APP.
Version 8.5 2014-02-25 3
This has most of the functionality of the TripAdvisor site. However, if you contribute lots of photos and reviews to TA, you might want to access your reviews list. This is especially so if you want to travel back to a location and you're trying to remember the hotel you liked and stayed at (another benefit of writing reviews). However, I can't find any Reviews or My Reviews option on this app. I thought it might be accessible when clicking the drop down menu on my name but that's not the case.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-13 5
It's all right here. Unlike the travel book, you get the most current information!! I booked a trip at the highest rated hotel, had the most and best ratings from customers. Then went to restaurants in the area and did the same thing! In about 30 minutes!! Great app. All info including directions, other places to visit is all there. No more travel books that collect dust after the trip!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-20 4
works well, used on vacation in saint augustine fl.  use app for reviews & directions as well as mapping out our daily routes.. but found to also ask locals for they help highly with restaurants, we found some wonderful eateries with a review of 3 stars but talked with locals and some turned out to be 4 & 5 star ratings for us.. this is a great app to use, i found myself using atleast 5 to 8 times daily for easy directions & mapping .. some restaurants even post their menu's
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I really enjoy reading real travelers reviews! I constantly refer to trip advisor for help in choosing hotels and places to go in new cities. This time I used the site to find the lowest airfare, too. I am happy there's an app and I like how the natives of the cities in Europe I will be visiting have put their input on it. I try to pay it back by reviewing the places I visit, too, especially if they have been wonderful or a must miss.
Version 5.6 2011-06-06 5
This app should be shown to all other developers as an example of great UI. What a beautifully implemented app. But if it was only beautiful, I would not give it 5 stars. It also WORKS elegantly and does what you'd expect it to do without getting in the way. I recently finished a road trip and this app was always there to guide me with timely information on local hotels and eateries. Big Kudos to TripAdvisor!
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 4
This is a great app with lots of information about almost anywhere that one could take a trip to. The information gets constantly updated by people like yourself. Instead of just seeing professional photographs of a hotel, restaurant etcetera you have every day people's photos which tell a true story not just the ones that the establishment wants for your to see. You can't do everything on the app as you can on the computer but there is enough info to help make decisions.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 5
Always, always, always check out hotels on Trip Advisor before you check in.   I've used TA for years now, first on my computer and now on my phone too, and I have used it numerous times to find hotels.  Reviews are mostly reliable (you always have someone who has their own motives for writing an either really good or really bad review), but if you go by the majority you're fine.  Love TA.
Version 8.5 2014-03-01 5
I have used the Trip Advisor app well over 100 times for planning / making hotel, restaurant, and recreation reservations throughout my extensive travels and have rarely been let down. It's important to still consider selections carefully for appropriateness,  but overall the reviews are very helpful and make finding great places easy to find.
Version 5.9 2012-01-24 4
This app is wonderful in many ways- all things you need to explore a new city! It's truly amazing, but I would like to see an update that allows iPhone pics to be added to reviews from mobile devices. I think that's crucial in today's world where many travelers take photos on their mobile device & there is already an expected 'write reviews' in the app itself. It seems like they just got a little lazy & didn't want to go that extra mile to put a mobile pic accessibility in it.
Version 8.5 2014-02-25 2
The design of the app is nice, but I can't figure out how to report a problem with a restaurant listing.  I searched for restaurants near me.  One that is listed is Cafe Restaurant de la Poste in Lucerne, Switzerland, but I am in North America.  I don't see an option to report a restaurant or attraction that was saved with an incorrect location.  The old design allowed me to report mistakes like that.

I use this app when I travel, but also like to read reviews of restaurants near my home.  It's so helpful to hear what other people have to say about restaurants and hotels.  TripAdvisor has not led me astray yet.  Thank you, TripAdvisor!
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 2
I would have expected to have the same functionality as the website, but that's not the case.
- the filters available on the website are not in the app.
  - unable to search based on amenities such as wifi, washer/ dryer, tv, etc..
- unable to filter for apartments/condos
- doesn't display price.  Need to get rates by going to Expedia or other websites.
- the majority if the findings do not have the option to save to "my trips"

The two distinctive features I did find useful we're 1) your "saves"
are displayed on the map 2) the interface is user friendly.

Overall, the website is the better choice than this app.
Version 5.3 2011-02-17 5
Trip Advisor is a great website and this is a great app. Get loads of info from fellow travellers about hotels, attractions and places to eat etc. I've used this app and the website to get information and guidance when booking lots of holidays and it is a great help. It gives you first hand commentary on a place rather than the hyped up, glossed up website or brochure from a hotel or travel company.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-18 5
I travel a great deal for work (and sometimes combine some pleasure :)

If you read the reviews and understand the perspective of the author(s) such reviews are invaluable.

We are not all the same; our tastes, budgets and reasons for consulting this app are all different.

I really look for "the great little gems" in places I have not visited previously.

Happy travels to you!

Being a true fan of TripAdvisor, I immediately installed it's app onto my iPad as soon as I got it.  The speed in which it works is incredible. We will definitely be using it during our trip to Santa Fe later this year so we can check out any of the great places to eat that we haven't tried yet...if there are any!

Whether on your laptop or iPhone/iPad, TripAdvisor is the best traveling companion...with the exception of my wonderful wife.

Having utilized Trip Advisor to plan our European vacation I can say it is the perfect travel planning tool!  Beginning in San Francisco, we traveled to Munich, Florence, Vienna and back to Munich.  Each and every hotel was beyond our expectations, the recommended tours and sites were exceptional and we had the time of our lives.  We will certainly use this wonderful site again when planning vacations!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 5
I've relied on TripAdvisor for recommendations all over the world. On other travel sites, you can quickly tell which reviews are written by fellow travelers and which are written by shills. TripAdvisor does a great job presenting honest reviews, letting you decide for yourself what's best. If you like the site, start writing reviews. It's a fascinating experience.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
Use Trip Advisor on every trip and when looking a restaurant near home. For hotels, I tend to stick to chains where I get points but do look for hotels that are very close to specific locations or are especially interesting, nice or quirky. For restaurants I avoid the chains and look for something that is local. I do wish that there was a "chain" filter.
Version 8.4 2014-02-03 5
I work in the IT business and I am constantly traveling all over the western part of the United States, and I love using this app to check out hotels and see what other people have to say about the places I'm staying at. I have yet to stay at a hotel where the rating on trip advisor was wrong. Love being able to see photos uploaded by real guest and not a photo shopped picture of the best room in the whole hotel.
Version 6.6 2013-02-24 3
It is impossible to refine a hotel search for specific criteria beyond location, price and quality. Those are well done and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA. Especially during peak seasonal flows, many of us travel with pets. We have a terrible time finding clean, reliable hotels. Most sites for pet travel are woefully inadequate. How hard would it be to include this as an additional search filter? That would bring in helpful reviews that would not only enhance the site experience but also improve the field.
Version 5.8 2011-11-29 5
There is really no other app that has such great information for researching hotels, restaurants and activities in an area. On numerous occasions I have used the app to help me make reservations on the fly. No other app gives a full circle experience of first finding what is around me, then giving me the tools to educate myself on different options, and then booking directly through the application
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-22 3
I use this app for every trip.  I've done a lot of reviews on it, too.  I have some problems with it, though.  First of all, whenever I click on to another app and then come back, even after just a few minutes, it takes me back to the home screen where I have to type all of the information in again.  Also, it needs more filters.  Maybe I'm just not finding them, but I can figure out how to sort by price or hotel brand.  I would really love this app if they would make these small changes.
Version 6.6 2013-10-26 5
Squid's is an excellent restaurant in food, service and atmosphere. The seafood is topnotch with a lot of variety offered. They always have several vegetables to substitute for starches . The fresh spinach was delicious tonight. Besides their regular dessert menu tonight they had maple pecan pie with cinnamon ice cream-delicious! I have been coming to Squid's for years and have never been disappointed.

I love trip advisor. Anytime I go on a website like Orbitz, Expedia, Priceline, etc. to book a hotel trip, I always use trip advisor first to see real customer photos and reviews of a hotel instead of only seeing the professional photos found on other sites. Therefore, when I found out that they have an app just like the regular website, I quickly downloaded it.
Version 5.92 2012-01-23 4
This app is great!!! I used to travel for a living and I would live by this!! It has never led me down the wrong road, where to stay, where to eat....always on point. I hated eating at chain restaurants and the  near me know function helped me to find good local spots to eat and then on the other end allowed me to find the best hotels in any city that fit into my price range, had the amenities I was looking for and were in the best location for business and then also enjoying the city's nightlife. I highly recommend it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 5
I like how the map figure integrates with the locations being reviewed to give you an idea of where they are located. Also like how you can zoom in and out on the map to modify options. Having noted these positives it would be nice if the app allowed one to vote for helpful posts. Overall this will be great for use while on the road to complement the full web version.
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 4
For the most part, app works as intended. When I write reviews and then navigate to another app, the review disappears and I am returned to the home screen. 
Fortunately, it saved my review data so I didn't have to re-enter it.  But still disorienting and inconvenient. Otherwise, no other major gripes yet.

As for Trip Advisor service as a whole - I love it, and their website has been one of my primary sources of info for global travel for more than 4 years now. Thanks, TripAdvisor!

OMG this place is better than any place we have gone in a LONG time!!  We fell in love with the Napoleons!!! Everything we ate was better than the previous item!!!!

Great atmosphere in the bakery and the neighborhood was unbelievable cool!!!! Next stop.... Carlo's in February!!

I wish to commend a few persons I met on my vacation in Jamaica a few days ago. Mr Clive Miller Miss Sasha Benjamin and Mr Durrant food and beverage this hotel has some tremendous workers but the ones I mention went over and beyond to make our vacation a memorably one and we can't wait to return to this property to experience their warmth kindness and their unselfishness. thank you all and keep up the good work
Version 6.6 2013-02-10 4
Great app for mapping out vacation restaurant options and things to do. I have trusted trip advisor for all my vacations! I find when I'm going through a long list of options, I like to star my favorites. Maybe it's user error but every time I star a favorite, it takes me back to the first page of options...would love for this bug to be fixed to minimize scrolling. For cities that have more than 100 options, it can be time consuming to see the whole list.
Version 6.2 2012-07-13 5
TripAdvisor is my #1 travel companion....well , my 2nd if you count Terry!

I will NOT book a room until I check TA and then only if the reviews are acceptable.

You can count on them to be accurate ESPECIALLY IF the reviewer has many reviews under their belt.  A 1review gripe I ignore as sour grapes but if the vibe of many reviewers, especially seasoned travelers is good, I book it.
Otherwise I skip it.
Version 6.1 2012-05-01 3
I'm trying to use the TA app while on vacation in Costa Rica and I'm surprised at how useless it is. A restaurant search in Manuel Antonio shows 8 results, but the TA website shows over 40.  Why is that? The "near me now" search shows... nothing. I think because very few restaurants around here are geo-coded, and street addresses are moot for many restaurants. So my work-around is to use TA's website (which ANNOYINGLY keeps reminding me to download the app) and then use the Maps app to find the restaurant. 

Also, the app only works in landscape mode, also annoying.
Version 5.7 2011-07-05 4
I love this app. The functionality and availability of resources is equivalent to the full trip advisor site but in a more streamlined format. One complaint about this app is that the view more button is located very close to and right above the home button, which I have accidentally hit several times. An improvement to this could be to cause the next page to automatically load as you scroll down through the reviews/ forum posts. Overall, wonderful, helpful, and very useful!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-24 5
Well ladies, I am certain that if your mate is anything like mine......I always end up making ALL of the decisions about where to go, what to do & where to eat!!  I have been using TA  for 6 or 7 years and can count our lousy experiences on less than one hand.....so, needless to say.....I still have my job as "recreational advisor" in our family!!  Thank you Trip Advisor for making me look so good!!
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 1
Hubby and I use TripAdvisor all the time.  It is the first place we come when we need to know anything about a new city we are traveling to.

   BUT!!!!!!!

I REALLY don't like this app.  The way it is set up is not reader friendly.  Reading reviews is difficult with the reviews on the left side of the screen and you are not able to expand it or make it bigger to read easily.  I will not be using this app unless this is fixed.  But I will still use trip advisor website!  On a weekly and sometimes daily basis!

I hope this can be changed.  One reason I LOVE my iPad is my ability to spread, widen, change my view of a page!
Version 6.6 2013-04-29 5
I have come to rely on this app, it is excellent when traveling on business or pleasure. I no longer have to research ahead of time where we are going to eat, I just pull up the app and usually have something picked out in under 10 minutes. Same for attractions, I love that you can sort by popularity, this gives me a quick way to find things for us to do in an area we have never been.

Went to all sites in Seattle then w/ this aps help we enjoyed a trip over to Yakima valley,up to grand coulee dam and back via Wenatchee and highway 12 to Seatac and flew home. All this was spur of the moment. If you already use & like the website this is as good & reliable n packed w/ all kinds of I info n reviews. must have!

Great app when traveling
Trip Advisor is the future for not only travel reviews but also will become a booking engine. The only one thing is of you are a business owner and you receive reviews that are not real it is very hard to get a dishonest review removed and it can hurt your business. I am not sure hoe trip advisor can monitor this better but it has to change to get honest reviews.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 5
Tip for travelers:  Don't simply go by the star rating of hotels, attractions, etc., but also check out the reviews and comments posted by others.  While the stars provide a good basis, each person is unique, and something that is important for one person might not be as important for you.  Thanks TripAdvisor for providing an excellent platform for travelers to exchange information!
Version 8.5 2014-02-28 5
I love this app & TA, but recently I've encounter an issue with the search function (won't load of populate search suggestions). I wasn't sure how else to report it but if anyone else is having this problem, it should probably be looked into. 

Otherwise, TA is seriously the greatest! I use it for all my travel needs. The reviews are typical spot-on and I trust TA for all my trips, big or small!

Just by chance we happened by this darling little place, that had 3 empty tables, 2with reservations. The server was extremely busy with 30 people to serve and did a fabulous job. She recommended the 2specials plus their 2best sellers, we decided one one of the specials and one of the favorites. Again, fabulous ! Then came the dessert crepe, absolutely declious ! Thinking of going back for breakfast.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 3
The app doesn't work as well as just going to the website.  Searching locations is frustrating. Online, you can, for instance, pick an island, and it will either rank hotels across the whole island or give you it's rank by city/area.  With the app, neither option works very well.  

Also, I attempted to write a review on the app, but then realized I had no option for the specific ratings (i.e. cleanliness, service, value, etc.).  Without those rating options, leaving a review does nothing as far as ranking the hotel.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-19 5
I never have wifi while looking for a hotel so I can never read reviews before I go to a place but oh well that's more my fault....other than that I love reviewing hotels I stay at this will probably be the last night I use the app for a little while but that is just because I do not stay in hotels that often only when I'm on vacation once or maybe twice a year for 2-4 weeks.
Version 1.0 2008-07-11 5
Can filter restaurants by distance from you (uses gps), price per meal and how many stars out of 5.  Can also read in depth reviews of each restaurant from users. I tried it at 2 rest. And it was right on!  My city has over 1600 rest. In their database. 

Speed was fast on thurs before 3g launch. Maybe reported speed problems are due to servers being slammed?  Best app I have found so far and has already saved me money.
Version 8.4 2014-01-31 4
I use the app almost exclusively for restaurants and there is some functionality that has gone missing or should be added.  First, I can't seem to find how to save a restaurant anymore...my older saves are still there, but can't add a save in the iPad app.  Also, it would be awesome to have the ability to make personal notes (like on the full web version) or at least to be able to see the notes I have made.

Overall I still love the app

I certainly don't want to miss good food and fun nearby.

This app is so useful. The list of information from this app is very complete. I especially like the pin point function which not only show the location of the place but also name of the place. So when I don't have wifi/ data roaming in a different country, it allows me to do a screenshot and use that as a reference in regards to cross street and what not when going local attractions near by.
Version 6.6 2013-03-09 5
Love the search engine and the reviews (though I should read them before I go out more often). I like submitting my honest reviews as I see them and am glad people can take what I have to say and make their own opinion.
I use the site a lot when traveling to search out places to eat and stay and some are spot on and some not. That is why you have to make a personal decision on things.
Version 6.6 2013-04-01 5
Love trip-advisor, they have been spot on for advise, and a great tool for getting the most out of a vacation. And through Trip Advisor made booking easy and got a better price then going to the hotel.  They booked me, tThrough Travelocity and we got a nice room where we wanted for $176 compared to $253 from hotel.  Saving us $77 a nite, that's huge!  The hotel across was $400 a nite!  Love this app.  Lets you plan a great vacation

I'm not sure who is rating these places but I find that many of the "top 10" in mine and nearby cities aren't even close to what I'd expect.

One issue I found with the app is that if you are in the middle of doing something and need to switch over to another app, it doesn't remember where you left off. I was writing a lengthy review of a nearby restaurant and had I look something up on the internet to make sure my info was correct, and when I switched back to TripAdvisor, it brought me back to the home page.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-26 5
Tripadvisor is a great app/website that provides excellent,common sense, critical information for the traveller no matter where you go. Conditions of the facility/restaurant, cost, service provided by the staff, and more, are at your fingertips. Feedback is provided by actual travelers so you are provided with honest results. A definite place to check when you aren't sure!
Version 8.5 2014-03-02 5
I use the app when I am in town once in a while but spending 3 weeks in Nuevo Vallarta it has become my go to app. After going to our normal restaurants using TripAdvisor to find good new restaurants has been a breeze. One night I even used it as a menu and ordered my dishes from people recommendations and had a great meal. As the saying goes don't leave home without it.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 1
There was nothing wrong with the old version, and this new one eliminates one of the apps most useful features: previously your saved restaurants, hotels, etc, were automatically sorted by location, now all of them are shown at once which is really confusing.

True you can ask to see your saved hotels in say only Chicago, but if you then want to look for your saved restaurants in Chicago, you have to do a second sort.  This is a pain especially when you are in a location with a poor signal.

If you don't have this app, it's certainly worthwhile, but if you do take a careful look at the latest version before you upgrade.
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 5
My husband and I booked a four hour tour with Gavin from Milestone Tours Auckland New Zealand following a 13 hour flight. We had a full morning seeing so many wonderful sites around Auckland.  Gavin is very friendly and personable and extremely knowledgeable. We almost forgot  how tired we were!   He was very attentive  to the group and seemed to really enjoy his job. Thank for your great tour Gavin.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 5
I've used Trip Advisor for the past 5 years for all trips we take and I LOVE it!
I check so many things via TA such as hotels, restaurants, local points of interest and reviews just 
to name a few. You have to take reviews with a grain of salt because sometimes experiences
are just going to be different. Overall we have always found the site easy to navigate and current 
with info.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 1
I travel a lot, and this used to be my favorite app for it. The comprehensive listings of hotels, attractions, maps and reviews used to function flawlessly, and the street view option was invaluable for planning out how I would recognize my hotel once I actually arrived. 
Not any more.
Since they remained the app entirely, the results for categories are scattered, out of order and glitchily scramble based on what the map view shows, the street view function was jettisoned entirely, and the standard map view often shows the wrong location for hotels or attractions, as I've confirmed multiple times by looking them up in the desktop version of other map services.
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 4
Finally - A travel site based on Real Traveler's reviews.  Trip Advisor has broken the old, tired format of online travel services.  Get the nitty gritty on a new restaurant, whether in your neighborhood or across the globe.  No hype - Just real reviews by travelers like you and me.

The travel advisories are handy as can be.  If you want, Trip Advisor will keep an eye on airfares for that upcoming trip.

Trip Advisor is user friendly and the mosr handy travel aid I have found.
Version 5.9 2011-11-07 5
I've been using Trip Advisor for several years as my main source of info for European travel. The iPad app is very well designed and makes it even easier to find what I'm looking for. Reviews are very useful and information is timely. Highly recommended--but as one other reviewer noted, you have to have wifi access (which is not always available), so plan ahead.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-06 5
This app is excellent for support when visiting any place you want to go and do not know how it is, or what they think people who have already been there and can give you as a reference to the place, as well as to access pictures posted by themselves and thus vicitantes. much help to me, I go and vusconel only place I want to go and see the real references and decide if I like it or not
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-26 5
We adore this hotel! Only 7 rooms, price is right, wonderful staff and ambiance. Converted immense home right in the Old City of Cartegena. This place used to be a party location for US celebrities (sp?) back in the day and we understand why. This is now our ONLY destination hotel in Cartegena. If you can afford $275 a night, you will never regret staying here! Viva Colombia;)
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
I like food. I use this app to narrow down sites I want to visit while on the road, which I do frequently. Also, I have written many reviews after visiting so that others might see. You can get a nice 'feel' for a place by reading multiple reviews. I have not been to one restaurant in which the bulk of reviews were out of line with my experience. Saves me time and frustration!
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 1
Country inn and suites did not pick us up, as paid for. The night manager would not answer the phone, and I called 9 times!! We were at N.O. airport for more than 30 mins, calling and calling!! Ended up taking a taxi, and was treated so rude, and refused to stay there the night . So, at one in the morning, we drove back to baton rouge!! We were told to call the owner/manager in the morning, and she was very ugly about the situation . Refusing to reimburse any monies. The man, who did not answer our calls told us that , this happens all the time. He also told us the people over him, did not give a !?@!!! Really? Don't trust them to transport you to or from the airport!!! THUMBS DOWN!!!!! On a scale of 1 to 10, they get -10!!!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-05 4
It would be helpful if the app allowed you to access more of your own information.
For instance, I am unable to respond to other traveler inquiries unless (inbox) unless on the actual site.
My only other disappointment with the app is that instead of having one simple well rounded app, there is this one plus all of the other add-on apps.
It would be great to have everything in one place instead of several.
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
We like to take Roadtrips and don't know quite where we will end up for the night.  This app is great for when you roll into a new town and don't know what accommodations are there. It shows you all the hotels and motels on a map.  You can zoom in to see the details of the location.  You can sort by price or popularity, and when you have found the one you want, just book it.
Version 5.6 2011-08-18 5
I use this app extensively; perhaps more than any other. I travel a lot but I'm not a road warrior so heavy travelers will love it all the more. There is some magic going on and I'm too old to believe in magic. I send a confirmation email to Tripit and almost instantly it is returned as a full itinerary and trackable going forward. I give it 5 stars and I'm not one to give praise lightly. Worth every penny.
Version 5.2 2011-08-07 3
Helpful tool, and i use it all the time when traveling, but...1) Not as useful as the website when it comes to looking at reviews.  The page set-up forces the map too occupy 2/3 of the screen and you must click each review to read more than the first few words.  The website interface for reading reviews is more usefully arranged.  2) the interface for adding captions to photos is TERRIBLE if you want to put in more than a word or two.  

Best things?  The "near me" search and the option to see satellite  and "on the street" views of the places.
Version 6.2 2012-07-08 4
I love being able to check Trip Advisor on my phone or iPad to see what people think about hotels, excursions, restaurants, etc before we book. It's easy to use and I enjoy writing reviews of places we've been and love to share so others can have the same great vacation. I also like to post reviews about some of our unique restaurants in my area to let visitors know what great food we have here and our personal local favorites.
Version 8.1 2013-11-10 3
I would love to use this app, but find it useless to participate in the site as a community member.  It's ok as a basic user (search for restaurants, etc.) but,even when logged in one cannot access one's own profile. No access to prior forum posts, messages, etc. etc.   

Using the app pushes you back to passive lurker mode rather than active community member which is the whole point of tripadvisor.

I will continue using the website rather than this app until that is fixed.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-09 5
The TripAdvisor App is a shorter and better way to look up something instead of going onto their website and wasting more time! Sometimes, you can't always find what you are looking for so you have to go on the website but, it's the majority. I do all of my bookings with TripAdvisor through the app or through the Internet and it still works very well! Great job!!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 5
Find app has been useful everywhere we have traveled. It has gave us wonderful direction thanks to so many reviewers doing all the foot work for us. So when going somewhere, we have found the reviews to be most helpful and very accurate. As far as dining, it's also nice being able to make reservations with certain restaurants.
Version 6.2 2012-07-14 5
We moved to a new area a year and a half ago and I didn't know about trip advisor. We are moving again and now I do. Wow! The reviews are spot on and have saved me time, trouble and heart ache. If you travel with dogs- get this app! I now read the review then call ahead to verify pet rules. And I book through their partners and safe half the price! Amazing! Love it. You will too. Also great for restaurants too.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 1
Trip Advisor is a useful resource but they have made the ipad app very challenging. I wonder if the developers have actually used the app to plan their travels. 

Only 20 hotels are shown at a time. For cities like New York, that is simply a poor experience.  Recommendation for developers: use scrolling. 

Map view only shows you a map of the 20 hotels whose page you are on. It needs to show all the hotels for the map region that is being viewed.

You can't search within the results of a city. When I am viewing the hotels for a city and tap the search bar, the keyboard pops up, disappears then pops up and disappears again. Quite annoying.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-29 5
The Trip Advisor Community has come through over and over during a US summer road trip. Every time we tried the lower rated places we got a less than stellar experience and when we went with the better ratings we couldn't have been happier!!! So helpful, easy to use app. Occasionally need to give it a minute but that is more a reflection of connection speeds out in the boonies.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 4
Very helpful app to have while traveling. I love being able to research hotels and b&b's on the fly, as well as restaurants and things to do. I can't imagine traveling without it. 

Cons - I wish it was available offline for those times when there is no network connection, maybe some way to download certain towns or regions. Also I don't like how it kicks me off when there is no network and then I have to start all over again.

Overall though, very nice resource.
Version 6.6 2013-01-31 3
For the most part it does what I want tripadvisor to do, help me choose what I want to do, where I want to go, where I should stay when I get there and what I should put in my belly.

What I don't like is that it makes me re-log into tripadvisor from my iPad each and every time I use the app even with remember me on. It will also freeze or crash semi-frequently.

Other than that it is pretty ok.

Picture it this way, my unstimulating review of the tripadvisor app is pretty much what the tripadvisor app is, unstimulating.
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 5
This app is so helpful.  I really like it, it is so nice how it has things from zip codes to cities and photos of the place. I found different restaurants around the place that I am going and everything is just so easy to find. This is so much for a free app. Every time I go somewhere this will be my go to app. Thank you for making such a great and easy to use app!
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
I used it for our cross country trip to compare different amusement parks, find local restaurants vs fast food only that would be close to our route,  and of course find hotels. Readers reviews, when there are enough of them, help make the best trip possible. reliable info   helps set expectations and avoid expensive and time consuming disappointment. Great tool.
Version 6.6 2013-01-04 4
Trip Advisor on a PC is my favorite tool for learning about a city I am planning to visit. The iPhone app simply puts the same capability in your pocket. I have written reviews for TA and they appear to be taking the time to read them and judge reasonableness before publishing. Some sites providing similar services seem to publish almost everything submitted; much content probably from the businesses being reviewed. I trust TA's reviews.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 5
I've been using Trip Advisor for quite some time. When I bought iPad, i downloaded this app. This app proves to be one of my essential app. I love how fast the information is retrieve, the map, detailed guide, the simple and easy to use interface. Once again Trip Advisor manages to stay ahead of the competitors. Great Job...
Version 7.0.1 2013-11-08 5
This is an overall great update and had made more quickness and also just a smoother running app , tripadvisor itself is the best app to find a restaurant or hotel that suits your needs , love the consistent users and current up to date reviews only draw is the distance filter is no longer there so it sets 50 mi radius bit far when u want to go 20 or less but besides that amazing!!
Version 8.0 2013-10-12 2
They are trying to push vacation listings, but you can't drill down to a neighborhood . Orlando is a big area and you get a zillion listings that come up. I need one near a particular neighborhood. You can't search for that and going through all their postings for Orlando isn't feasible. Use airbnb instead. They know what they are doing. You can put in any address where you need to be and listings pop up all around it. How can you miss something as simple as this? Those that have a listing on trip advisor must be losing out. I think they are now too big to care.
Version 5.6 2011-09-06 5
I've used all the travel sites, many times, TripAdvisor is BY FAR the fastest loading & most easily navigated & up to date comparisons of flight costs & times.  Used it in Europe as well to find inexpensive flights on some of the smaller airlines.  I love the notes by users & tips, as often the best finds are from individuals rather than from travel guides.
Version 5.9 2011-11-12 3
This is one of those apps that adds a feature like GPS searches near your location, but takes away so much of the functionality of the website in a browser that its use is really limited.

Searching multiple websites for hotel prices and translation of reviews are not possible in app. If you've read five reviews for a place, the back button will have to be clicked six times before you get back to your main list of selections. Many locations don't appear on the map. 

Could be better, much better.
Version 6.1 2012-05-02 4
I have found a few gems for hotels by trusting Trip Advisor reviews, have also avoided a few potential bad experiences.  This is now my go to app when traveling.  Could be a little more user friendly, I would like to be able to put in a specific address and search a radius around that address.  Would also like to be able to toggle back easily to the hotel list.  Over all, I find this to be quite a useful app.
Version 6.2 2012-07-11 5
I use this App faithfully prior to booking anywhere.  The links directly to hotel web sites, member reviews and traveler photos make my choices easy!  I've used it for several years and have it saved on my iPhone for quick checks on restaurants and in the iPad as well when researching hotels and attractions...it never lets us down!
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
Thank you for this helpful app!  I got good information for my recent trip to Tahiti including lists of what to pack and places to see.  Because of high prices and limited availability of over the counter meds, sun block, batteries, etc., this app helped prepare us for the trip.  Now, we are on Maui and are reading reviews and viewing pictures to help us decide which restaurants to try.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
The Tripadvisor app has made finding local places a breeze. From reading to writing reviews, this app allows you to quickly search  what others are saying about a particular business. 

TIP: Use it when you're out of town to find those local, highly rated restaurants. So far, it's been correct 100% of the time.
Version 6.1 2012-06-10 1
Like most apps, someone gets to the to be "edgy". Part of the problem is that TA connects you to several sites for reservations that are really aggressive in trying to push stuff at you instead of helping to make reservations with useless pop-ups. Please just give me the information I need without pop-ups, animations, flipping advertisements or whatever else you have that distract from getting my tasks done. I will spend more time on a site that lets me do what I need without distractions and will be more likely to go to advertisements that seem they are there to help me rather than trying to shove stuff in my face. Treat me like a person instead a set of "eyeballs!"
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Sometimes the iPad app doesn't provide anything you couldn't get from the web site, but this one does strip away the unnecessary stuff and is also easy to navigate. Information blocks expand when you want to see the contents, for example the reviews. It's very quick, and it's easy to move the map around and refresh it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-01 5
Love this app, but please fix this following behavior:

Checking out restaurants at a certain location. I'm on page 4 of the restaurant list. Click on a restaurant and click to view photos. Exiting the photo browser, and clicking "list" brings you back to page 1 of the original restaurant list, not page 4. Is a pain in the a*s. Otherwise great app.
Version 6.6 2013-03-12 1
Trip Advisor provides very useful information but extremely difficult to search. For example, I am vacationing in Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo  Mexico.  I set the filter to Zihuatanejo and I want to find information on Manzanillo bay in Zihuatanejo. The app takes me to Manzanillo Mexico. I want to search for a restaurant in Zihuatanejo by name. It shows me every restaurant with that name in their system around the world and then I have to search thru the list to find the restaurant I want. Even though I set the filter to Zihuatanejo it combines the Ixtapa restaurants in the list. Very awkward to say the least. It needs a great deal of work to improve its functionality.
Version 6.2 2012-06-17 3
The app works well, but there is an issue with the algorithm that determines which currency to show hotel prices on.  The currency is determined based on the language your device is set to.  I live in the USA, but I prefer British or UK English, so when I use the app, I have to change my language for hotel prices to show in USD.  The app should have a settings page with a currency selection option, it shouldn't be decided by the language used.

Aside from that, TripAdvisor is still the app I consult before deciding on any hotel to stay in.
Version 6.2 2012-08-04 5
I use this app for all my traveling. It gives a honest look at places as sometimes companies hype up their own place. I think you have to take some of the reviews with a grain of salt... Some people complain about the dumbest things!! I like to look through the photos to really get a sense of what the place is like. Overall, this app is easy to use with lots of useful information!!!
Version 6.6 2012-10-22 5
The IPAD version of Trip Advisor is unparalleled in the Ether.  Ratings are consistently reliable with bad reviews an insignificant  factor.  Trip Advisor's are by and large--literate and reliable in their reviews. Most who say that food or service is bad...have a valid reason that is worthy of reading.  Flamers and disgruntled raters with an ax to grind....are rare.  Highly recommended by this family.
Version 5.8 2011-09-25 5
I use Trip Advisor all the time. I have never been steered wrong since the reviews are from real people. You learn to spot the bad reviews from the sour pusses from the honest reviews that ordinary people give.  I travel frequently and always check out hotels and restaurants before I go there. If it has consistent bad reviews, I stay away. The app is very user friendly.
Version 5.6 2011-06-28 5
Amazingly useful app. The seamless combination of a map view with the trip advisor rankings makes this interface far more useful then in a browser. Hard to go back to the web site after using this app.

Another plus on gps equipped units and finding stuff near to you. Just the restaurants fill in the huge gaps left by something like zagat which just covers metro locations. 

Love it.
Version 8.1.1 2013-12-15 4
I went with a friend to pick up her snowbird mom and bring her back to Chicago for the holidays. My surprise was where we stayed. A totally awesome rental complex right on the Gulf. I will sum this up quickly as there is a wait list so not sure when I get to go back. A few words: Clean, spacious, all included, pool, hot tub, Gulf, balcony's, condo living, bikes, boats, umbrellas on beach, shuttle, Marvelous!! I can't wait to get the chance to go back.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 4
We use Trip Advisor ALL of the time! I love reading the reviews and hearing other peoples opinions. I especially like reading the "terrible" reviews to try and figure out whether or not the reviewer is just disgusted with life in general. The owner responses are a special touch and I understand wanting to comment, but sometimes it's just not necessary. I especially love the app when I need a last minute suggestion, always very helpful. Thanks Trip Advisor!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
Practically stayed In PJ's our whole stay! Super relaxing, comfy, clean, not to mention ...romantic! Very nice place to stay. Don't expect the Four Seasons here, this is rustic, open air, wildlife, tall pines ...New Mexico, you'll love it. Staff was very nice, in fact once they knew we were celebrating anniversary, included a complimentary bottle of champagne, wonderful! 
Okay I gotta go .....I'm planning my next trip to SBC!
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
I love trip advisor. Helps decision making a lot easier. People must realize though before making a decision about a place read all reviews. I think some people are in plain bad moods when they rate places and they couldn't be more wrong. When reading mixed reviews it sometimes seems like people are talking about 2 different places. Trip Advisor is a great tool.
Version 6.6 2013-01-13 5
I travel for work and also enjoy weekend getaways. This app helps you narrow down your options and gives you real up-to-date reviews on anything you might want to do while you're visiting a new area. Download this app to help you pick a hotel, restaurant and find local shops and activities. Reviewers share the inside scoop with you on anywhere you wanna go!
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
Forgot our printed travel materials & print ours from Trip Advisor at home when we left for a 2 week vacation on the Big Island. This app has been invaluable in checking reviews & recommendations for restaurants, beaches & points of interest. LOVE that you can press a button for 'Current Location' and get local recommendations  even if you don't know where you are!
Version 5.6 2011-06-20 5
Always liked TripAdvisor on the web - now on iPad is super. So easy to use -same great traveler reviews. Always feel more confident reading what "real"travelers think.  Plus you can see user photos of hotels to her the 'real' story.  And the street view showed me major conduction going on at the front of a hotel I was considering in San Fran. Dodged a bullet on that one thanks to TripAdvisor :)
Version 6.6 2013-03-25 5
I love exploring new places, and using the map and panning and zooming I can browse the list very easily and plan things to do on weekends. I've used it for many other things, but as a discovery of thing around it is a good send. By reading the reviews and watching the pictures, choosing great activities is so much easier. A weekend warrior best tool.
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 3
The app is great for locating lodging...the problem is, many listings don't have any means of reserving, or even contact info for the facility, aside from address. 
For example, there are several properties in Wimberley, Texas that we're interested in, but have no way of checking availability, specific price, or calling operators. I understand that the app may have no control over this lack of detail, but I have to question the usefulness even including listings with no means of contacting or renting lodging.
Version 8.2 2013-12-01 5
We love this app in our household. Any time we go out of town or some place new I always make sure to write reviews. This is because this app is so helpful in our choosing where to eat for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! The more people review the better the app becomes! I never go somewhere out of town without taking my fellow "advisors" advice!
Version 6.2 2012-06-14 5
I loaded the app and used it for 4 hours non stop. I researched all my bucket list trips! We all know the reviews are the best in the industry, because they are mostly from true travelers. I travel often and I read the reviews as I plan my trips. Trust me, the reviews are usually 98.5% accurate!!! 
This app lays out your destination and hotels and information,pics in a simple and smart manner!!!
Version 8.1 2013-11-10 5
As a person who travels a fair amount I find the Trip Advisor app to be indispensable. I have really never been disappointed by a suggestion from Trip Advisor. I especially like the restaurant search option, you can find incredible places to eat in new places that you never would have found on your own.
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 4
this app is very good and benefits from the huge number of existing reviews. however, some details are missing which would make it even better. for example, when searching for a restaurant, can sort based on popularity or distance. what about a hybrid? for example, I want to see the most popular restaurants in a 10 mile radius, not the most popular restaurants in the city of Sao Paulo which could be 3 hrs away.
Version 5.92 2012-02-06 5
Unlike many other snobby websites, tripadvisor has input from middle class travelers like you and me who can tell you in plain english what they like or don't like about a hotel. I love the reliability of its reviews and being able to order them to see the most recent or by ge group. A hotel could be great for the grannies, burnout the hipsters, or vice versa!
Version 6.4 2012-08-21 5
I use this app to both check out potential hotels, eateries, and attractions as well as to write my own reviews of places we visit. I like everyone's frankness. The only thing I'd tweak is to have it set up to automatically load my login info. I don't like having to log in each time I want to use the application. Other than that, I think it's top shelf!
Version 6.6 2013-02-24 5
I have used on several trips now to evaluate lodging, dining and things to do. I've found the reviews as a whole very helpful. I would like it if there were more subcategories in the things to do such as museums, zoo, sports arena, etc.  An option to change each list hierarchy for distance, price, rating also would help.
Version 6.4 2012-08-07 2
The new Point Me There feature sounds interesting, but I can't try it.  When I select a destination (a restaurant, for example), I see the Point Me There button above the Map/Call/Save buttons for a moment but then it just disappers.  I've tried reinstalling the app and it still does the same thing.  FYI, I'm using an iPhone 3GS (running the latest version of iOS) and not logged in (via Facebook or TripAdvisor).

Also, I was going to email this to support rather than leaving a review here, but I can't find a way to contact TripAdvisor support unless I log in via Facebook or TripAdvisor.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 4
This is my go to app when I'm traveling. I also like Yelp when I want to search specifically in a smaller area. A couple of things keep me from giving it five stars. Some of the restaurant and event pages need more thorough information including hours and links to web pages, which are frequently lacking and inconsistent. But this is still the best app out there and I find the reviews more reliable than those on Yelp.
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 3
Once you sign up, they start. Sending you "deals" that simply push other websites.  Not like Travelzoo or others that has true deals.  They are also now actively redirecting your searches for info on a city to hotel booking pages.  You have to search so much harder to locate reviews. Unfortunately this website seems to be moving away from sharing reviews and moving towards actively generating money through redirecting you to booking websites and false "deals".
Version 5.8 2011-09-05 4
This has been very helpful during my trip across country, and I find the reviews on this app to be the most useful of all the many available. My only complaint is that I'm staying in a wonderful place in Harvie Heights near Banff, and the only hotel listed here is the one next door, which is run by some really nasty people ... I want to recommend where I'm staying now - the Banff Boundary Inn - but can't find any way to suggest adding them!
Version 6.1 2012-05-06 4
Excellent barbecue and ribs in  a casual and comfortable settling, with responsive services at your table or bar. Ypu may be waited on by Sharon, who is always friendly and helpful. Generous portions. In fact the "sandwich" barbecue with two side dishes is an ample and delicious meal  for $6-7.  I have lived in Acton for 40 years and eaten everywhere within 20 miles. Po's has become a favorite for lunch or dinner! Located in the plaza on the corner of Route 2A and Route 27.
Version 6.2 2012-07-11 3
It would be helpful if there were a map option that showed your choice of all area hotels, restaurants or parks/attractions of a city (or all) so we would be able to zoom in and have an easy way to compare locations.  Often when we travel we know we want to be near certain attractions but dont know the exact address.  A map allowing hotel, restaurant and attractions to be overlaid would be an incredible help not just in planning but while visiting the city!  How about it ?!
Version 8.0 2013-10-08 3
The latest version has an intermittent bug. I typed a complete review and then clicked the submit button. The button flashed and that was it. The app never accepted the review. There is no error message, and everything else seems to work. I clicked Add Photo and added one to the review that was never accepted, and it appears to have accepted the photo without the review, which is still visible. I even received an email thanking me for the photo but did not receive one for the review. I guess I'll reboot the app and try again.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-09 5
This thing could put a lot of tour guides out of work, but we have found it so useful on our trip through Italy. Last night in Rome we were a little lost on way to restaurant, we turned it on and it guided us there by foot! Combine that with all the info, the tours, (that can be downloaded to your phone so you don't use cell data) and this thing can really enhance a vacation.
Version 5.92 2012-02-02 5
I will not go anywhere unfamiliar without checking with trip advisor. People's reviews give the perfect referrals, much better to have someones opinion then going to a place blind. Even the best hotels have bad reviews, so it's nice to shop around.  It's also great for searching out new restaurants, site seeing and vacation get-always. I have to thank Andy for sharing this site with me!
Version 5.7 2011-08-07 4
The Title sums it up. Touch interface on the actual maps.  Lots of supporting information. Would be great if it had an integrated interactive Question and Answer option. Something that would let me ask random travel related questions, and in the background search Google, facebook, twitter, the "blogosphere", etc.  Then, collect and arrange the results by source, but still allow me to rearrange them at will.
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 4
I love this app for checking and writing reviews. The only problem is that I have noticed a few times that the reviews don't always match the restaurant that is being reviewed. This is usually only the case with bad reviews. (probably cheap Europeans looking for the cheapest place to sit all night and not tip). Trip advisor should always make sure that the review has been written specifically for the business listed so no one is slandered wrongfully.
Version 6.6 2013-02-17 5
I have been using trip advisor for a long time. Mainly for use with finding cheap flights but as of lately I have been using it to find local things to do visit parks etc. I absolutely love this app and it is a great tool to just go anywhere and explore the world with. I love nature and new things and trip advisor has never let me down. So thank you Trip Advisor!
Version 5.8 2011-10-23 5
Just heard about this app and used during a weekend getaway to Asheville, NC. Reviews on restaurants, hotels, and things to do were dead-on and liked how it allowed you to search by ratings or by proximity. Also was helpful to be able to map place or call directly from app screen. Will never go without trip advisor again.
Version 5.8 2011-11-19 3
We have used Trip Advisor for finding hotels as we travel by car, and have used it locally in New England and found it to be quite helpful. I tried to rely on it for our trip to Ft Lauderdale and it was surprisingly not relevant to wrong! A restaurant that was highly rated by Trip Advisor in Deerfield beach wasn't even there any more, a highly rated botanical garden in Davie was in a state of disrepair and reeked of urine, a hotel in Boca Raton was sorely stale. Maybe the star ratings need to have a restricted time element?
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-28 5

Version 5.8 2011-09-07 5
I always go to trip advisor first when planning. I have found so many good pieces of advice for places I would never have visited otherwise. Everything I want to know is in one place, and the personal comments are so helpful. I have started to write reviews lately myself, if for no other reason than in gratitude for the help others have given me. Try it and see!
Version 8.5 2014-02-28 5
I absolutely love this website and use it for ALL of my travel.  You can see the actual visitor pictures rather than just what hotel advertises, so you get a true visual of where your money is going.  It's a one stop shop as it also show competitive rates from all the top travel websites, recommend local things to do and what's nearby.  This is a must have!!
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 5
Since discovering Trip advisor Whenever we find ourselves in a new city we are assured of good eating places and fun things to do.  Last year we were in the Big Apple and it was invaluable with helping us to narrow down our choices.  Right now we are in Orange Beach, Alabama and thanks to Trip advisors one meal has been better then the other.  Read the reviews....
Version 8.5 2014-03-27 5
The first thing I do when going to any destination, restaurant or lodging, Trip Advisor is my one and only reliable source. I always read the negative reviews as well as the positive before making a decision. I even got assistance from Trip Advisor readers to get back money from an unscrupulous fishing charter who cheated me on a deposit. Thank you Trip Advisor.
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 4
The website really helped out when planning our trip to Tahoe. Now that we are here I have consulted 4 apps so far to help guide us and this one has been the most helpful and easiest to access what we are looking for. Photos & comments are usually plentiful. Now we just need video and customizable itineraries. A crowd sourced calendar of events wouldn't be a bad idea if the simplicity of the app could be preserved. :)
Version 5.5 2011-05-05 5
On our last visit to Guayaquil, Ecuador my wife & I used for everything, even finding our hotel, things to do and places to visit, we couldn't have done it without your help, and we had a wonderful experience in Guayaquil, Ec now we are planning to go back on the fall but this time, we are going to add the Galapagos Islands, this is what we call the Perfect combination.
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 5
Love this App. Found some restaurants in my town that I didn't even know about and a couple that I thought had closed but just moved. The Things To Do tab gives some really good ideas for a vacation and also just around where you live. This is one of my go to Apps when planning anything from a trip to a date night to a day out with the family.
Version 6.6 2013-02-23 5
We use this app all the time when traveling. We have discovered fabulous restaurants in out of the way locations that we would otherwise have missed and have steered clear of unpleasant choices. Best to use most recent reviews and look at overall score rather than relying on only one very bad or very good review.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-24 5
I use this app to find accommodations and restaurants on all our travels.  It's invaluable to have this wealth of data at my fingertips; making our travel experience all the better as we focus on hotels and restaurants that get great reviews.  I also use this app to write reviews.  I love being able to quickly write a review with my real-time thoughts.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 5
If any of the General Managers or Property Managers would look at the site and see what is being said, they could see things from their guests views. It would help in training, and improvements. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A COMPLAINT ABOUT TWO THINGS!!!!!  #1. Never should there be a complaint about the cleanliness of their room!
#2. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE ANY NEGATIVE REMARKS LEFT ABOUT THE FRONT DESK STAFF! THEY SET THE TONE FOR THE GUESTS STAY! FIRST IMPRESSION................
Version 5.7 2011-08-12 5
Took us from Scotland to Italy to San Antonio TX.  Our son was giving locals advice on where to eat and what to see IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES!!!!!!  Trip Advisor was just great.  got us their and back anywhere,anytime,anyway.  People were curious, so it was it,s own conversation starter.   Traveling with Trip Advisor is just a hoot!  You,re going to love this product.  Even a low tech Grammy can use it.  And I know that how?  I R 1.
Version 5.6 2011-08-23 5
Only drawback noticed so far is, I can't locate the address of restaurants easily - the app shows them on a map, but does not seem to provide an address easily - or maybe I am not looking for the address at the right place. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating.
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 1
As an expat living in Kathmandu, Nepal for 7 years I thought I might be able to find other great places to go or visit or shop at but to my disappointment all the great attractions and places to eat and shopping destinations were not even on the lists! Even the hotels listed weren't even the good hotels but the gheto hotels. Where are they getting their information? I wanted to use this app to find the best places to visit in Delhi, India but I don't trust it. P.S. When I told it to find hotels near me (while sitting in my home in Kathmandu) it came up with hotels in Kenya! Then when I tried to reset it it told me of a hotel that is 16 hour drive from my home. Come on...get your maps strait!
Version 5.93 2012-02-28 5
This is an excellent app. I stumbled upon it while checking out restaurants in New Orleans. My husband & I ate at a terrible restaurant & later read the poor reviews on Trip Advisor. After that experience, we started going onto their website to make sure we weren't going to get ripped off the next time. We used it for hotels & restaurants the rest of the trip & were not disappointed.
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5
Just like the website, the app has a lot of useful information that helps make informed decisions when traveling and looking for  hotel or just looking for a place to eat near home.  The reviews give a lot of real insight and the app is easy to use.  The app crashed a few minutes after I installed it, but I rebooted and have not had a problem since.
Version 6.6 2013-04-07 5
The app, itself gives you access to virtually everything you need to know to plan your trip.  For a particular site, hotel, etc. for which you need to know more, the app has a built-in web browser which takes you to iPad-friendly web sites.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 4
I happened to find Trip Advisor by accident through Facebook. However I am happy I did. It has been helpful when planning my time abroad. The only bad thing I can find is that like any other comment based advice system, you get mixed comments and it can be confusing at times. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know about the things happening in whatever place they are getting ready to visit.
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 5
We use trip advisor for every vacation. We check reviews of every restaurant, hotel, bar, and for things to do when we are going to an area. I use what I call the "90% rule." if 90% of the reviews are positive it's usually a great place. 10% of the population are never happy so they need to vent about it. I have never gone wrong using trip advisor!
Version 8.4 2014-02-06 4
Manatee island grill is a quaint little restaurant on Seaway Drive in Fort Pierce.  We had lunch there and enjoyed all of the food we ordered.

We all had salad which was large. One person has soup.  Our meal came and it was enjoyed.

I gave this a 4 star only because when my salad came there was a long hair on the plate and it wasn't mine.  

One person ordered the fish and chips.  There was more batter than fish.  Everything else was tasty.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 2
You can't scroll very well when your trying to find a hotel, there's no search function that would find the hotel I was staying at and the attractions around and close by. When scrolling  the hotels you would get to the bottom but it would let go on the the next 20 until you tap on a hotel then you could scroll down to the next 20. It has some good photos of every thing when you find it it doesn't perform  well on my iPad it's slow and it hard find what information your looking for if I was to use to book a hotel it might be worth it
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 5
When you travel to the town of Assisi in Italy you must visit the best Wine Bar called Bibendi Assisi. Wonderful service and an experience you will remember for a lifetime. The owner Nila Halun is a beautiful gracious hostess with a vast knowledge of all wines. She also does wonderful local food pairings with her great selection of wines. Great prices and great service. Do not miss this great wine bar.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-02 1
I used to LOVE this app until they ruined it by taking away the "what's nearby" when you're already scrolling down a hotel or a restaurant page.  (Not the one from main menu). That feature is extremely helpful to me especially if I was driving to a hotel I didn't know and I wanted to see for example what restaurants are near that property BEFORE I'm there at the hotel location. Now I can only use the  near by feaure ONLY when I'm actually there at the location. Also, navigating thru app is now cumbersome and not as simple and elegant as before.  Very annoying. May just delete this app and find something else !
Version 6.1 2012-04-05 4
I started using this app when planning for a trip home from Thailand to the U.S. in March 2012. My wife and i stopped in several places on our way to Pittsburgh, Pa. This is really a great one stop way to find cheap airfares and hotels when planning vacays. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because I've only been using the app for a month and I'm not sure of it's usefulness over time but so far, it's been my best travel planning tool.
Version 5.92 2012-02-16 5
I have been using Trip Advisor on their web site for a while as it is a great resource for finding lodging all over the world. However I do get annoyed by the way the different web sites pop up when you hit the get prices button.  This app sets them up in an organized way. There's also a good locator map. I highly recommend this app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 5
Trip Advisor picks up where we used to rely on travel agents (are you old enough to remember travel agents?). I can always filter out the tourist traps and find the gems any destination has to offer, with just a few quick clicks in the mobile app. So easy, we rely on it and have never been disappointed!
Version 6.0 2012-03-24 5
Top Key West Boutique Hotel in downtown Key West, FL with spacious accommodations, clean and classy fixtures, comfortable bed, incredible bell staff willing to get you whatever you need to make your Key west adventure a hotel stay you with memorable moments by the dozen. Sandeep is a wonderful hotelier and knows that great service and cleanliness are next to godliness!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-24 4
I'm using this to plan a vacation to Scotland and so far it has helped quite a bit. This is my first time using it to plan a trip and so far it has helped make planning less complicated. This app is very helpful but I will rate this app based on what it has helped me to do. Ultimately in the end it will be judged on how my trip will go with the use and help of this app. I will update my review once my trip is over.
Version 6.6 2013-01-31 5
I work a hotel myself & always recommend that our guests post on trip advisor. I was browsing looking at our ratings when I found myself browsing other hotels around the country & now I want to travel more just to go to the hotels in my saved list! Very helpful in reviews & I find it better than Yelp! Or any other review website.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-17 5
When you have time for extended reviews OR when you just need to check the favorite local beach in the town you are visiting, TripAdvisor is there for you. My favorite feature: visitor (insider) pictures of hotels I consider booking, instead of shiny catalog pictures of rooms. Very important for a family with kids.
Version 8.2 2013-12-03 5
TripAdvisor is as much a part of my travel plans as my suitcase and change of clothes. I love the ability to search for bargains in travel and lodging, and get the inside baseball on what I can expect from local hotels and restaurants! The iPhone app works flawlessly on my 4S, and it is very helpful to have by my side. TripAdvisor = Five Stars!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 4
I really like trip advisor, it's very helpful in planing a vacation, however it would get 5 stars if I could save my place. I will be on pic 107 of a resort when I put my phone down and when I cone back I have to start at pic 1. I don't want to keep seeing the same 100 photos because I don't have 5 hours at one sitting to see them all. Same with reviews. Even if they added a search option that would make it better.
Version 8.2 2013-12-15 5
TA has served us well in the planning of trips on four continents. Filter out the petty complaints and triage the rest and the results more often than not match reality.  Some navigation issues remain but overall this is one of our main and most trusted travel sites. And we even use it for info on our home base b
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-01 5
I started using trip advisor when my husband got a traveling job and I occasionally would go with him.  Since then we have been addicted and I've hooked my parents on it too.  Great for finding local gems in restaurants and decent hotels. I love seeing the trip advisor signs when I go into restaurants now.  Everyone can be a critic.
Version 6.6 2013-03-12 5
While visiting in Philippines discovered T.A. while evaluating lodging choices. Then discovered all the related features which included rich info on local eateries and things to see and do. Yelp included nothing in the Philippines. It's the strong international contribution by the users (like me) that make this App really good. It won a place on my home page.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
Going to Barbados again and just wanted to see what the site listed. 
Everything I know about the island was there plus the reviews and advice from travelers very helpful. Can't say enough. I must have application. Also I live in NYC and I found so many great things to do. Plus price how long the activities and location direction. You won't regret it.
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
TripAdvisor provides up to date reviews from actual travelers spending their hard earned cash so their opinions can be trusted more than any hotel website - the key is for users to follow suit with their own reviews to keep the database current; the reviewer photos are often more true to life than the photoshopped   professional ones
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-29 5
We dine out weekly in the Orlando/Winter Park are, and travel the US monthly, often stopping in towns we haven't visited before. This is our must-have app for checking out restaurants, cafes, hotels, attractions. Thank you to all the folks that add reviews regularly. You've never let us down!
Version 5.5 2011-04-30 5

Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Gives the most detailed info about any given hotel! I've been planning a trip to California & these other websites never really give much info. You can see photos from other users who have stayed at a particular hotel & there are far more reviews! I like the impartiality of the app. The reviews are uncut & so are the photos! I highly recommend this awesome app!
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 5
Very dependable and useful app. The negative reviews are as interesting as the positive ones. Some people it seems are unhappy about the most insignificant things.... like shampoo in a plastic bottle that is hard to squeeze out!  The positive reviews are " right on" for us and have helped a great deal in our domestic and European travels. You have earned your stars!
Version 8.0.1 2013-11-09 5
What more could you ask for?  You want to know how good the food is or if the beds are comfy??  Trip Advisor lets you hear it straight from those who have experienced it for themselves and allows you the traveler to tell it just how you see it.   Short of walking around asking people yourself,  there is nothing better.
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
My husband and I travel quite a bit and we don't do anything without checking trip advisor first.  From hotels to restaurants, this app is our go to for everything.  I really love how it can use our location to give suggestions and locales near us.  We have found some real gems we would have never found without this app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-10 3
I love tripadvisor in general and I like the feature to find stuff near me. But the search can definitely be improved. I was looking for a restaurant that was listed to TA with the exact name that it was listed under and it wouldn't come up. I had to search by area and took time to find. Also the responsiveness of the app is not good at times. Finally I can see a description on a specific restaurant on my iPhone app but I could not see that on the iPad app.
Version 6.6 2012-10-14 5
We have been big fans of tripadvisor ever since we returned from a vacation, discovered tripadvisor, looked up the hotel we had just visited, and found that the reviews described the place perfectly!

We have used it for everything from 10 day international vacations down to reviews of a local pub and have not been disappointed.
Version 5.7 2011-09-03 5
Besides being a travel agent I am a frequent traveler, and Tripadvisor has been a great tool to find all travel related places, hotels and sites anywhere I go. A careful reading has given me incredible findings I never expected, but most of all has helped me to give a better advise to my clients.   Bravo for all the readers and writers that has made this website a leader in travel.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
Don't leave home without a review! Travel advisor is usually spot on. Travel for my job into different cities around the country weekly. I come here first. The reviews are very helpful and usually spot on. I have found great places to eat I might have never tried if I hadn't read it here first and I depend on the up to date hotel reviews to pick what's best for me and my needs.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
This app is so great. You can look up various restaurants in an area when you're out of town and hear what others have experienced. You can often spot a recurrent theme in reviews, "the seafood is great; don't eat the steak!" I find it indispensable. It's also fun to share your own experiences to help make the program even more effective.
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
Every year we travel the country. Trip Advisor has never let us down. We do our best to contribute as well to reviews. Like any review service beware of the ridiculous bad reviews and overly zealous great reviews. This app makes it easy to find everything in your area or scout ahead of time. Using it right now to plot our long weekend in Lake Delton!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 3
I love love love the website and think their service is tremendously valuable. I am also a constant contributor. But why on earth have your app ask you to contribute to Facebook on your behalf? In this day and age there is a way to have Facebook integration - a balance of access and rights - that gives a company what they need without asking so much from your customers.  That is just too much an shows their approach is either outdated or misinformed.
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 4
Not so good in other areas. As a regular TripAdvisor contributor I would really like to be able to see my contribution and other account information. It would also be nice if the app would alert me to any hotel responses or helpful votes. The website doesn't do this, but I don't really want an email for each helpful vote, but a nice pop up alert would be nice. 
But for trip planning and travel research this app is great.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 5
Tripadvisor is the first and foremost integrated travel application to use for flight, hotel, reviews, and local attractions. Even if you use other travel sites to search prices, Tripadvisor has better user photos and reviews than Kayak, or Travelocity. 

Highly recommended as one of the app needed on your smartphone or tablet.
Version 6.6 2012-10-05 3
I have used Trip Advisor app for several years, and find the latest version more user unfriendly than the previous versions.  It sometimes fails to draw the map  when going to see where points of interest are located.  it also fails to respond to user selections, ignoring my selections.  Most annoying, however, is that it only does searches based on exact matches, which made it very hard for me to get the information I needed when i only knew part of the information.
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 5
I have come to love this app so much for planning my vacations.  It makes everything easy as far as researching hotels, restaurants, and attractions.  The only downside would be that searching prices is cumbersome since it normally would open new tabs/windows and search various websites.  Still, this is an addictive and awesome app!
Version 5.5 2011-05-28 5
This is by far the best travel  app available.  I had been a huge fan of their website already, and the app is even better.  It's simple to use, with super fast results, and I save every time on flights, lodging, etc. compared to EVERY other travel site there is.  Forget Hotwire,  Travelocity, Expedia, Kayak....ALL you need is TripAdvisor.  I highly recommend this app, great job!*****
Version 5.6 2011-05-18 5
From the planning stages to arrival and throughout our stay in Budapest this app has proven to be most valuable. We found the best possible lodging situation possible thanks to the comprehensive reviews from travelers and saved a considerable amount on airfare also. We will always consult Tripadvisor for any future travel planning!
Version 6.2 2012-07-18 5

Version 5.8 2011-08-30 5
I am so thankful for trip advisor, especially on an iPad. I have been traveling the world for over 1.5 years and really believe it is important to help other travelers whenever possible, not only to tell them where to go for a great experience, but also to save them from the pains of a bad experience. Great app...thank you!
Version 5.8 2011-09-09 5
This app is great for it's ease of use and stability. We used it in three new Towns on our last trip and it really helped narrow down the menu choices. Also compared local places and most reviews are consistent indicating the system is working working. Would love to see a search button so you could jump to a particular restaurant by name though.
Version 5.8 2011-10-27 5
I used to jump back and forth between various websites & apps to "compile" all the info I wanted, but this app has it all (interactive labeled map, hot links, reviews, dine/play, things to see / attractions, etc) and now I only need this one go-to app. And it is very up-to-date as well. Highly recommend for all travel needs, especially to new cities.
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 5
This app is great!  We love using reviews posted by regular folks like us.  People whom the proprietors of hotels, restaurants and other places don't realize will be reviewing their services.  And we love contributing our own reviews.  We've found that proprietors love to hear about how we gave them four or five stars - when we do that ;)
Version 5.9 2011-12-28 4
This app is wonderful. Used it to find some very unique restaurants that I wouldn't have ever tried. The reviews did not steer me wrong. Used the app when I was out traveling when the place we were going to go to didn't seem too great.  Found a different place in seconds and it was wonderful. Sure some areas don't have many reviews especially in rural areas. But the more people use trip advisor and leave reviews the better it's going to get.
Version 5.5 2011-04-28 5
Great app. So helpful especially in an area that is unknown. Just wrapping up a trip on west coast... Enjoyed researching/mapping out the next days activities while relaxing in my hotel. Thought info and pics very accurate as well as navigation. Makes me feel familiar in places I am not familiar with... Also great for searching for specific stores and restaurants and entertainment.
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
This app really gives u travel power. it is simple to use, non-bias, and loaded with info. From up to date reviews on just about any destination, to real people advice on lodging, thinks to do, where to eat, and much more. My favorite part of this app however are the pictures, because they are actual photos from previous visitors!
Version 7.1.1 2014-02-12 5
I love this app.  It's in my top 5 of all apps.  I travel a lot and this helps me remember and 'star' all the places I visit.  When you have a solid week in Paris, London, or wherever and you're seeing things every 5 minutes, it's great to have a reference like this.  I even have my own city downloaded for info and I've been here over a decade.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
Our all time favorite on the island! We have been staying here for over 10 years and we stay a least twice per year. We stay in the cabanas only. It is old, but beautiful ocean views, easy beach access!  Love hanging out at the beach/pool bar eating the perfectly grilled poolside burgers... They are simply delicious!  Just relax, kick back and enjoy!  Fabulous!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
This app is awesome for traveling and finding great places to eat, or things to do when you're someplace unfamiliar. And the 'Near You Now' function is wonderful too! We've used it several times while traveling and it has saved us a bunch of time and money and prevented us from falling into the tourist  traps for meals and activities.
Version 6.6 2013-02-03 5
Well, the reason I bought this app is because one time, me and my family went to New Jersey for my cousins bar mitzvah, and we stayed in a hotel that claimed to be an " airport hotel " . But, sadly, it was just a yucky hotel five or six miles from the airport. Should've read the reviews first.
Version 5.4 2011-04-08 3
Looked at restaurant listings for my own area. While the stated addresses appeared to be correct, the location on the map for several was very wrong. It appears to confuse state and county routes placing some restaurants in the wrong town as much as  30 or 40 miles from the correct location. It also listed a restaurant which has been closed for at least 2 years. It is a nice application but I would certainly confirm the correctness of the data before acting on it. Maybe its better in large cities.
Version 8.3 2013-12-27 2
I submit reviews to remember what places I like and why.  I can not believe that you can not see your reviews on the trip advisor ipad app but rather have to go into the browser! I can not believe more people are not complaining about this or maybe they are silently going off and using other review sites that are more fully features..

Tripadvisor, please improve your feature support!  Please add the capability to see your reviews in your IPAD app!  I will have to move to using another review app until you add this support:-(
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-10 4
I wish it was everywhereadvisor though I would love to get reviews on every business that would be awesome but I count on reviews before I give 9 out 10 places my business. And tripadvisor helps me choose where I take my business with the help of others who write honest reviews. So thanks tripadvisor for helping me plan my destinations for my daily life and where I take my money, time, and family!
Version 5.8 2011-09-11 2
Packed with features you'd expect but they don't work the way you'd expect them to. I was led to enter a specific town so it looked like there was nothing nearby, when really there were other places just outside the town. It's all in the naming. But the maps system doesn't make it easy to find places at a regional level. Once I found a few places, I used the save feature to remember them, but the next time I opened the app my save list was empty... So evidently it only saves for one session or something. Very frustrating. So much potential.
Version 6.2 2012-06-13 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-18 5
This is my favorite app and before that it was my favorite website. Incredibly easy to use and informative. First place I look when I'm thinking about traveling and usually I don't have to look anyplace else for the info indeed. I trust this the info on this app completely and also trust the reviews that travelers post too. Solid 5 stars.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 4
It was a big surprise when I first started using this app. It is much faster to find a hotel using this app, the only con for me is the fact that the app do not maintain your navigation when you leave it and return. E.g. I set a lot of filter options (price range, hotel star rate, etc), and if I have to leave the app for any reason, when i come back I have lost all settings and must do all over again.
Version 5.9 2012-01-06 5
Well, I got TripAdvisor because I saw my hubby using it and I was jealous.  And I was right to be!  It's great. I'm living in southern France and traveling to Den Haag in March for said hubby's next birthday....and I'm planning the whole trip thru TripAdvisor.  Plus, if you have a bad or wonderful experience somewhere, you can literally tell the whole world. Love that.
Version 6.2 2012-06-19 5
Trip Advisor has been my go to guide for travels over the past few years. Spend some time reading all the reviews and then make your decision. Also know that different people have different ideas and needs in mind about their travels.  I do not leave home for a vacation without checking it out on Trip Advisor first.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
As an operations manager at a destination hotel and suites this app is great for seeing how my guests loved their stay or hated it. I love outing up reviews for my neighboring restaurants and hotels to help improve their business as well. My hotel recently moved up on our trip advisor rankings! Thanks for being there so I can hear what my guests likes and dislikes are!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 5
Great app to use when finding hotels, Resturaunt and things to do.  Learning from other people with and current experience is great.  It also gives many different perspectives so you can get a more complete view.   You can learn about what you care about and also learn what you may not think to ask about.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Ok I love diversity in different parts of the world,so I like people opinion and reviews I am so glad Trip Advisor answer all my question and needs. I give this application a 5 star. I also am a review giver too. I like people to see my honest  opinions o they can see what they need. Trip Advisor keep up the good work. 

Thanks

Version 5.5 2011-04-17 3
This is an interesting app because it includes more than the usual bunch of hotels,  check the reviews carefully... Even the genuinely worst (& I mean hideous, bedbugs & all) manage to get plugged w some hillariously great feedback. But the app likes to bug you constantly with push notifications much in the same way this same organization likes to bug you with stupid emails if you have an account with them. That is unfortunate as it makes an interesting app seem more like junk.
Version 6.6 2012-12-07 5
I always read reviews of places/hotels/activities before booking anything. It always helps in making decisions where to stay, what to do and what to expect. While reviews are different from one person to another and depends on experience also, Tripadvisor is still my go to app/site. Very useful for travelers.
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
We use Trip Advisor to check out lodging and restaurants and find the reviews very reliable.  Aside from the occasional person with an ax to grind, I find the reviews right on the money though I always check the dat written.  It seems things can change pretty quickly for the better or worse in the hospitality industry.
Version 4.1 2011-08-12 5
love anything that is both easy and " i padddy" smiling 
easy to review. however, when i want to upload  images ,i must go to my pc. life!
good job. you guys are my kind of mind type people! 
just love sharing my reviews on your site ! but 
most of all i dont go anywhere before i look the place up on your site,
nava writz
Version 5.8 2011-08-11 4
When creating reviews, the App needs a lot of work.  The editor window had no facilitites for scrolling up/down to make changes.  Also, the on-line entry provides other capabilities such as preview and requiring information such as last-time-visited.

For finding places it works great.  I will limit my use to that until updates come along that improve the creation of reviews.
Version 6.6 2012-12-30 5
I like the hotel interface a lot.  It's very intuitive, and it presents options quickly, in an easy to understand format.  I like that the list changes as you pan or zoom the map, and I like that I can look at the hotel websites directly from TripAdvisor.  I'm about to play with flights, and I think I'll like that equally.  Good job!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-06 4
I love TripAdvisor. When traveling for business, I often use it to find nearby restaurants.  My only complaint is that the filter feature is not very flexible. For instance, when sorting on price, you can't choose $$ or less - it'll only give you the restaurants that are exactly $$, necessitating multiple searches.  
Other than the filter, great app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-18 5
Because it would have reviews of the Restaraunts and hotels on said desert island. 
Because the mother website has such a treasure trove of globe-spanning reviews, this app is a necessity for travelers. 
Try to be better than I am about putting reviews back into tripadvisor-pay it forward!
This app makes the data easy to access. Nice job.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-22 5
Love trip advisor. I use it every time I'm out of time for restaurants and have never gone wrong. I have tried other food apps and they are not even close to being as accurate. A plus is the fact they don't mess with rating fast food restaurants. Who needs a star rating for a McDonalds, Burger King, etc.?  Also very good for finding a good hotel.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
This is my #1 resource for planning and executing trips with my wife. We love to know what we are getting into when we go places, and also love that we can organize and explore potential options through the app when we are in new places. It makes it easy to be more adventurous, and the reviews are almost always spot on.
Version 3.0 2009-07-27 3
For a free app, I certainly can't complain. It definitely gives you a list of nearby restaurants and links you to Google maps so you can find them. To test I put in the location where I currently live (urban) and where I grew up (very rural) and the lists were accurate. The ratings, however, were almost all four stars, and not at all how I would rate them. I think it will improve as more people use it. Urban Spoon beats the heck out of it although I don't think that one is free.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 4
I always write reviews with this app instead of Urbanspoon or Opentable but since I travel a lot I found one major flaw in the program.  There is no easy way to add new places. I understand TA wants to verify the authenticity of all places but there should be a trust threshold that can be based off the number of reviews written or something since they already have the star system in place.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-18 5
I find this app one that I use whether I am at home looking for a restaurant that I have not tried or to make recommendations for friends planning on visiting the area.  It is quick and easy and having it on both the iPad and iPhone makes it a snap to use.  If you are a traveler or just a homebody this app is very helpful.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-05 1
I've never had a problem before, but the most recent version keeps crashing on my 1G iPad before opening.   The app is not much use to me now.

UPDATE:   I uninstalled the version of Tripadvisor on my iPad and reinstalled the app.   Same problem.  The app does not load.  A screen comes up and the app then crashes.

SECOND UPDATE:  the newer app, the fix, now works with iOS5.  I don't like the app.  It is not obvious how to write a review.  Once you figure that out, the app does not let you rate, price, value, service, etc as you can using the website. This app is as disappointing as the restaurant that I just rated.
Version 5.3 2011-02-01 4
Because it draws from the popular and fabulous Tripadvisor website, it has a lot of hotels, restaurants and attractions in its review database. The "find nearby" feature was VERY useful to us when we needed to find a late night stopover hotel on a road trip. It tells you how far away the nearest hotel or restaurant is, and the direction (SE, NW, etc.). The mapping feature didn't seem to work well, though. Keep improving it.
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 5
Me and my wife went to New Orleans on our anniversary and glad we used it wished we had the app before we left. Due to the bad experience we had first night in a bad restaurant we knew it would be useful and is so far very helpful, thanks trip advisor and all that has joined this is one of the most useful apps on my iPhone.
Version 6.6 2012-11-01 5
I've been a member of TripAdvisor for years now and I find this app to be especially helpful. I've reviewed everything from truck stop restaurants and hotels to museums and amusement/theme parks. Unfortunately, there are those reviewers that rent a two or three star hotel room and expect it to be a five star hotel.
Version 6.4 2012-09-09 4
This app has all the tripadvisor basics. 

While one can add new reviews of restaurants, etc., one can *not* rate traveler reviews. Review are a key Tripadvisor feature. To avoid planted reviews it's important to be able to find reviews that are deemed most helpful by readers. As this iPad app usage increases, this capability is deprecated for both iPad and browser tripadvisor users.
Version 6.2 2012-07-05 4
Not finding four out of four very established and long term restaurants in Toronto seems more than slightly lame. Really, the Coffee Tree has been in Bloor West Village for more than 20 years and has a phenomenal reputation but its not in Trip Advisor? I've done a lot of reviews and use this  application lots, but this is the most frustrating bit of stupidity I've encountered in a long time.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Greatest trip app ever.   I have used it for years and years.  It always hits the mark as far as correct information goes.   We use it for International travel as well as stateside.   Trip Adviser steered us to the Casablanca hotel in N.Y. City.  We stay there whenever we go to the city.   Actually, from B&B's in Sonama to Hawaii to San Fran. We take this app every where we go.
Version 5.5 2011-04-26 4
Trip Advisor works just like the web site with reviews and help finding restaurants and hotels, but it could be better. 
The app will sometime provide telephone contacts for the hotel but in most cases just provides a link to Expedia or
Orbitz. The same thing happens when you click on Check Rates. It would be better if it would link you to the hotel
website or at least provide a local phone for the hotel.
Version 6.6 2013-01-23 5
Jennifer and G were amazing!  Food was delicious!  Atmosphere Naplease! Service by Jennifer  delivered was helpful and great suggestions we enjoyed!  G, the manager checked on us and made sure everything was perfect with a genuine and sincere and kind manner!  Overall, 5 stars!  A definite remember!! Thanks to both for a lovely dining experience!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-19 5
Love the app- have used it globally and have found some gems as a result. I regularly use the "saved" feature when I hit upon a place I'd like to revisit, but an enhanced feature would allow me to make a note to myself about a particular room I stayed in or dish I enjoyed. Is this a feature in an upcoming release?
Version 5.93 2012-03-04 5
My husband, friend, and I enjoyed a wonderful, informative walking tour led by Franco. The tour lasted four hours, with many breaks along the way...in fact the tour was ended before we realized the time! I highly recommend this tour. Franco did such a great job; he leads tours at 10:00 am, except Thursday when he does the afternoon one. Great experience!
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 5
I'm hooked.  Great way to plan a really good getaway, excursions and special evenings. You get the good and the bad ratings all in one place along with visitors' photos and even maps to help you find your way around someplace new.  Use it and give feedback based on your own experiences to make it better for everyone!
Version 6.5 2012-09-16 5
Has info on every restaurant and hotel I've ever inquired about. I like the personal takes of the wide variety of reviewers. This app has pointed me in the right direction many times and has saved me many unpleasantries. When I ignored it's advice at a restaurant in Macon GA, BOY WAS I SORRY!  It was like dining on vinegar. Obey your fellow reviewers. :)
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
This app easily became a favorite! It's Easier to use than the web site! I found it while on vacation in a small town that google doesn't even seem to know much about and it gave me so much information!!! I originally got the app trying to learn about the surrounding area but it even showed me places I didn't know about here! Simply perfect!!!!
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 5
What a great find. 
Trip Advisor saved the day for us while on vacation and found for us (through their reviews) a great restaurant after a long difficult day of driving. Made all the difference to end on a high note and we would never have found that restaurant without Trip Advisor. 
We will be using it throughout the rest of this trip!
Version 6.6 2012-11-15 4
Nice app for when you're on the go.  But there is very limited access to your own profile and prior reviews.  If you mistype or forget to upload a picture with your review you can't get back to it from the iPad app.  But for routine searching it works very well.  TripAdvisor should upgrade this app to give it the full functionality of the website.
Version 5.4 2012-04-24 5
I live by this app once I'm more than 50 miles from home. I travel plenty and this has been much easier than trying the Trip Advisor site from my phone.  The biggest help (available on the web too) is the find restaurants near me function.  I sometimes write reviews from this and that was easier on my iPad than my iPhone. Otherwise, great.
Version 7.0 2013-05-03 5
The app is responsive and easy to use but probably can be made better in many places. But the trip advisor content is amazing so this is 5 stars. I've traveled to a lot of places where the trip advisor rating sticker is almost as common as yelp on restaurants in the US. It's my go to source for travel information.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-21 1
Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Trip Advisor. I am however very disappointed in the app. It's very laggy, and crashes every single time I try to scroll through any pictures. It goes to a black screen and just stays at that black screen until I turn my phone off and on. I use the app to read the reviews and scroll through a few photos, so it is very aggravating. Overall the app lags constantly, and crashes often. I am holding out on deleting the app in hopes of an update that fixes all the problems, but until then I'll be sticking to the website version of Trip Advisor.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-06 5
This software helped us a lot while in L.A.  We did a lot of Internet searches on attractions and then finally discovered this app.  From then on we just used the app and the user postings and ratings of attractions helped us to decide which to visit.  Users posted pictures which helped too. Highly recommend this app.
Version 5.6 2011-07-06 4
I LOVE LOVE LOVE using trip advisor for hotel reviews and finding things to do in the area I'm traveling.  It's one thing for a hotel to write a description of their location and services, it's another thing to hear first hand from other travelers about their stay.  I've avoided certain places and I've selected others based on reviews.  With so much competition out there, good customer service and value are important to all types of travelers.
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 5
The web browser version of Trip Advisor is quite handy, and I have used it quite a bit, but I think this iPad version may be even nicer.  Well worth downloading for the would-be traveler!  Also take a look at the iPad version of Kayak, which I have found to be a great program for choosing flights.
Version 8.3 2013-12-24 5
I have used this app to travel around Texas and Louisiana. I have found excellent places to eat, stay and visit. Also it has caused managers to address problems I've identified. I will continue to use this app for planning purposes, assuming they maintain the high quality, the remainder of my traveling days.
Version 5.5 2011-06-01 5
Lovely app to read the reviews and look at photos of hotels and restaurants before you actually decide to go their yourself. Plus you can share your own experience as well informing others. A very good online community of dedicated and involved users means that their will be many more reviews to come. Something all travelers should have =)
Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5
I've been using the TripAdvisor website for over five years to help me find good lodging on our family trips. I was hesitant to use their app (some apps just don't do justice to what the websites do). This one does MORE than justice - I only needed a couple hours and I'm hooked! It even has a built in web-browser. Awesome travel app for TripAdvisor!!!
Version 6.6 2012-12-22 5
We used this app to plan a family vacation to Italy. Super helpful reviews from people and not the usual whining from grumps. These been-there-done-that reviews guided us without fail on that trip. Now I'm off learning about SW US as I plan a trip from the passenger seat of my car. Love the flexibility of doing this research at home or on the go.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-01 5
I have been using trip advisor for our scuba diving business "Blue Life" in the Riviera Maya, and it has help us grow tremendously. It creates awareness and belief amongst travelers. 
I have also used trip advisor as a traveler and it has helped getting the best quality of our trips! 
I simply just love it!
Version 8.2 2013-12-05 3
For hotels, how come you can't sort by distance or price anymore?  "Sort" and "Filter" features are exactly the same when they should be different functions.  For instance, you should be able to filter out hotels that don't have a swimming pool, and then sort them by distance to the city center. Was a really helpful feature in past versions and, without these functions, makes the app much less useful for planning purposes.
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
Gives you tons of information very quickly. Truly indispensable for a trip.

One minor complaint, though: when searching for a hotel, there should be more filter options (e.g., by star rating). Currently you can filter only by price-and very poorly (searching for a price range would be a nice improvement).
Version 6.3 2012-07-20 5
I use Tripadvisor for all my traveling needs especially when I have to compare hotel prices and read reviews.   This app works well on my iPhone and iPad as well, great job.  There are some quirks that I've encountered, but since I can't really remember them, I'm suspecting it's not a big deal.
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 4
The reviews are so helpful but I learned the hard way not to trust the maps on trip advisor.  While in Barcelona, trip advisor had the correct address for La Forquilla, a restaurant, but listed it in La Rambla.  This lovely restaurant is NOT in La Rambla.  We almost missed our reservation for dinner because we were looking at trip advisors map.  I learned not to rely of TA for their maps, just their helpful reviews.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-02 5
Very handy for road trips. Everything at your fingertips. GPS locates your position and tells you what's nearby. I just don't understand the rating system. How does a place with maybe 30 total reviews most of them excellent rate higher than a place with 600 reviews most of them also excellent??
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 1
The app works fine but I find the reviews to be suspect. I travel all over and live in a few places and my opinion is that Trip Advisor reviews are filled with fraud. Otherwise, true dumps wouldn't be as highly rated as they are. Also, great and successful places tend to come in low. I believe competitors use the site as a weapon and post fraudulent reviews rather than improve their own business standards. Which means that it's recommendations (and therefore the app) are worthless. I complained to them about this but they seem content to publish the garbage they do and treat complaints about fraud as a personal insult.
Version 6.5 2012-10-29 5
Whether you primarily travel domestically or internationally trip advisor os the perfect app for community based information.  Should it be a hotel or restraunt u can always get the inside scoop and scout out your next moves as long as u have wifi...absolutely love it and use it all the time on my travels
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-20 1
My friend and I went in for burgers. The menu lists the burger with cheddar, bacon and avocado. We order two. It takes 20 minutes from when we put the Oder in and we didn't see the waitress during that time. When we finally get the burgers they are smothered in blue cheese. We ask if the mistake was ours. She says no and that she'll mention to the owner that she should put the change in the menu. We tell her we hate blue cheese and she gave us the full bill.  I've tried this place before because my husband keeps saying it's good... My experience is if you drink a lot it's good otherwise go elsewhere!
Version 6.1 2012-05-21 3
I want to love this app - it has great info, and looks gorgeous. 

Unfortunately it's riddled with bugs. It constantly loses your place in lists; the feature to save starred attractions is worthless because half the items saved to lists don't work; frequently panes don't update as you tap in different locations, etc. 

I'd recommend people keep an eye on it, because when the bugs are fixed it will be a spectacular app. But right now, we are a long way from that.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 3
The app is great. It makes travel info and user reviews accessible within few taps.  I like it better than the full web site. The only flaw is the map feature, or a lack thereof. I guess I'm spoiled by Yelp! which has a tight in-app map integration.  TA's map feature does work, but mobile apps are not about whether they work, but about convenience and accessibility they bring in spite of limited user interface capability available.
Version 6.1 2012-04-24 5
We never travel without Trip Advisor and have planned with the many comments that are available. I don't use a travel agent anymore because I do better following Trip Advisor.  You can find anything you wasn't with an easy site search. I follow the majority comments, especially for dining and hotels.

Thanks for a great travel tool.
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5
I have used trip advisor for 7 years and love it!  I have posted many reviews and they have been viewed a lot. I recommend it highly.  Be sure to read as many reviews as you can and weigh them.  Different strokes for different folks..so be open to new experiences when you travel with trip advisor..
Version 6.6 2012-12-18 4
The food in this little place is the healthiest and most creative options I've seen during our 5 week trip in India!  The owner (who speaks very good English btw) is very passionate about his (veg only) recipes which is great to see. although the view is not as stunning as other places in udaipur and the service wasn't as speedy as we're used to it was our favorite meal in India so far!!! Must go! :)
Version 8.4 2014-02-01 5
Been using Trip Advisor for a year now and I love the website. App seems just as good. We've used it for hotels, restaurants, and places to visit. As a recently retired traveler I appreciate this site/app and never leave home without it. Also been using it to find restaurants in our home town that aren't our Ursula's.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-24 4
Easier to navigate now but still difficult to know when you've added photos to your written review; also difficult to determine when to submit both as one package.

However, Tripadvisor has a good sized database and it fulfills an important role as a mouthpiece for those of us wishing to warn others of badly-run retail businesses (or send accolades to well-run businesses).
Version 5.7 2011-07-06 5
I am NOT one to ever write reviews about a product/app, its a waste of time, but enjoy reading what others post. Writing this review is totally worth my time. I've only had this app a week and have already saved $100 on my trip by comparing hotels prices in different cities along my trip. The app is easy to use and I LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!! I hope you enjoy the app as much a I do :)
Version 5.92 2012-01-25 5
My wife and I just got back from a 5 day vacation in Pismo Beach and Monterey. All hotels and restaurants were picked based on TripAdvisor reviews. Every hotel and restaurant was incredible. It was one of our favorite vacations. We will be using TripAdvisor for planning all of our vacations from now on and even picking new local restaurants.
Version 5.7 2011-07-05 5
We travel a lot and this app makes it easier.  Sometimes you have to wade through some cranky reviews, but that's true on any site.  The map in addition to the star rating makes finding the best places closest to you a breeze.  I still compare other sites, but this is always my go to app.  It works great on both my phone and my iPad.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 5
Traveling south each fall we use this app before we decide where to stop and we have never been led wrong. We also check for restaurants as we prepare to pull in for the night. Saves wasting time and money and much more accurate than asking for recommendations at the front desks!
Version 8.5 2014-03-22 5
This is a great app! I use it all the time. The users give honest opinions, good and bad that can help your planning easier and your trip more enjoyable. It has led us to some sights we would have never thought about and some places to eat we would have missed. The more I use the app the more I depend on it for planning a trip.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-15 4
I love this App on my iPhone.  You need to get the iPad App up to the same standards to include the same views and filtering options.    I have to go to my iPhone to see B &B's or filter by categories within restaurants and things to do.  Also, when reviewing I can rate different categories on the iPhone instead of just an overall rating on the iPad.  Please update the iPad App version!!!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-25 5
I explored on all travel sites available while planning for a trip to Puerto Rico lately. Ended up getting the most valuable informations from tripadvisor on where to go, where to stay and where to dine. Everybody in my small travel group is happy. Would definitely recommend this site to friends.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 4
Useful app to find things in an area.  I like the map tool a lot because you can move around an area to see what is there and get a feel for it before you get there.  Only beef is that the save feature doesn't always let you expand your area easily from the specific town you're in - it hesitates for a while before figuring out that you want to include saves from a larger area into the view.
Version 5.7 2011-07-08 5
We found this app to be very helpful and user friendly. We decided to take our time going back home through 4 states. Since we hadn't mapped anything out, the Trip Advisor proved to be very useful. We mapped out 4 stops, paid for two on-line, read helpful reviews, and obtained step by step driving directions.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
Trip advisor is a useful tool and valuable resource for people who are too busy to research every detail of a trip for themselves. I have used it to discover restaurants I might have otherwise missed and will always use it from now on to look into possible accommodations when planning business travel.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 1
We travel a lot and always use TA.  The main web site that is.  We HATE this app because all it does is drive traffic to your paying sponsors.  Your main site is still wonderful but we have difficulty finding it when using our Ipad...this darn app keeps popping up.  And what's most aggravating is when I finally manage to find your main site, that we love, and bookmark it...guess what?  When we hit the bookmark, expecting the main site, this crazy app appears instead!  What are you guys doing?   Fix it so that if someone bookmarks the main site we can avoid this useless app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-31 4
Given that most places have a fair amount of reviews the app makes it very easy to get a good idea of what's good and what isn't. We first used it last year when we went to St. Thomas for a week and had great dinners every night. I still use it, even locally, mainly for restaurants and the Advisor community is usually spot on. The app itself is easy to use (I use it mostly on the iPad) and a good tool.
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
This is a great app. One-stop shop for everything you need to travel well. Thorough & user-friendly. I planned my dream trip to Bali from beginning to end :-) The pictures are beautiful and the ratings/reviews from other people who have traveled are very real and helpful. So glad I got this! That sounded like a commercial...lol! But it's true!
Version 6.6 2013-02-03 2
Two major annoyances 1) set the app to use my current location then enter a search term and it zooms out to the entire world! Why the f would I want to know about an attraction in Germany when I am looking for something on the other side of the planet near my current location?!  2) after zooming in back to where I actually am and picking something out to see more information the "back to map" button goes back to a blank page.  The map refuses to re load forcing one to start completely over again. Other than that, terrific.
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 5
Please go back to the old version.  All this does is pull up hotels.  We use to be able to see houses and small cottages to rent.  For example, when I search in Turks and caicos for hotels, I no longer see the Blue Horizon resort in middle Caicos.  Please fix this and go back!  This was one of my favorite apps until you changed it.
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 3
This was one of my first apps and I've always used it for travel & research. I'd be at a loss without it. In my opinion, the user-interface is better than the website. But it seems to be having growing pains. After I installed the new OS it would often freeze. It just had an update & is working much better & offers new features but it seems to be missing original ones. Where is the button for other hotels & how can you see the whole hotel list? Please stop changing.
Version 5.5 2011-04-28 5
I downloaded numerous travel apps for my trip to ireland and none were better than trip advisor.  What makes so good is that it shows you places by closeness.  Some other apps show you places or activities in order of rating and they could be very far away.  I much prefer this trip advisor app to the places app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 3
The 'sort +filter' option needs obviously more filters just like in the full site. Also, when clicking on "full site" option, it doesn't take you to the full site at all but the mobile version; please fix. 

In overall, the app is not bad but I'm not crazy about it, I find myself quitting the app and going to the desktop site on my computer instead for the lack of filters and several of the many options on the desktop site.
Version 6.0 2013-08-04 5
TripAdvisor is the best place to obtain information on hotels, air, dining, and other
Needed facts from real people who have traveled to a destination. The forums offer
So much information when planning a vacation or a day trip. Plenty of pictures help
people see what an area will be like! just the best source for travelers!
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 5
What can be better than unbiased reviews from travelers like you and I?  Tripadvisor provides a forum for comments both positive and negative and by weighing them out an informed choice may be decided upon.  I select most of my travel plans based upon what my peers have to report.  Keep up the great work!
Version 6.1 2012-05-02 4
App seems quite stable and allowed searching of things to do and hotels very well.  The ability to read reviews and see photos worked very well too.  Was hoping to be able to find vacation rentals ....possibly even link directly to FlipKey contact the owner/manager.  I haven't travelled since getting the app so I cant comment on ability to write/submit reviews
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
We often travel out of state and out of the country.  Trip advisor has found us some excellent hotels and excellent restaurants that we would not have tried if left to our own abilities.  Whether we are looking for a good burger place, or a good lunch/rest spot, or a great dinner, Trip Advisor has always come through
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
We're travelling the States so we are in a new town every few days. We rely on Trip Advisor to make recommendations for restaurants and activities. It hasn't disappointed us yet! In return, we leave feedback on places we visit too to build on what's already offered. 
Fabulous app. Literally couldn't do without it!
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 5
Save yourself headaches and wasted time by always checking the reviews here first. Hotels, restaurants, venues, the whole gamut can be examined. You are then armed with knowledge that can be used to make informed decisions. I'd feel totally helpless without my "trip advisor", Tripadvisor.
Version 5.92 2012-01-18 5
I downloaded the APP just in time for my trip to South Beach for work. Was going solo and had never been to South Beach and thanks to the app, I easily found some great restaurants, the best beach spots, and local bars. I would be completely lost without this APP. It really is a thing of brilliance and a MUST for any travelers.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-27 5

Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 4
We spend about eight months a year traveling in our camper/trailer and our pick up. We use trip advisor every chance we get, not only for campgrounds, but for restaurants and activities in the areas we are going to. Trip adviser is also very helpful in finding out about our national parks and monuments, and other areas to see as we travel. Highly recommended!
Version 5.8 2011-09-07 5
Love trip advisor! Couldn't travel without it, the reviews are so helpful, knowing what others have experienced has helped me avoid some pitfalls during my own planning. Also, I love the tips and suggestions provided by others and the rankings for places to go, eat and things to do. I love Trip Advisor.
Version 5.8 2011-09-29 4
Love trip advisor and the app works great too! However sometimes it doesn't recognize other searchable items other than restaurants or hotels or destinations. Like if you want to read reviews on a travel company it's hard to find on the app. But If you're using an iPhone then just looking it up online works. Great app though. You can even save favorites for quick navigation.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
This is not another iPad app I tried this app in Germany,Spain,Kuwait,SriLanka,Dubai and guess what? It works I had a great time this app is very informative and very useful it's a must for all you travelers i went to the coolest places while abroad because of trip advisor many many thanks for this beautiful app! I highly recommend it.
Version 5.8 2011-08-30 5
Check it out. This is the site that has great info about it all! Thanks to all of you who write reviews to help others with their decision making process. It's always nice when you have a point of reference and can compare your experiences with others! Way to go Trip Advisor!!! Continued success!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-29 5
Was losing my patience trying to find the right place to stay for our upcoming 25 anniversary. Thankfully I downloaded the Trip Advisor app and voila, it was a matter of minutes before we found and booked what should be an excitng vacation. Will certainly post our comments upon our return.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-16 5
I use Trip Advisor all the time to check out hotels and restaurants when traveling somewhere. There is nothing like getting user opinions on places to stay or eat. Usually the reviews are spot on and it is a good tool for the hotels and restaurants to improve their service. People like giving their opinion and it helps me make decisions. Great app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-15 5
As the name suggests, Trip advisor keeps us informed with up-to-date information about our travels. It helps us make decisions about our destinations. We are well informed on lodging, food, and entertainment. You can't go wrong with Trip Advisor. That's why we never leave home without their advice!!!!
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
I've been contributing to TripAdvisor for many years now.  It is the first place I check when heading to a new area for information on hotels, restaurants and activities.  The app on my iPad makes it easy for on-the-go reviews.  It is easy to use and quite intuitive in how it works.  No complaints.
Version 6.6 2012-11-28 5
Simply a wonderful tool to find restaurants when visiting places that your not familiar with.  Found several excellent places to eat on my last trip and have begun to use it locally to try some new spots.  Read several reviews because not all experiences are the same.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
I love the Trip Advisor App. My husband and I travel a lot both for business and for fun and I find this App very helpful. I used it for the first time in Hong Kong last February, it gave me great advice on a few excellent restaurants, advice confirmed by the Concierge at the Mandarin Hotel.
I am now relying on Trip Advisor for organizing a trip to Tokyo next September.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
I think this app is amazing! I have account with trip advisor for a lil longer than a year but just got the app for my iPad and I think is great cuz trip advisor give you all the hints that u need to travel and now u can take it with you everywhere with the app! 10+ cuz this is a perfect tool to use when taking decisions about places!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 4
What's not to like? Everything you need to know is all right here in one app - from reviews to prices and comparisons - you can plan your entire getaway without getting a headache. The only reason for not giving five stars is sometimes the app crashes without warning - not a huge deal, but definitely annoying. Overall, a wonderful app that can't be beat!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-26 5
This app allows you to study and plan your prefect trip or vacation. When you have time to sit and plan this app is always available with top notch resources.  Planning your vacation for actives and for the best price and having reviews is a win, win situation. 
Keep up the great work.
Version 5.3 2011-06-05 5
This is a wonderful app, with a serious community of travelers who really take time to explain and make suggestions about sites to visit, places to stay, shop or eat.  For the armchair and aspiring  traveler alike.  My only complaint is that the site is sometimes a pain to navigate.  Presumably they're working on improvements.
Version 5.0.1 2010-09-22 4
The interface could be better organized, but I got a huge amount of use out of this app during a recent three-week road trip around the Great Plains. It's good for pulling into a small or medium-sized town in the evening, identifying the options and their locations, and figuring out what's best. It saved me from a lot of expensive and characterless places near the main road and from a lot of planning ahead.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Trip Advisor is the essential app for vacation planning. My wife and I have relied on the reviews to choose places to stay and those to avoid. We have also discovered activities we would never have found otherwise, such as The Jungle Place in Mexico, where we were able to interact with rescued Spider Monkeys. incredible!
Version 6.4 2012-08-18 5
I travel frequently for business and am always looking for good restaurants.  I have always had good luck with TripAdvisor and trust users' ratings.  Of course, you have to ignore the best and worst reviews like any site!  Easy to use and especially like the overall rankings by location.
Version 6.4 2012-08-22 5
Wonderful location. A convent turned into a Buick hotel, last december.
Big windows from bathrooms, overlooking the forests on the mountains. Nice rooms, French decorations, beautiful.
breakfast cost 12euro on the balcony.
We parked our car in the parking yard that used to be the garden.a great break going from Paris to Italy.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
I travel a lot and in almost every town I go, this app comes in very handy. I have used it all over the US, England and Wales. I have found some incredible food, awesome beers and wines. Thank you to the other travelers that have honestly, objectively given reviews. Highly recommend if you love to travel
Version 6.6 2012-12-03 5
On every trip, whether it be for business or pleasure, I will always consult trip advisor for areas to sightsee, restaurants to eat at and places to go! I trust the opinions of fellow travelers (some more than others!) and on occasion will go out of my way to judge some of those borderline places that get the most reviews! Love the app!!!
Version 6.6 2013-01-14 5
I love reading reviews and writing them on here. It's so nice to read reviews that I know are not paid for by the hotel or restaurant themselves- as many are on other sites. I also love the photos feature. Words can only do some much. Once I see something, all those reviews make much more sense.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-11 5
Tripadvisor is without fail one of the best resources for travel, dining out, entertainment, choosing a hotel etc. The app is easy to use and a nice way to use tripadvisor without using their website. It's fast, easy, and has lots of features that their site does. Love travel- love tripadvisor.
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
I could not live without my trip advisor. We just came back from an incredible trip to Italy and I did it all through trip advisor. The hotels, where to go, places to eat, everything was perfect except I wish I had more time. I am now planing our next trip and now it is even easier.  Thanks trip advisor.
Version 5.9 2011-11-11 5
Whether I'm headed to Columbus, Ohio or St. Martin in the Caribbean, this is without a doubt the best way to link together all the research and information I need. After I've looked at hotels, food, and entertainment, I always go to the forum for the destination, which is always highly active and up-to-date. Highly recommended!
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 1
The Trip Advisor iPad app lacks a lot to be desired for me. It's a better experience on your web browser. On the iPad app you can't hide the left side bar which takes up too much room after you find what you are looking for and you can't enlarge the font or stretch the screen on the app either. The browser experience has way too many pop out windows on Trip Advisor web site. 
Other than the listed items we love Trip Advisor, all the customer reviews are great when visiting a place you haven't been before.
5 stars if you make changes to the above listed items.
Version 5.8 2011-09-06 5
This is a great app. Perfect for planning a trip and easier to navigate back and fourth than the actual website. I was able to check reviews, view photos and then with a quick click go right to local attractions and things to do with reviews on those activities as well. Such a great way to plan trips I love it!
Version 8.0 2013-10-14 1
I can't figure out if the "full rewrite" is just broken or poor design.  The problems for me are all about the location based interface.  Previously you could scroll the map to the direction you were heading and pick up more restaurants and hotels with the new location.  This was very useful if you are driving or walking and looking for a place to eat or stay along your upcoming route.  This feature seems to be broken or removed.  Also, once you are looking at a description, it seems to be difficult or impossible to back up to where you were on the map.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-12 5
This app and Google maps have been all I need to plan our travels to Australia, Key West, Chicago, etc.  The reviews give you a sense for the restaurant or hotel by recent customers.  And the easy access to activity websites, hours of operation and menus makes this our go to app for travel.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
I love trip advisor. I'm a traveling nurse and this is my little travel secret, it's the best app out there for US travel (can't comment on international as I haven't used it for that). The app itself is pretty good. It's easy to navigate and I haven't had any crashes. My only complaint is that I can't use it in portrait mode. I'm not sure why that is, but it annoys the heck out of me!
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
I used this app many times on my recent road trip vacation. We found so many great places to eat, and clean, reasonable places to stay, all right at my fingertips from the road! Excellent app, easy to use and I never would have found so many great places without it! Thank you Trip Advisor!
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 5
Great app. I hate going into a hotel blind. I like the user reviews that give you a real feel for the hotel. I also like that you can add your own photos. You get a better view than just from corporate pics from Grand Opening or as I've found, not even at that location. Great app, use it ALL the time!
Version 8.5 2014-03-07 3
Love the website, and I think the app is beautiful, but I cannot "Add to Trip" from the app like I can from the website.  Odd because I can access "My Saves" from the app, but there is no button for any of the hotels, restaurants, attractions, etc to allow me to save.  Allowing me to keep track of the things I want to do on my particular trip is what I think makes Trip Advisor useful.  Until I can do that the app isn't of much use to me.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 1
The app has always been inferior to the website, but now they seem to be trying to push you to make a reservation just to search.  This is new and very annoying.  You can work around the challenges but overall the app has gotten more prone to send you to a screen you can't get back from.  Trip advisor has been my "go to" sight for years and have seen competitors go away.  The silver lining  is this bad app design and pushing the users where they don't want  to go creates an opportunity for another site to gain a foothold and maybe a new leader by treating users better.
Version 6.5 2012-09-15 4
I'm a rookie at reviewing places but I think this app is very good for commenting on places you've just visited. You can add photos right in the spot as well.  It has also help me find neat restaurants and activities I might have otherwise wouldn't have been able to on my own.

Perhaps finding your buddies reviews would be an improvement.
Version 8.3 2013-12-29 5
I use this app almost daily. I trust the reviews because unlike yelp or some of the other review forums there is this spam like quality where people are just shooting off at the mouth not so on trip advisor. Plus the coolest new feature is adding your Amex card for special benefits and offers
Version 5.5 2011-04-30 5
TripAdvisor has quickly become the go-to app for both planning and executing travel - business of leisure.  Simple, intuitive, and all encompassing.  It even helped diffuse a potential argument between the Mrs. And me while planning a vacation that involved a combination of visiting family and doing some sightseeing.
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
It's great that the app can see where you, if you let it, then show what is good and close by to see, eat, or do.  We found ourselves with a free two hours in Budapest.  This app pointed me to a five star wine museum and tasting experience only five minute's walk from where I sat. We went and had a fun tasting experience.  Thanks!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 2
Very welcomed integration with google maps app. What it is missing now, removed from previous versions is filtering capabilities by distance and ranking (simultaneously). I usually what to find the best options around me, not the fast food joints. So either by stars or by ranking I want to restrict restaurants within a distance. Current filter by price or type is useless to me (let's be honest, price indications are nothing to be trusted). Better filtering capabilities and It would become a 5 star app.
Version 6.6 2012-11-07 5
I think this mobile app is faster and easier to use than the full website version. Yes it is missing some of the search filters and extra tabs, but for what I use Trip Advisor for, reviews, pics, location, and quick prices, those are the main features on this app. It's a time saver.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-25 1
We loved trip advisor until we found that they randomly can remove reviews without explanation.  We have very high ratings & all of a sudden 13 five star reviews disappeared. All from different time periods and reviewers. I contacted trip advisor & they said for privacy purposes, they could not disclose why but it was nothing that our business had done wrong. Due to this our ratings dropped 14 points. People have told us they wrote a review but it never shows up. Trip advisor says it's their standards, but that is a smoke screen. They are pretty much a scam organization.
Version 5.8 2011-08-22 5
The Trip Advisor app is very useful. The multiplicity of comments and reviews along with map locations make it easy to determine a hotels location and proximity to other points of interest.
I find it most helpful particularly if you use a good city map in conjunction with the Trip Advisor map. Thank you Trip Advisor
Version 5.9 2012-01-30 5
I don't keep a ton of apps on my iPad, but this one is an essential. It helps me plan our travels, explore destinations, lodging, things to do and get insights from others who have gone before me.  You could do it on the web, but TA tools and ratings are so helpful. Try it and you will come to rely on it for your travel and planning.
Version 6.2 2012-07-05 5
Tripadvisor is indispensable... and now it's available in an app... wonderful... I even check restaurants here because I find it to be much more reliable than other food rating sites. The app makes reviewing a cinch while on the go... wonderful app & website... THE place to go for the truth, IMO:)
Version 5.6 2011-07-13 5
Late last night while returning from a trip from Yellowstone to our home in CA, our van broke down outside Salt Lake City, Utah in the middle of nowhere.  Luckily, we had signal
And were able to use Trip Advisor to find the nearest town, a towing company, and a hotel.  It knew where we were even when we didn't- What a relief!
Version 6.6 2013-01-19 5
Use this app all the time, but was especially useful for my cross country road trip. Used it to find great but cheap hotels, awesome local favorite restaurants, and the go to attractions and things to do everywhere I went. By far the best app I have. Can't say enough good things about it. Thanks Trip Advisor, you made my road trip awesome!!!!!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-06 5
I've used various Trip Advisor apps for a while (a few years on various and sundry platforms) and have found all of them, including this one, to be very helpful. Are there limitations? Sure, but they can be easily overlooked or worked around by "Mr. Joe Average".

In other words, I like this program.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 5
I love Trip advisor
Whatever you are looking for you will find here
Real reviews from real travelers along with real pictures and not just hotel pics.
If you want the real deal before you take a vacation, this is where you should be before you make your plans.
You will NOT be disappointed!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 5
Recently injured in a car accident, I can't sit at the computer for hours researching information for my up coming trip and was worried I wouldn't be able to gather enough to do the kind of thoroughness I like. This app makes it possible for me to do so on the bus, or lying comfortably in bed. Thanks!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-27 5
Trip advisor has revolutionized our travel experiences.  Savvy businesses see us reviewing and "step up" their services and products (with he exception of ALL Airlines in America -who seem oblivious to any customer feedback). Businesses that ignore the true power of this meta engine do so at their own peril.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
Companies take notice to the reviews made on trip advisor. I'm certain they have improved many of the problems that trip advisor reviewers have voiced complaints about. I also take the time to review the businesses I patron with good juju just to keep the yin and yang thing happy and balanced. Thank you Trip Advisor!
Version 6.2 2012-06-13 5
As frequent travellers, both privately and for business, we use the website for pre-planning and the mobile versions during our trips. They work better now and as long as we have internet access, all is well and we get the information we need smoothly.
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 4
We used this app to find restaurants near us on our last vacation.  It worked perfectly and really helped us narrow down our dining choices and in one case find a good Mexican restaurant we would otherwise have missed completely.  Is it perfect?  No.  I'd love to be able to sort my Saves into folders by location so I have them handy.  But it's a good little free app.  :)
Version 5.4 2011-10-07 5
I trust Trip Advisor. It has real pictures from real customers, not industry hacks paid to fluff up reviews.  I have trusted the information thatTrip Advisor offers for travel to 4 countries (so far) and have felt that I know what to expect before I arrive - invaluable.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
I stayed with my daughter, visited my dad, and met my husband for romantic hotel stay. Trip advisor helped me find good places to eat and visit, with and without my grandchildren. It's also easy to share my experiences with others to help them find places they are more likely to enjoy. I recommend it.
Version 6.4 2012-08-24 5
First time I have used this mobile app, mostly to compare notes on Chicago hotels and restaurants, but I am quite happy with it. I love the power of a computer in my palm and having Trip Advisor a tap away is a trip! Okay, sorry about the pun; it is a valuable tool to me already and I will continue to use it!
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 3
As far as apps go, this is not a bad one. It looks good and seems pretty efficient, but there are some quirky issues from time to time. Like the back button looks out of place and doesn't take you back pages, just moves. Also, it generally uses google maps, but on some pages randomly uses Bing. I'm not even sure the TripAdvisor people know this because the Bing maps don't work at all.

All in all, the app works, but its nothing special.
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 4
Good way to start researching vacation spot. Nice to have saved places. However, after you save, the choice list starts over at the beginning.  It doesn't remember where you left off.  Have to navigate thru list, sometimes several pages. I have had to rescroll thru list 5 times when researching Chicago. Ugh.  Otherwise, very helpful. Thanks!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 4
Love using this when needing to look up stuff for a trip. It has great suggestions and even lists the prices! The only downside is that it requires Internet constantly, which isn't the app's fault. But it makes it harder for me on the go when I don't got wifi on my iPad. The new design is awesome. Yes it's only landscape view, but that allows the user to fully enjoy the various features Tripadvisor.
Version 5.9 2011-10-30 3
As more people submit reviews, it will get better. I found the listings for restaurants where I was staying in Barbados limited. When I searched Near Me from my hotel in Rockley, it listed only 3, leaving out restaurants that wee in the system if searched by name (specifically Tapas was not listed). 

Also, desperately needs feature that lets you read your own reviews. Otherwise, it is hard to confirm that your reviews actually got posted.
Version 5.9 2011-12-21 5
The ability to search around you is awesome because of the fact you don't always know where you are when you travel. All the places listed near me on this trip(ozark mountains AR) were accurate and it helped us not have any dull moments during our trip. App is a must have for any kind of trip
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
It's a great tool to help with hotels in cities where you are not familiar. Planned a trip to Europe and only made one bad hotel choice based on viewer feedback. Several hotels absolutely fabulous; I would never have found them without trip advisor. Thank you to all who provide truthful and candid reviews!
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
I just downloaded this app and im kicking myself for not getting it sooner. It tells me where everything is and where i should go next. Im in Sweden and everything here is in swedish but tripadvisor basically translates everything for me. Some of the prices are a little off for hotels but its cool.
Version 5.7 2011-06-30 5
I relied pretty much on Trip Advisor as my primary tool for setting up a week long New York City vacation.  Using the ratings and reviews, I was able to plan and manage many elements of what turned out to be a great trip - due in large part to Trip Advisor. Thanks - great app.  The "near me now" feature came in handy on a number of occasions too.
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 4
I wish there wasn't a 48 hr delay when you submit reviews until they are posted because that would have saved me from eating at a terrible restaurant. I also think there needs to be better ways of filtering restaurant types because the selectivity of pricing doesn't always work. Other than that it is a very useful app to provide selection of restaurants, hotels, and attractions.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-27 5
Visited "all about you day spa" in pagosa springs Colorado. Pamela, the most wonderful day spa person I have had the pleasure to spend the afternoon with.  Very clean facility, very personal service.  Wonderful!!!! Would recommend to my own mother or my very best friends!!! In fact to anyone!!!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-10 5
Everything you need to know about your trip is right here. I always check the ratings and reviews of real customers which i find very helpful. The site is easy to navigate. If you want to check restaurants nearby, you can easily do so. I check this site before i book for a hotel in most cases
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
This app is definitely the best travel app I have ever used.  It allows me to see what attractions/restaurants are popular and what others are saying about it.  The app even offers web links to attractions if available.  I would definitely recommend this app to my friends!  Thanks trip advisor!  :)
Version 8.5 2014-03-23 5
I have used this many times when traveling. It has not let me down yet. Be sure to weigh excellent vs poor reviews and take into mind some people are never happy. I highly recommend app for anyone traveling both statewide and to Mexico (only things I have used it for)
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 3
I really love this app and gave it a five star. But I have come back to downgrade after the last update that removed the portrait mode. The portrait allowed for easy sharing of information with friends such as itinerary info. Now it is gone. I have been planning a trip to Africa with a friend. When I expand itinerary details I can't even see half of it. So when i print the screen to email, i send incomplete info. I do not really understand why the portrait mode has been removed.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
TripAdvisor is essential in my daily life as it affords me ample opportunity with just a simple click to find nearly anything where I am traveling so I'm not shooting in dark at a hit or miss service. I wish it offered reviews for department stores and other businesses or an option to enter that business if it is not listed.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
I love this app and TA in general. The latest version, however, has a bug they need to fix. In Forums, when you try to pull down the destinations menu after choosing Africa, it won't scroll past Cameroon. Overall, it's a great product but it needs a new bug fix right away!
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 4
I love this app, and use it often. My only suggestion is to allow users to search within their destination city. I couldn't remember the name of a coffee shop in Traverse City that I wanted to review, but there isn't an option to search for "TC coffee shop". Would be 5 stars if that existed. Still, I use this app to find restaurants and things to do no matter where we stay at or visit.
Version 5.92 2012-02-20 5
The coolest, most user-friendly and information-rich App available to intrepid as well as novice travelers. This is the only site you need visit when making travel plans. There isn't much of the planet left that I haven't travelled to and Tripadvisor is the App I always use when I make my travel arrangements.
Version 5.9 2012-01-07 5
I rely on tripadvisor during all of my travels.  While the web site is great, the iPad app is a totally different level.  I love zooming the map, searching within an area, and the integrated street level views.  Wow...now I know exactly the look of the neighborhood and the entire experience.  Totally great!
Version 6.4 2012-09-01 5
I loaded the Tripadvisor app before going to Dallas for the new year weekend. I found myself using it constantly when we had any decisions to make about where to stay, eat or what to do. And we were not disappointed with any if the advice give here.
Version 5.9 2011-11-23 5
Smartest, most intuitive and comprehensive travel app around, hands down!  Simplistic and useful, this app let's you search and book travel wherever you want to go in the world with travelers' reviews and pics!  Best of all, the app is FREE!  Now stop reading and press install to get it.  The world is your oyster with this app!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-26 5
I have now travelled through the US and several European countries and don't know how I travelled without this. It has taken the risk out of sight unseen hotels and restaurants and led to many memorable stories. Yes, the reviews aren't always spot on, but 90% is a huge improvement. Don't leave home without this.
Version 6.6 2013-04-12 4
This app was very helpful when I decided to go to Phoenix area without doing much planning ahead of time.  This, along with Yelp, are nice to have when thinking about doing something new.  Its nice to know what others think of something before you try it yourself.  I recommend this one for the traveler or the person wanting to experience something different.
Version 6.1 2012-04-27 5
What a great app, use it all the time until I updated it, now it crashes and burns as soon as it opens.  I have a version one iPad. Do not update if you wish to continue using this app. No fix in sight, it's been cheesed for at least 3 weeks. Your star system also will not allow anything but a 5 star rating, yet another geek scam
Version 6.6 2012-12-31 5
I always make TripAdvisor my first stop to get a trip going. Even when deciding where to go, to get a general feel for a place.  Then on to the specifics.  Great insights from other travelers help to make the final decisions.  And the app always works smoothly.  A Must Have.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
Never make a reservation without checking TA. Always check reviews on restaurants, hotels, resorts, or attractions. Never worry about the results as the members tell the truth. There are differences of taste and level of service expected but you can read a few reviews and get a feel for what to expect.
Version 6.1 2012-05-21 5
Very useful.  Have found evaluations, after visiting the establishments, accurate.  Some users over evaluate; some under evaluate.  Some evaluators do not evaluate accurately.  It is important to weight recent users scores higher.  It's world wide cover is a major plus. I consider this app as a "Best Available Evaluation Tool."
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
We have been using trip advisor for hotels and restaurants in seven different countries over the last three years and have found its ratings uniformly accurate in our experience. We consider it the same as word of mouth which is how we look for local services in the US.
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 5
I have booked with them 3 times bow and they have topped all other flight websites that make you open up 5 other pages whereas as these guys have all offers on one page and easily link you to the dealer of the offer. No hassle. Awesome. :) flying out to see my bf again in Illinois thanks to them.
Version 6.4 2012-09-09 5
While Yelp! will help you find places right away, Trip Advisor helps when you are planning your trip. There are prioritized rankings based on what people have reviewed most highly and most frequently. I don't go anywhere without consulting Trip Advisor in advance!!!
Version 5.8 2011-12-09 5
Trip advisor helps you find hotels, food places, etc. You can find the best places to go. Some are more than others but it is your decision if you want to spend the money on expensive hotels. 

If I did not have trip advisor I would not be staying at the nicest hotels, food places, etc. 

If you do not have trip advisor get it today.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
You open it and it uses your location to instantly display all restaurants and entertainment in your area, with ratings, reviews, and price information, all on map that shows where they are in relation to you. Like having a local with you on your trip.  Stunning and amazing to have such data at your fingertips.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 1
I have been very fond of trip advisor for at least 2 years now. I use them as tools when dining out but also for ways to improve my place of work. Recently there was a complete lie written about the manager, insult about the owner & a black mark (terrible mark) against the restaurant. The first. Trip advisor was contacted & said the person followed the guidelines. The person is using the persons name, full name in a defamation way. It's a complete lie & this person was not allowed to post on yelp or open table because a complaint was filed against her. But trip advisor allowed it. Why?
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 4
As good as the website, now in the form of a very user-friendly app. It is almost the only app you will need for all your travel planning needs, but unfortunately it does not check low-cost airlines when searching for flights, which means you also need a flights app (e.g. momondo). If it wasn't for that, I would give it 5 stars and just call it perfect.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
I am very confident to travel for having this apps. It helps us a lot in finding all the places that we need to go on our vacation. This is the apps that you need and a gps and presto, you will never get lost and you know what to expect because of the reviews..I give this a five star +. Excellent !
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 5
This app and Internet site is absolutely a necessity anytime you travel.  It is amazing on how much information it provides and while it may not cover every single hotel, restaurant or points of interest it is still is a must that you should never be without. Get it - use it - enjoy it!!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-31 5
I travel somewhere new every week from big city to small town with population: 100. I can honestly say that I have had 100% success in experiencing what I read on this app for reviews in about 50 situations (hotel/motel, restaurant). Right after my experience I write my review. App is so much easier than website.
Version 7.1 2013-07-18 5
I really enjoy trip advisor and being able to have a good app on my iPad is wonderful. The app has all the functionality of the website and as long as u create an account (you can link one to Facebook), u can access ur saves anywhere. Definitely a must have if u travel a lot.
Version 6.6 2013-01-31 3
Let me first say... I love Tripadvisor and I use the app religiously. 

My one complaint is this... a couple of updates ago, they made the app basically their mobile website, when beforehand their app was an actual app which simply downloaded content. You clicked on buttons, not on web links, which is what the current app does. 

That's what apps are made for... Not to just simply browse a website and call it an app.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-28 4
This is a fairly good app! It helped me find some decent restaurants. I do wish they included better options with choosing restaurants. Such as multiple filters. It also didn't update my current location. I had to restart the app multiple times or just use urbanspoon. I do recommend this app, though! It helped me figure out some "attractions" to see.
Version 5.9 2012-01-14 5
I downloaded this app right after I found out we are going to Charleston,SC & I don't know how we would have done without it!  I am still here in Charleston and I use it to find out places to eat, & to visit.  The reviews are quite informative and useful.  I highly recommend this app.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-28 5
Whether I am in my hometown or in Singapore with my hubby for business this is the app to use. I always find the best restaurant and obviously stay away from the ones with horrible reviews. I also always get the best hotels. Finding what to do in a foreign land is no problem with this app. Love love love it.
Version 6.0 2012-03-29 5
The app has a great combination of all the tools you need for great planning. Insights, maps, hotel/restaurant/store access, street view and, of course, reviews from real people.  I don't care for the new interface as much ...but the content is everything you need for planning a trip.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
Your last upgrade really did wonders for the usability of the app. The interface is much improved and I like the Bing map better than the Google map. Please keep improving this app. My wife and I own an RV and we intend to use this app to the fullest when we embark on our 2012 camping trips.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 5
I am glad this app is available on iPhone and iPad. Makes it easy to search places and see what others think before you go. Lets you write your review right away! Don't have to wait until you get home. 
Love having the ability to rate places and have your opinion read by others.
Version 5.7 2011-06-30 3
I like the app for finding things but I cant use it to write a review because it won't let me sign in with my Facebook account, which is how I originally signed up for a TripAdvisor account.  It seems like the app is one step behind it's website as far as using social media.  I guess I'll just have to keep using the website until the app gets it together a little more, but I hope that happens soon because except for that, it's a good app.
Version 6.6 2012-11-07 1
Trip advisor is indispensable for trip planning. Yet trip after trip when I'm trying to use the app on the road it's unusable. The map feature locks up every time.  When looking for restaurants and reading reviews and trying to locate on the map, it's unable to switch back and forth. Total lock up. I had this problem when I travelled a few months ago and can't believe it hasn't been fixed. Here I am traveling again and the app is useless. I'm switching to Yelp. Adios trip advisor. Do yourself a favor and DON'T leave on a trip counting on this app to help you on the road.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
Love it and I haven't left yet on our trip. It's easy, it gives every thing you you might want. My husband keeps saying during our trip planning, check trip advisor! Just can't say enough great things about it. Now on to our 3 thousand mile road trip. Will add more later. Thank you.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
Whenever I plan a trip for my family after deciding on our destination, the next thing we do is have our annual consultation with trip advisor. Now that the app is available for my iPad it's even easier to stay updated while on the go. The other social media out there cannot compare.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-29 5
Today I took my Granddaughter to the Weston Hotel spa in Savannah Georgia. They were professional, friendly, extremely clean and did an excellent job of waxing her eyebrows. They also made the guest fee very welcome with beverages a comfortable lounge area to wait in.  This spa should be named the best in Savannah!
Version 6.6 2012-12-09 5
Great app to see what others are saying about places you want to visit.  You can change reservations or be aware of where you want to avoid. My wife and I are keeping tracking of. Our vacation spot and found that we need to rent a car because of how remote the hotel is to the food.
Version 8.4 2014-02-03 5
Why waste money trying a new hotel or restaurant? Check trip advisor first and get the scoop on the ratings before you swipe your card! You can also contribute to the community by writing your own reviews and by tracking your travel! :) love it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 5
Never expected that this app would be this way, it's perfect in all means. The map shows you where you stand in the city and it gives you flight prices and advices(just like it's name). Above all that you can see what to do and where to go......

I will advice my friends family and people to download this app
Version 6.4 2012-09-09 5
Tremendous help and extremely good in navigating a new city. During my recent trip to Paris used it extensively for all attractions and restaurants and going to their top rated places was never a disappointment. Very informative. Their hotel ratings are limited to top 100 hotels in a city of 4000 or more hotels. So that was not a help
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
We never try a new place (hotel, b&b, restaurants, etc.) unless we check trip advisor. Even lower stars we'll still try because sometimes the choices are slim, but at least we know what to expect ahead of time. :) 
It's like one of those things you don't leave home without.
Version 6.6 2013-03-23 5
I like the candor reflected in the reviews. Some people like what I like and some propel do not. It is usually easy to fit the review to the reviewer and get a good picture of whether the place and the person might like or not care for the same things as I. 

A good source of information for all "trips".
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-10 5
This IS the place to stay while visiting S F - easy shot to all the action.  dawn could not be more helpful - she knew everything and how to find it.  The place IS funky - and that's a compliment. Reasonable, clean, relaxing, and the best place so far on our trip from Fla. book it and enjoy it!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-11 5
I love it. I get notifications on average prices, I check flights all the time, I love the calendars that let you choose the cheapest dates instead of forcing you to plug in specific dates. I trust the reviews on here so yes, I use it a lot when I'm researching my trips and things to do in areas. Love it:)
Version 6.2 2012-06-15 5
I travel frequently and like to refer to trip advisor while on the road to find things to do and places to stay. This app makes it very easy to do that. I am not a big reviewer typically, but if I find a spot worthy of a review, I can instantly post my opinions with this mobile app. Good work!
Version 6.1 2012-06-25 5
I love trip advisor...especially the app. I can't imagine how I lived without it prior to it's existence, to be honest. The traveler photos are critical, all the information you need is right there in a clear and concise format, to make a quick and informed decision for your travel. You will not be disappointed.
Version 5.9 2011-12-14 5
I use this site regularly to find good stuff in my own city!  And it's indispensable when traveling. It helps to read more than one review. Some people give low ratings for family friendly, loud restaurants, but that is generally what I am looking for.  So the written reviews are more helpful than the number of stars.
Version 6.6 2013-04-24 5
On every trip we take I dont go anywhere until I check Trip Advisor! It never steers me wrong and it is so helpful to have. i love reading everone elses reviews and then checking it for myself most of the time they are on point others not so much but its good to get pointers so we dont get blindsided. I love this App
Version 7.1 2013-07-17 4
I'm a reviewer and use TA often when traveling and most of the time I agree with the ratings. But I'm not sure how they are calculated.  I often find that lower rated places are much better but have not had as many ratings.  Also, there's no accounting for taste.  But when one is in an unfamiliar place, TA generally can be counted on for a comfortable room and a good meal.
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
This app is very helpful. I use it for all my vacation planning. I have it on my desktop computer as well. I go to it for which hotels to stay at, where to eat and what to do! I also give reviews as soon as I can. Listen to those who have been there and done that!
Trip Advisor is my go to tool even in my local home town. I love it!
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-01 5
I enjoy reviewing and checking out local everything when I am home or traveling, and the trip advisor app is as useful as my car. I thoroughly enjoy the ease of use combine with the options to find things other then restaurants. Download and enjoy.
Version 8.5 2014-03-11 5
Pappadeaux Seafood Restaurant in Albuquerque, NM is the best in town because the service is out of this world. The employees help each other out with a smile and always wanting to do more for the customer. It is always a pleasure to visit this seafood restaurant. Thanks to a great staff for your service.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 5
I have used trip advisor while in Thailand, Spain, Bonaire and all over the states. 
During the past week while traveling in New Orleans & Savannah, as well as New York City I used Trip Advisor to find tours and restaurants, as well as other points of interest. It has helped to make my travels spectacular!
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
One of the very best travel sites with reliable and easy to find information. Tripadvisor has saved me a ton of money on quality hotels over the years. App is very well-designed for the iPad. User friendly and intuitive. Good on the iPhone but iPad version a million times better.
Version 6.6 2013-01-14 5
I like the app so far.
I'm constantly using the other "Y" for foodie trips, but I can see that for International and tourist locations this app has more content.
And they even have an app that loads to your phone and no data is required (as long as you load the city before you use it)
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-28 5
We have utilized Trip Advisor when traveling to assist us in locating restaurants and sleeping accommodations.  The reviews from people who have experienced the particular places of business is most helpful to potential customers.  We would not travel without trip advisor.
Version 6.6 2012-10-05 5
I enjoy giving my impressions of restaurants and hotels.i try to be honest about the good and bad points, because everyone has his/her own selling points. When choosing hotels etc on out of town trips I ALWAYS check other people's reviews! Valuable tool for sure! :-)
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 3
I like this app but it is a bit frustrating because it is not fully synchronized with my Tripadvisor profile on the actual website. I have been using the "vacation rentals" feature quite a bit on the website, saving properties and keeping notes on them. But to my dismay, none of this shows up on the app.

Decent app tripadvisor, but stil need to work some more to get 4 or 5 stars from me.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-11 5
I'm a traveling freak, I love to look at places and really get a good look at where I'm going, because you know you can't just depend on pictures of the website. However, you can see pictures actually posted by the people who stayed at the hotel and also written reviews. Whether GOOD or BAD.
Version 6.2 2012-06-18 5
I started using this app when we went on vacation and found it to be very helpful. It is great if you want to try new things but don't know anyone personally whose been to a particular place because with this app someone usually has and they can tell you about it.
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 2
This is a pretty bad app compared to the website. There is no way when looking up hotels to look by availability. You have to search hotels first, pick the hotel and the see if they are available when you want. It is terribly inefficient. If you know the hotel you are interested in and want to look up I Infomation about that hotel, then the app is very helpful. It is not an app to use to search for available hotels on a certain date or dates. Stick to the website. Hopefully they will make a better app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-25 5
Incredibly good!!!
Exec Chef Randy...extraordinary culinary skills

We caught fish by day and THE chef prepared them 4 different ways...all exquisite!!

Asst manager Jerry made our experience super!!!

Our waiter Jacob was remarkable...service, humor and professionalism !!!

Thanks very much
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
I almost always look at reviews before I travel for work or pleasure to get a sense of how the properties are performing. Doesn't take long to sort out which places are doing a good job. One bad review does not a bad experience make but if you see several it might be time to re-think your plans.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-01 4
Stuck in the middle of china and want a burger. No worries trip advisor will tell u what's around. It's fantastic I don't have to worry about traveling around the world no more.  The only reason i am not giving it a 5 star is because i dont like their new maps. The one with google were better. Hopefully with the new ios 6 the map issue will be resolved
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
Love trip advisor on the big screen. This app brings the usefulness of the iPhone program to the iPad. Thanks for a good program. Very useful when on the road to find the best places. Thanks to all who take the time to provide reviews. I have offered reviews for years and glad others do as well.
Version 5.6 2011-05-18 5
As a person who works in the hotel industry, this app is great to get info on the go!! I also live in a town where the entire economy is based on tourism and wonderful customer service!! Using tripadvisor allows me to see what others think about places I want to go, but also keep up with where I work!! This is a handy traveling tool!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
I have used Trip Advisor for my last three big European vacations, including Vienna, Prague, Barcelona, Munich, Salzburg, and Venice. Two major changes have really disappointed me. First, you used to be able to arrange your entire itinerary, choose what day to see what, and print a formal itinerary with descriptions, phone numbers etc. I felt like a professional travel consultant to my friends when we travelled. Now it's gone, replaced by a save folder. Second, I hate Bing. The map serves no purpose when I have Google Maps on my phone with GPS. Please take is back to the old Trip Advisor.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-29 5
I use this app regularly to check reviews of places I'm thinking of visiting.  They are always spot on and I am always happy with my decisions based on TA.  I've know started writing my own reviews so I can give back to the community I always lean on.  
Love this App!
Version 8.3 2013-12-30 4

Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
Has proven invaluable in making smart decisions about what to do and more importantly what not to do.  The restaurant and activity reviews are spot on.  I contribute by making my share of reviews, good, excellent and not so good.  Do your fair share and let your experience be know.
Version 7.1.1 2013-10-10 5
I can forget an umbrella or a nice set of heels, but I never leave home without my Trip Advisor app on some device.  It's as good as the Web site -- intuitive navigation, the same great reviews, a chance to review hotels, restaurants and more from the app itself, and more.  Really sweet. Don't leave home without it.
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 5
I simply will not eat anywhere without this app. I used it primarily for vacations but now plan date nights with my husband based on reviews. It's awesome and reviews are spot on! Gotta take sone with a grain of salt but majority rules and we've never been steered wrong. I'm a HUGE fan!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
Leave your guidebook at home! The information is up to date & almost always very reliable. Use the phone numbers to verify hours & focus on the reviews that are most recent. Unfortunately in this economy things can change quickly so check back & take the time to offer your 2 cents.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5
I use this app every day when I travel, and it has never failed me. When traveling, if I use reviews online from other sources, I am often disappointed. I am always thrilled with the recommendations I get from Trip Advisor...for food and hotel. It has saved me more money than it costs!
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 5
Awkward to only view in landscape mode.  Difficult to figure out how to get to my favorite Forum...why change the menu?  Love TA, but why would you want to frustrate frequent users without providing new directions or at least a list of what changed and how to find things...annoyed
Version 6.6 2012-10-14 5
I think trip adviser is one of the best apps I've ever put on my telephone. I would recommend for anybody who travels to use this app on your telephone at work so great and it'll tell you real opinions of what people think of the hotels which is well worth to read it. If you travel a lot this is a great app for you!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
Like owning a lonely planet guide for the world. It's usually spot on with reviews of major attractions, though you won't find many hidden gems here. Would also like to see some improvements to the sorting filters so we can drill down by type more easily...descriptions of attractions don't always match up with filters.  Beyond that, get this app.
Version 6.6 2012-10-13 4
Great site for searching for all aspects of travel and keeping it organized.  Just started using today, so I am no pro, but it throws me off when I move the map and all of the info changes.  Also I wish they had a place for notes on each save to compare personal preferences at a glance when choosing a hotel...(has indoor pool, great view,etc.)
Version 5.8 2011-08-23 4
Finding it very good and informative on hotels/inns/B&Bs. 
The restaurant search filtering didn't work at all. "Yelp" was able easily to return restaurants within 2-5 mile radius; TripAdvisor failed--showed far too many far too far (up to 6 hr drive). 
When you're traveling, especially, and don't know the area, that one feature is one you want to work!
Version 6.1 2012-05-04 2
New interface is based on map area which is fine except when you select a "place" (i.e., hotel/restaurant/attraction).  The app then re-centers/resizes the map based on your selection and presents a new, smaller, list of places.  Also seems that no matter what map view is selected, the list of places in incomplete.

This new interface may provide a little more information and some other aspects of the interface may be better, overall the older versions of this app were much easier to use.
Version 6.0 2012-06-07 5
Love this website.
I am able see "real" reviews of hotels and destination from people like me. I love to travel, but need help finding the right vacation spot for the right price. This site has allowed me to post my reviews too. 

I know when I start a search, it will lead to a truly fun vacation.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-25 4
The dining info compares with another good source (urbanspoon) and although there is general alignment, there are differences which make both valuable for dining choices. Very helpful in planning things to do at various travel destinations. Found great recommendations on a recent trip to Montana for outdoor activities that were spot on.
Version 6.6 2013-02-24 2
I installed this thinking it would give me a more efficient way to post reviews and track my past ones yet it only does one if the two. No where in this app do I see a place to read my past reviews or see how many reviews I've posted, or how many people have read my reviews, etc.

Companies need to realize that apps should contain ALL of the same functionality as the website and not just the primary ones.

I'm really disappointed in this and uninstalled it immediately.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-06 5
I'm an active user of the TripAdvisor site and now from their app. I use it on a daily basis... I try new restaurants every other day and the reviews are 100% accurate. The app works well, it's easy to use and and it's a great tool to advise and suggest places near me. I access the TA app mora then my own social media apps.
Version 5.9 2011-12-09 5
I just looked at tripadvisor for the first time today but already I can see it is going to be quite a useful tool. I have found very interesting things around where I've lived all my life and never knew about. I just wish the site was more widely used with more reviews.
Version 6.3 2012-07-16 5
I truly make use of this fantastic travel app. Using my iPad with the Trip Advisor app has made traveling  much more convenient. I can research hotel, restaurants, activities, etc. quickly and with ease. It has made researching for travel simpler. Thanks for making it happen.
Version 6.6 2012-09-30 5
My laptop hard drive crashed on the second day of my trip and I used TA to book lodging from my phone.  The reviews from users were very accurate! Search filters with ranking and price saved me so much time looking at unwanted hotels and hostels.
Version 6.6 2013-01-12 5
the app does not allow guests to 'like' or find helpful the reviews they are reading.  As a reviewer,  that is my reward.  It allows me the opportunity to see what readers like or find helpful. Please find a way to bring this mainstay of your website to the app/mobile version.  Your reviewers need it!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-14 5
I have been vacationing twice a year, but always have been ignorant to the sights, and attractions. This application reveals all the popular sights. Now I find myself revisiting my old vacation spots just to really partake of the tourism that was missed when I was last there.
Version 6.1 2012-06-20 3
When I look for a hotel on certain dates, I want to be able to sort the search by availability. But it is not possible. Basically, you sort by location and then you need to go to each specific hotel, enter your dates, check several partners sites and then to get disappointed because hotel is fully booked. It is a long and frustrating process.
The reviews of travelers and photos however are very helpful.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 5
I've been using advisor for years, and apparently I just now getting around to giving it a review. 

Such a huge diversity of focus areas like restaurants, hotels, and attractions along with a huge user base which increases the value of the app exponentially.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
Tripadvisor is a world-changing website/app. What an amazing idea bringing the world together to provide reviews on places to go and things to see. I use tripadvisor any time I book a trip and also every time I return home. This is one app I am truly thankful for!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 2
1. ALWAYS have to login again even when checking "remember me" (so I never login)
2. Type too small to read in reviews so must use iPad's accessibility feature - why can't TripAdvisor allow stretching and zooming in?
3. All the email links included in Trip Advisor forum posts are not linkable

Bottom line - I love TripAdvisor on the WWW but only tolerate it on the iPad for the convenience of accessing a quick list of restaurants in areas where Yelp doesn't have a strong presence.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 5
We use this for both business and pleasure. We find the reviews very helpful and appreciate the personal opinions and comments. Very easy to use. I haven't figured out how to add a site and write a review but I have tried to add reviews on most of the sites that we visited that are already on here.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
This is the best local gem around . Perfect for a casual night out with the family. The pizza is as good as you can find in the USA . Now they added deserts .... Oh my. Pizza, wine and desert...I am in heaven. Kids are happy, mom and dad are happy... It's a great night. I love that the owner greets all the guests :)
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 5
I love this app. I've used Trip Advisor on my pc, but it is so much easier to have access to reviews when I'm traveling on either my iPhone or iPad. I was able to recommend a restaurant to my brother who lives in VA even though I am in FL!  Thanks for reading...I promise you'll love this app!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
As an owner of a restaurant and a hotel in a popular tourist destination in Costa Rica, we check TA every day.  The new forced upgrade for the iPad doesn't show all the venues.  For example, in a current search by popularity (previously rating) 1/2 or more of the hotels don't show up.  For the restaurants, search close to me or  y location ZERO restaurants showed up.  

Trip advisor is a valuable resource, how they could allow a developer to roll out a non functional update is beyond me.  I don't know if it is possible but I would suggest a rollback until the ap is ready and tested.
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 3
It's easy to pull up nearby restaurants and hotels, or by city, and easy to write reviews. 
I find that reviewers are generally too generous with their ratings and comments. Maybe I'm more critical. 
It's difficult to figure out the order in which places are listed:  is it by distance?, rating?, price?  I'd like to be able to sort by rating, in most cases. 
All that being said, I've been using it constantly on our recent trip.

As we are driving into Salt Lake City we are deciding what to do tonight! Based on the choices & reviews posted on TripAdviser  we have decided to see Saturdays Voyeur -for the 2nd time! Let's hope that we still can get tickets for tonight's performance! If not we'll be back on TripAdviser! Did I mention that this TripAdvisor app is Great!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 4
Works better on iPad than iPhone because iPhone reading area is tiny. Also I need to retype the destination location often In the course of a search because it resets to blank search page instead of holding the last search destination.  Should provide a quicker short cut to get to the reviews.  The app does not do justice to the website but still very useful.
Version 5.6 2011-05-19 5
This app has replaced iPhone's original Maps search function for me. It shows the distance, rating and reviews of all the good food, hotels, and things to see and do near you, and can lay them out on a map or in a pretty cool augmented reality style overlay on top of the current camera view, in real time! I'm very pleased with this app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
Trip Advisor for the iPad is like being the owner of a travel agency. Obviously, your final travel arrangements will always depend of the innumerable tricks used by the service provider (the airlines are the trickiest!), but with Trip Advisor you are very well equipped for the challenge!
Version 6.5 2012-09-15 5
A friend turned me on to TA about 5 years ago and now I never plan a trip without it! The reviews are generally helpful compared to other sites.  Always a good mix of people that over the top love or hate a place and why.  I have never had a "miss" when making reservations at a hotel or restaurant rated here on TA.
Version 6.6 2013-04-03 4
I really would have given this app 5 stars but I am having trouble reviewing on my iPad . If its possible, I sure cant figure it out. Was on a trip recently, and was grateful that this app was also on my phone so that I could check places that I passed along the way, to  decide if it was place I wanted to try.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-08 4
Just beginning to travel and visit various restaurants and Trip Advisor has been extremely helpful in our selections. Majority of the comments critique level of service, cleanliness, price, kid friendly. Thanks to all who take the time to input positive and negative comments. Sometimes I have gone against the comments and wish I hadn't.
Version 8.5 2014-03-01 5
I've been a member of trip advisor since 2008. I love to travel and submit posts on experiences as well as seek real time advice on new places. This app is so functional and easy to use at the click of a button. I can find what I need and also submit timely reviews with pictures.
Version 5.8 2011-09-26 5
I'm traveling with my husband in Argentina and was just saying how much I love trip advisor and how much we have been using the website to help us on our trips, I had just wished they had an app. And we found out right then they do! Loving this app and I can't wait to use it on our future travels.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
This App is a necessity for anyone who desires opinions of others who have taken the time to personally review the town, hotel, trip, activity, etc.  The good and the bad is never held back.  The usage/inclusion of google maps enhances the experience. If you plan on traveling to somewhere new, then this is a must.  Enjoy!
Version 6.1 2012-06-11 5
Easy to use, automatically updates the map as you resize it or change views.  I really like that can get back to the results list and map without having to re-enter your search information.  If the restaurant use Open Table, the page provides a direct link.
Version 8.5 2014-03-04 5
Great food, drinks & service! It's a good idea to think ahead and make reservations, but not always necessary. We have eaten there for lunch & supper on multiple occasions and have no complaints. Each chef's favorite creation is a must to try. You will not be disappointed.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-16 5
Trip Advisor is indispensable, especially when traveling abroad (outside the US), and the app makes it especially convenient to use.  Good linkage with location services and map.  Just ask for anything near you now and you get a very quick and useful response.
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 3
This app would be great if it let you log in to your account and, most importantly, saved your recent searches. It is SO frustrating when I do an extensive search and then come back a half hour later and it defaults to my current location and I lose everything!! I really appreciate that they have gone to the trouble of creating an ipad app but I will be using the regular site until that issue is addressed.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 4
Not a bad app at all. Use the service from the web for a lot of my European travel and have always like it - though the number of advisors for many of the stops are few so a solid sampling is hard to come by. As for app it is well constructed with a great layout and abundant features. The link to the current location by way of recommended stops is wonderful. Well done.
Version 8.5 2014-03-02 5
I'm a big fan of TripAdvisor. We often check reviews and comments before we go some place new, or explore an area. Be sure to check any negatives, but take them with a grain of salt--sometimes the help avoid problems before they start.
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 5
I have been using the tripadvisor website for a while now, and it is the most reliable and objective source of information if you are planning a trip. This app is just as great since it brings almost all of the functionality of the website, and I would definitely recommend it!
Version 5.93 2012-02-27 5
I originally signed up for trip advisor when planning a trip to New Zealand. This was several years ago, and there was not a great amount of information easily accessible on line at the time.  By now it is more widely used and therefore more helpful. I use it regularly and am glad to add my experiences.
Version 6.1 2012-05-26 5
Have come to depend on Trip Advisor to be the very best app I could use to find lodging, restaurants, etc.  Being able to read reviews ahead of time is terrific help.  Love the maps, nearby attractions, etc.  It is so very well thought out and a wonderful help while traveling.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 4
Good app. Used it a lot, especially for meals.  The save tab was really helpful people would recommend something to us and I would save it for the day. The downside was there was not a place for some of the physical attractions like hiking and stuff. That was a big part of the trip and would like to have been able to save those.  Overall very helpful.
Version 6.6 2013-02-05 3
I find it hard on this app to see B and Bs- only hotels come up. This is not a problem on web and iPhone versions. So I find the iPad app pretty poor.
 Also if I am halfway through a review and close the app it doesn't save it and I have to start agin.

A history tab so you can view recent views quickly and a way to save draft reviews would make it much better. 
iPhone app I love
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 5
I love Trip Advisor!  I use it when I'm planning a trip, checking hotels and at a destination looking for a place to eat. I have found "specialty" restaurants will be rated higher than "traditional" restaurants because they have more loyal customers.  But none the less Trip Advisor is a great tool to have in your pocket.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-01 5
Easy to use app to help plan your trip and explore hotel, restaurants and local attraction. iPhone version of full site is intuitive and fast. 

It's not entirely clear how they rank the establishments in a category but they seem directional correct.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
This is one of the most professional apps I have ever used. I am a journalist and travel very frequently to different parts of the world and this app just gives the very best tips that only a very veteran tour guide would give you (only if you give them a big tip and this app does it all freely for you!)
Version 5.8 2011-10-08 5
We have used this app--in conjunction with Maps--to make plans on the fly and to make up for limited prior planning.  While it is a luxury for us--not a must--we will continue to loyally utilize this app and reap the associated time saving benefits.
Version 6.1 2012-04-05 5
I love to travel and this app is the most helpful in making every adventure a great experience.  Having a breakdown of hotels, restaurants and things to do with a map interface, and easy links to reviews and company websites making travel plans has become a pleasant experience.
Version 6.5 2012-09-13 5
Having a site that rates hotels for you as you travel. Saving the trouble of having to search around on the web for hotels on the area. I like you can post reviews as well. There's something great about being able to warn people about crappy hotels and praising others.
Version 6.2 2012-06-17 5
If you are like me and do a lot of travelling, planning every little detail can really drain the fun right out new places.  That is where this app is amazingly useful.  Just plug in your city or use the "near me now" function and find good places to eat, intersting places to see and so on.
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 4
You can learn a great deal about where you plan to go from others reviews.   This gave us great tours, good ideas, and made our travel experience better. Travel is still an adventure, but the extra help makes the adventure more fun. The app helps you navigate this on the go. Especially helpful when you are enroute or in your adventure.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
While traveling this past week had bad experience  staying at treasure island las Vegas. I mentioned this to the person sitting next to me on my flight she suggested this app and explained what it's used for, I'm glad that I was able to vent my frustration and maybe help someone this is a great app for information!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 1
The latest update is missing one of the most useful features: average rates for each hotel listed. I know these are never exact, I always have in mind a general budget for a stay. And there is no way to filter for, say, 3 star hotels. The only choice is 3 stars and up--so I have to wade through overpriced luxury hotels I don't want. Now I have to go to a booking site or the hotel's website to see whether I'd consider a hotel based on rates. This makes a search much too time-consuming. I'm a frequent user and reviewer. Bring back hotel rates, please!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-29 5
I definitely appreciate all of the reviews posted, both positive and negative, to get a sense of the restaurant &/or hotel I am considering, so I can make an informed decision. I also enjoy being able to share about those places I really enjoy...and those I don't!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-18 5
Love the TripAdvisor App. Every time we travel, it is the first thing I check out and, more often than not, it is right on restaurants and hotels. I also spend a lot of time just browsing the app when I'm not even traveling.  Highly recommend, 5 stars.
Version 5.8 2011-10-05 5
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to fly into an unfamiliar airport late at night and have no idea where lodging, meals, police, virtually anything is located?

This app is absolutely amazing!  It is invaluable for travelers.  I cannot recommend ANYapp higher than this one.
Version 5.9 2011-11-05 5
Terrific resource. Very helpful in finding restaurants and tour resources on a recent trip to Argentina. While tour books were useful, TripAdvisers info was more current and we felt we found better restaurants than tour books told us about. Also helped us rank what we wanted to see in Buenos Aires. Great app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 3
Since the last app update you can no longer go back page from a forum post you are reading. If you are 3 or 4 pages in to the forum posts and you click one to read, you have to go back to the most recent post instead of where you were in the list. Basically like the app. Read trip advisor on my computer which is better, but the app is ok if you know where to navigate.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 5
This app is great in that it links a wealth of information about hotels, attractions, and restaurants while combining it with user reviews to give you the best possible picture of what is available in the area no matter where you may be.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-23 5
I absolutely love this app I can go to any city and not have to stop someone and ask for directions to a nice restaurant or hotel I just pull out my 5c and I look it up on your app and it's amazing because it doesn't take me more than 1 minute.   If I could give a hundred stars I would  Thank You
Version 6.6 2013-04-03 5
Have used the web version for a few years so when I gave the SO an iPad thought we would try the version for this as well. This is great as we can take it along on our trips and write reviews right after so everything is fresh. Kudos to the developers as they did a great job.
Version 6.1 2012-06-04 5
This app has saved me from making a lot of bad choices while on the road for work.  Comforting to know I can trust it and take customers and guests to tried and true places...did I forget to mention that I no longer have to rely on the hotel staff for suggestions?!  This app is indispensable!
Version 6.4 2012-08-18 5
I am still kicking myself for not coming to this website before making my reservations at this dump. I won't make the same mistake twice. I could have saved myself and my family from spending the night in a roach motel!
Version 5.9 2011-12-22 4
I like this app because it is fast and robust for searching.  Two major things I find lacking:

The login link is impossible to find unless you happen to stumble on it.

Even if you do manage to find it and login, none of your profile information, saves, favorites, reviews, etc. come into the app once logged in.  So what's the point?
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 5
I use this app all the time I find a lot of great food because of it. I just wish they market to more businesses, I live in south Florida and I can never find anything young people would find fun. I only 23 add some clubs bars and things not easily found. Regardless this app is awsome.
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 2
I used to love this app as I could use it to find a hotel or restauraunt when traveling and then track over to there using their gps location blip on the screen. This no longer works and in fact never updates once you've performed a search. I loved this part of the app as I could search for a hotel and see its location relative to mine as I was still moving. Now it is much more difficult to find my bearings and I find I am much less able to use the app. Please go back!
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 4
I have come to really rely on the service, and having the app at my fingertips is very ha dy.  The app is well done, and provides a quick review of locations while it is still fresh on your mind.

One addition that would be nice is to be able to geolocate the establishment while you are there so you could review it without looking it up
Version 5.9 2011-12-26 5
Trip advisor is a must to know and decide about hotel stays and all maner of info regarding restaurants, cruise ships, cities, etc. We' ve always found the ratings 95 % true. The 5% difference sometimes happens because individual experience in the moment. Thank you for a wonderful reliable info.
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
I really like the grid format when searching for various flight options.  My only suggestion would be to have a recommended list of the actual flights which offer the lowest fares rather than having to determine the right combinations.
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5
I am glad I downloaded this app.  I love to read other people's opinions about restaurants before I go to them.  Usually, pretty accurate.  You have to keep in mind that not everyone has the same taste, but I have avoided some pitfalls with TripAdvisor's help.  Will use often.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-14 2
I use it a lot. I am vigilant about being accurate and helpful. Yet the phone app won't let me ADD a place - such as a local statue & park - every time I try. I've tried to send customer feedback and gotten the runaround each time. Their "contact us" page could be a skit on Saturday Night Live. I've sent two written pleas to the "new account" area and gotten no response. 

They should charge 50cents for the app and hire staff to make it usable. Or might that hinder future sale prospects?
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
Given the large number of people now using trip advisor, this crowd-sourced travel review app has to be one of the best in the iTunes Store.  I travel often and use this all the time to check on hotels, restaurants, and attractions.  Great app that I highly recommend.
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
Have now been in Panama City for 3 days and have used the reviews constantly. Have yet to be disappointed, but have discounted 1 or 2 Bad reviews when there are several good to excellent one. Have had my first review posted and will continue to post reviews as we go places, do things and eat out.
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
I always try to submit something for restaurants, hotels, or other establishments to provide honest and timely information. While I may not agree with others, I feel it is part of making social media successful. Trip Advisor does a great job and reviews are easy to submit.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-28 4
This app would be easier to use if it functioned more like the "full-sized" desktop version. It's easier to search, but difficult to navigate when trying to use the social media functions you are used to on the website.

If they keep improving it, it will be the Facebook of the travel apps.
Version 5.9 2011-11-16 5
I have been using TripAdvisor for a year or two now, soliciting advice as well as offering my own advice and reviews. I love the service and the contact with other travelers who generously share their knowledge. The app button saves a google search for the website.
Version 6.6 2013-02-12 1
Trip advisor has always been helpful to me, so I thought to myself- why not make my life easier by downloading the app?! Um, that was a major waste. Every freaking time I click back to see the restaurant choices I entered in, it takes me back to the home page and I have to enter in ALL my information and filters alllll over again. This app makes me want to cuss and I have never cussed in my life. Use your smart phone to pull up trip advisor on the Internet, do not waste your time with this app. So freaking annoying!!!! (Get this fixed please!!!!!)
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-15 5
I travel often for work and play. Trip advisor has always pointed me in the right direction. If you're someone who doesn't like to just "wing it" and you like to know that you're going to be in a clean hotel or eat at a fabulous restaurant, this app is for you.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 4
So far I have just explored trip advisor, using it to see what comes up while in our vacation home. So far I think it's great. Pin points restaurants and information about them nicely. I would recommend this app, especially for those traveling in unfamiliar areas in order to locate restaurants, activities, etc. near their residing place. Gives nice map and directions.
Version 5.8 2011-09-13 4
I have been using Trip Advisor for most of my travel making decisions and really love the functionality of the web site. So I was a little skeptical about the app. It's actually better than I thought, all the information is there. You just have to get used to using the app so you can easily find that information. 4 out of 5
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 5
Front desk staff at check-in was friendly and professional.  Room was clean and comfortable, bed and bedding excellent.  I intentionally made note of what exit it was, nothing better than knowing where you can find a clean room when you're traveling.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-23 5
I use this every week. I plan my trips then look at traveler reviews to decide which hotel I want to stay at. Once in a new city I access restaurants near to me and then decide which is the best to visit. I haven't been steered wrong yet!

Last update fixed all bugs. Great APP!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
This application. Just keeps getting better. Honest reviews you can trust. I have been using this app for a long time, always checking before going and it is pretty accurate. I really like the near me now feature. I even started writing reviews.
Version 5.8 2011-10-09 5
I have used TripAdvisor in every city I have travelled to for the last year and it has always helped me make good decisions on restaurants and other activities that I would have been lost on otherwise.  Even use at home occasionally to read reviews on things I haven't tried before.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 5
This is a "must have" application.  It is a wealth of information for local place as well as when looking for places when on the road.  The interface is intuitive and the performance snappy. We confirmed ratings of local places we knew and were delighted with the accuracy.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
I used trip advisor for my trips before I had an iPad .  Now that I have an iPad and this app I am in traveler heaven.  Tonight I'm hanging out on my bed, iPad on my lap, planning my trip to Paris using the trip advisor app to check out hotels.  Easy to use, lots of pictures, responds really fast...I have nothing but praise.
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
I use this app all the time. Being a bit of a germ-a-phobe this app nearly always saves the day. Reviews are helpful and always help us find the best places to stay! Don't book a hotel until you've searched it here!!! Just as great as the website, just now in my pocket!
Version 6.6 2013-02-27 5
Trip Advisor is an essential part of any travelers weaponry against being cheated out of there hard earned cash, I personally use this app and main web site for every stage of my planning a trip.
The reviews can be filtered into genuine travelers and people that just want to vent.
Version 5.6 2011-06-13 5
I absolutely love Tripadvisor and the iPad app is even more easily accessible than the website. I love how easy it is to sort through items with the map right there, especially when researching a new city. And being able to save items is very handy too. I love this app so far!
Version 6.1 2012-06-11 5
I love that the forums are now on this app, but I hate the find me and search buttons at the bottom. I accidentally touch them when I'm scrolling the page and I have to start all over. I don't know how you could fix this but it drives me crazy. Other than that I love it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-14 5

Version 8.5 2014-03-01 5
Intrigued by glass art? Conrad Williams tells you about techniques, shows you how, and helps you make a work of art!  He is an eXcellent teacher and a pleasant person to spend time with.  I highly recommend a Conrad Willis glass blowing workshop-  or two!
Version 6.0 2012-03-24 5
I never make travel plans without checking the reviews first from TripAdvisor.  I base  my travel plans on with other people say about the hotels they stayed in... It really is important that everyone reviews the places they stayed in and dined in..Thanks TripAdvisor and to All that put their 2 cents in :) Pat
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-17 4
I love this app but I noticed you can't share pages.  I was researching restaurants for an upcoming vacation and I wanted to email or text my wife one of the restaurants.  Unfortunately, no such luck.  I can't do it.   

But otherwise, it is a great and extremely useful app.  It has made planning a vacation so much easier.
Version 5.92 2012-02-05 5
Used this app to plan 3 trips now and couldn't be more pleased. Combination of mapping features (locations and things nearby like restaurants) and reviews saves time by avoiding those false starts. Love being able to do research at home and save items for easy retrieval on the road.
Version 6.6 2012-11-16 5
I have used this site for quite sometime and find it quite helpful.  They seem to be very fair and post excellent And poor reviews and the consistency certainly seems to be there. I have recommended this site to several of my friends and they have found useful as well.
Version 1.0 2008-07-11 3
OK - I think the title is my review.  Here's what would be nice in the app.
Version 6.2 2012-06-21 1
I like trip advisor a lot. Trip advisor on the web, to me, deserves five stars. This app does not have the same functionality nor the sama data, apparently. 
If you search for restaurants in a foreign destination on the web, you get much more results than on this version. You can't write detailed reviews like on the web. The app asks you every time you open it to log in and link to facebook, never mind that you have said NO ten times before. Once they fix these issues, my rating surely will go up.
Version 8.5 2014-03-02 5
I guess my title says it all, to why this App is cool, coz those who were somewhere before you have given their opinion, and the more people experience that place, the more accurate the opinion. 
It includes touristic venues, restaurants, hotels and more.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
The First stop that any beer enthusiast should make while visiting Santa Rosa has got to be the Russian River brewery on Fourth street. Many flavors for every pallet, hard to make a bad choice here. Try the sampler and find your favorite. Pliny the Elder wins my vote, at 8% this double IPA does the trick... Enjoi :)
Version 6.6 2013-01-16 5
Trip Advisor not only made an excellent vacation but made it possible. Your unbiased reviews were the difference knowing where to stay in an international vacation. I will highly recommend Trip advisor to others and we use it every time I travel in the future!
Version 6.6 2013-03-09 1
The iPad version has a serious flaw that has been there for a long time. For many locations, especially outside the US, many of the listings for hotels, attractions, etc. simply will not show. In a number of places the top few attractions on the web site listing are not listed on the app. In some locations 2/3 of the listings are missing. 

To use a version with that many omissions would be dumb; almost as dumb as Trip Advisor is for not fixing the problem. 

The iPhone version seems fine, but on the iPad, just use the web site and skip the miserable app.
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 5
We use this app to choose hotels, restaurants, etc., especially in big cities. I love both the pictures and tips from other travelers, real people. It is invaluable when traveling, much like having a bunch of spies around the country (or world I guess) giving you advice. Love it!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 5
My family and I take long summer road trips stopping in cities along the US and I have always used Trip Advisor.  The app takes it a step further by allowing me to check out local "things to do" instantly.  Love it, it is very helpful when planning destinations.
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 5
I'm very frequent Tripadvisor website user, and this app on my iPad takes it to the next level especially when traveling. The UI is excellent, and the maps work well. Unfortunately quite a few places don't have location recorded.
Version 8.3 2014-01-04 5
Have used this app for a couple of years now. Come to depend on it. Get an overview of everything from places to eat, travel and lodging. One in Mn. was right on about the regulars at a place we stayed. 
Also like to offer my experiences so others may benefit.
Version 6.6 2013-01-05 5
Easy to use, easy to navigate, intuitive.  Up to date.  This is 1/5/13 and reviews included on hotels open for only 2 weeks.  Gives you a sense of trust with such up to date info.  Links with all the major travel sites as well.  Well thought out, excellent performance. Nice app!
Version 6.1 2012-05-31 5
TripAdvisor provides REAL reviews from REAL people. I find it very helpful when I'm traveling. It's a great tool when you're trying to find places to stay, things to do or good food and you've never been somewhere before. I use this app often and generally agree with the reviews.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-04 5
I use Tripadvisor whenever I travel to help find the best hotels, restaurants, and other travel arrangements. To date, almost every review has been fair and accurate.  This is a great app to quickly research city resources and help locate the best deals for the money.  Highly recommended!
Version 6.6 2013-03-15 5
What a great tool on my road trip from New York to Florida. It is very easy to navigate through the app. Sure has made it easy to find what I'm looking for, and for I may not. So far, it has pointed me in the right direction and have been pleased with the outcome. Love the app. Highly recommend.
Version 6.6 2012-10-05 5
I've used this app for the last couple of trips I've planned. I save my potential things to do and restaurants as well as my hotel. It's great to be able to see where things are related to the hotel before arriving. Plus the reviews are great in helping me make decisions. Love it!
Version 6.2 2012-07-11 5
TripAdvisor is a wonderful app to use when trying to locate quality restaurants while vacationing in different cities. We tried several 4 star and higher restaurants in both Arizona and Florida while on vacations and the reviews were spot on! Very dependable reviews.
Version 8.4 2014-02-01 2
Love TripAdvisor as a website but the iPad App is almost useless.  The reason is that the programmers decided to create intrusive floating frames to obtain your travel information before you even decide to take a trip or not.  Therefore, an otherwise wonderful experience is completely destroyed by these frames that keep floating over everything you do and are looking at.  They just get in the way so do yourself a favor and avoid this app if you can and simply go online
Version 5.9 2012-01-13 5
We use this app everywhere we go. Takes the guess work out of where to eat and stay. We found ourselves with an extra night without a hotel in Italy. I whipped out TA and was able to secure a great place at a phenomenal price. Our friends blindly booked another hotel at double the cost.
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 5
I travel a lot for pleasure and business. Finding a good hotel or restaurant in a place you do not know is not easy. 
This site gives a balanced overview. I have used it so much in the last two years that I have decided to start contributing my reviews as well.
Version 6.6 2012-12-08 5
Great reviews of places to travel. Also has maps, contact info, booking info, and even photos of the places to visit! This app allows many ways for the traveler to give useful data for the future traveler. Nicely done. Hasn't crashed yet; that's good too!
Version 6.2 2012-07-03 5
Great app to help make decisions about your next journey.  Authentic (typically) reviews with helpful/impact-full  considerations.  I depend on these reviews for making final travel decisions... or to explore new travel regions!
Version 8.3 2013-12-29 5
We haven't been disappointed with this apps suggestions.

Only problem i have had was a review that I did for a restaurant a few minutes ago... The app would not allow me to give the restaurant 5 stars.. To submit my review I had to give it 4 stars... Please fix.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-20 3
I got an email telling me a friend of mine had written a review, and offering a link for me to read it. But the link just takes me to login with Facebook, and when I finally surrendered to that, it drops me at the front screen. I can't get to the review. I can't find my froends' activity unless I sell out all my Facebook info. Not doing it. So although this app helps me find restaurants, I am quite annoyed with it.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 5
This app was good before, but the newest update has made TripAdvisor one of the best free apps available. It is very easy and fast to use, if fact I could not believe how little time it takes to look up an airfare on this app. It has to be the quickest I have ever seen. Highly recommended!
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
I love the TripAdvisor app for both the iPhone and iPad. They are easy to use, loads information fast and makes it easy to save information about hotels, restaurants, and attractions. I had many wonderful travel experiences with TripAdvisor's apps.
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 5
You can learn a lot of things before traveling with this app also when you are in a new city you can discover many things and read  people experience about these areas that you want to go so that helps :)
Version 6.1 2012-07-08 5
I went on a last minute trip and needed a hotel room. I used other apps on my phone that took me to too many other links to get the bottom line- price and amenities. Trip Advisor laid out the comparisons on one page. I made a reservation within a couple of minutes of opening this app! Thanks!
Version 5.92 2012-01-18 2
I love TripAdvisor, the web site it's awesome! This app does the site no justice! Until I can sign into my TripAdvisor account and post under my user name answer and ask questions like on the site I give this app two stars. The awesomeness of their site comes from the interactions between other travelers! This app is merely a read and post review app. Let me login in to my account and post pictures from my iPad so I can answer questions and ask other travelers questions then I'll revise my review to 4 stars.
Version 6.2 2012-07-03 5
On Trip Advisor, that is Went to Barcelona, not one misstep in advising. Used it at home too, and found a fabulous Thai restaurant that I somehow missed( they don't advertise and are in an out of the way location) but TA found it! Am using it on my upcoming family trip to Europe. It's Annie Sullivan to my Helen Keller!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-24 5
Have found Trip Advisor to be very helpful. Used it this summer for our trip to Montana and Canada. If you read several reviews of a place, you can get an accurate picture. 
Stayed in some great places recommended. Will continue to use it when traveling.
Version 6.6 2013-02-24 1
The iPad version of this app needs work.  Message notification is almost non-existent and its impossible to access any "saved trips" or add anything to a saved using the app.  Also, when doing a hotel search, you get far fewer hotels than when using the web site!   Also, there's no way to filter out hotels when interested in only B&B's.  Since TripAdvisor is owned by Microsoft, I'm not surprised that they don't want to make the iPad app better!  Particularly now that they're pushing their own tablet.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
I'm planning a trip to Italy for myself and several friends and the information and reviews on trip advisor have been invaluable.  How else would I know about cooking classes in Cortona? Or about which tours in Rome, Florence and Venice are the best value?
Version 5.9 2011-11-21 5
I totally depend on My Trip Advisor .....we just got back from London,Rome, Bolognia, Venice, and Perugia....a terrific 3 week trip...and had a wonderful time.....my Trip App was used on a daily basis. It provided guidance and helped us make the most of our time.  I love my Trip Advisor App...I give it a 10 out of 10!
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5
We travel for leisure frequently, and I never reserve a hotel room without checking Tripadvisor. The forums are also an invaluable resource when needing area information and tips. Tripadvisor has a prominent place in my "Favorites" and a front page icon on my iPhone. 5 stars out of 5!
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5
I love using TripAdvisor - from Nicaragua to Spain to Zambia, and points in between, we've had some great - and delicious - advice, and shared when we've returned.  The iPad format really makes it great to read and switch between screens...we're working on a trip right now!
Version 5.92 2012-02-09 5
I used to use Trip Advisor on my computer all the time whenever I was on the road. This app is so much handier because I can simply pull up reviews and suggestions on my phone instead of lugging the laptop out and waiting for it to fire up. So far the app has worked just fine for me.
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
This app is just great either for everybody that love to travel or just for find something new in your local city.
this app is really help me a lot during my travel from explore an exciting place to find a delicious restaurant,definitely one of the best travel app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-21 5
After traveling for years and checking reviews through various sites, I've found that Tripadvisor has the most honest reviews. Now that I have the app for my iPad, I'm reviewing all of the hotels and restaurants I visit to give something back.
Version 5.6 2011-05-21 5
I trusted the hotel website .... Never again learn my lesson. Had I checked trip advisor I would have known ahead of time that the place was a dirt, mold & bug infested,  place. Trip advisor helped us find the nice clean....bug free hotel! Thank you!
Version 6.3 2012-07-20 5
Have used TA to plan a trip to Rome, and to do cruise ship excursion workarounds more economically.  Great advice every time.  I use it to find restaurants domestically, and again, always on the mark.  Excellent info, easy to use, and free . . . what's not to love?
Version 6.6 2013-04-06 5
I have stayed here many times and have had a very good experience.  Excellent service from the front desk .  Mark was a life saver, he went out of his way to help me find and located a lost credit card . 
Spacious clean and quiet rooms.
Version 8.1.1 2014-01-19 5
Helpful in many ways....hotels, restaurants in areas near motels. I use as we drive. Decide where may stop, check Trip Advisor for hotel reviews, pics. Then check out restaurants. When flying out of town I check out the same. Never disappointed!
Version 5.4 2011-05-05 5
Working in the service industry, I am quick to realize that reviews are key. Trip Advisor gives you the tools to perfect a vacation or business trip. Always use this great website/ app whenever you are "in Rome", just don't forget one thing! Remember, always ask the locals!
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
Without exception, my starting point for any trip & in particular, booking a hotel starts with Trip Advisor - it never lets me down with only one exception (when the reviews were glowing & the hotel was awful) out of dozens of bookings. Got to have it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-23 5
This is the first place I go to plan a trip or select a place to eat.  The feedback is reliable and by using the city- specific forums, I can get answers to incredibly specific questions by people who have been there, done that.  Couldn't leave home without it!
Version 6.5 2012-09-15 5
Excellent for finding places to stay and to eat. Rarely led astray.  Mostly, reviews are on the mark and accurate. Occasionally get an undeserving review, either in the positive or negative.  I find that if I stay in the top 10-20, I get what's described. Definitely a useful app, with decent accuracy.
Version 5.8 2011-10-12 5
I am on the road 6 months of the year and find Tripadvisor a valuable goldmine of information. I could not travel and book the hotels and eat out without consulting it first. I have been in over 53 countries and this site seems to cover them all. Sincerely, Patrick Faiola, Honolulu and New York City.
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5
TripAdvisor is the place I start my travel planning long before I make a booking. I can get great ideas from others experiences and the hotel reviews by others give a variety of perspectives which I find helpful.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-24 5
This app is the best travel app I have used , I do not drive and I tend to walk around in most cities I travel 
I was in Prague a few days back and had no problem in finding the destination with my data roaming turned off ! 
And now I am in Berlin covering most of the city 
Love it !
Version 5.9 2012-01-03 4
Fantastic app!  As a traveling family, it is always helpful to read the reviews of those that have gone before us.  In the same way, it is rewarding to share our experiences so that others might share the same great experiences and avoid our mistakes.  If only there was a way to ferret out the reviews of property owners.  A must have for all travelers.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-19 1
I'm extremely disappointed in the map search function.   Search hotels -> Select City -> Enter Dates -> View Availaible hotels on map.  Except the hotels aren't available.  The designers of the app require the user to check availability for each hotel on the dates entered.  This is disrespectful of the user's time.  What's the point of the app?  I can search individual hotels using a Google search that places hotels' icons on a map.  

Also, null pointers or other general careless use of memory leads to frequent crashes.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
My husband thinks I like technology too much, but even he was impressed with the usefulness of TripAdvisor on our motorcycle journey through Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.  It was helpful in getting advanced reservations and determining the best options for dining.
Version 6.6 2012-11-19 5
This is a great tool when deciding where you would like to spend your money. Just be aware that one persons perception may not agree with your own. We have risked lower rated places and found it to be quite the contrary.
Version 7.0 2013-05-01 2
The app is nothing more than their website shrunk and reorganized to fit an iPad's screen. Two serious problems beyond the clunky layout and too-small controls:

1. The app doesn't work in portrait orientation. This is the only app I own -- of over 100 -- that doesn't function in the iPad's natural portrait orientation.

2. Scrolling is incredibly buggy: trying to scroll through reviews is an exercise in frustration, since taps and gestures are routinely ignored.
Version 5.6 2011-05-30 5
Trip Advisor is great for planning a vacation but it's also invaluable when at your destination.  Finding things to do and how to get there couldn't be easier with the map layout and location services. If you like the web site you'll love this app. Can't beat free either.
Version 5.93 2012-02-26 5
I plan all hotels based on other traveler photos. Of course the hotel is going to have great photos but traveler photos give you the real truth!  We have not been disappointed with a hotel since we have used trip advisor and the app makes it easy to use anywhere!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-20 5
An absolute must when you travel and I can't tell you how many times were were saved from a horrible meal and instead had a great one because if this app.  They are constantly improving it. A must for the active traveler in particular
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
An amazing tool that gives you instant access with reviews for Hotels, restaurants and destinations!!! It's also great that you can leave a review of your experience while on the road an fresh in your mind!!!

Thank you.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-09 3
The Internet version is faster and less buggy.   Have wasted time writing reviews on the app, as it crashes at the end and looses my review, other bugs, it's slow and you push on a button and it jumps all around to pages I don't want.  Very slow, keeps switching from rating by distance to rating by rating without my selecting this.  I find it very frustrating.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-20 5
I use TripAdvisor before every trip, business or personal.   Great access to hotel, restaurant and attraction information and details.   Reviews are very helpful and forums allow for great access to individualized reference when needed.
Version 6.5 2012-09-16 3
Being a frequent traveler, I have always relied on tripadvisor to pick the hotels and restaurants that best cater to my needs.
I totally believe that the best food and hotel critics are the average customers such as myself who take the time to share their experiences so that others can benefit from them.
As for the app, I think that it needs a lot of improvements as it lags, crashes, and is frequently non-responsive.
Version 6.2 2012-06-26 5
The app is great for those times when going to the full web site isn't really an option. Tripadvisor has led me to some awesome excursions I might not have otherwise seen, and has kept me from some that might have made my trip miserable!  Thanks to everyone who posts!
Version 8.2 2013-11-30 5
Easy to use app and most reviews are spot on. Use to find what's near you or search out a point of interest. Find that nice hotel or satisfy those last minute munchies.  I have even used it to find less know but excellent eateries at home. Get it. You won't be disappointed
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 1
I took an update on all apps including trip advisor yesterday.  Now I can just get it so it is
sideways on iPad and the flights is no longer available. 
Since we are in Mexico and planning to return home at end of March, this is a REAL big
inconvenience.   We booked for flight down (one way for flexibility) and now it shows me
all sorts of exotic places, not where we want to go.   Help !    please change it back to
how it was.   It was way more friendly prior to update. 

(who in hell does these 'updates' anyway?   what kind of mentality do they have???)
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 4
Works well...  Love trip advisor in any form and the mobile app keeps getting better and better.

Small niggles:
- Wish finding a hotel or business was a bit easier. The title cuts off and you often click on the wrong one
- wish you could get to settings from any screen... Have to go all the way back to home
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 5
Good app very handy when traveling. It needs to add a function to share the listings however. It would make it even more functional. I love tripadvisor when searching for hotels, it has saved me from some real bad hotels numerous times. Easy to use and reliable app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-23 5
I tend to provide reviews on the fly and my only wish is that I could edit them through the app. 

I also wished that there was a way to respond to replies.  One hotel accurately described itself on TripAdvisor but was misleading on its website but I can't point this out.
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 5
Excellent app for locating landmarks and mapping out a touring route. Mapped trip to NYC in a matter of minutes, hitting all the landmarks. Easy to use and laid out sites on map of NYC with locations of transit stops, then saved to a file for future reference. I plan to use for all my trips.
Version 6.6 2012-12-30 5
We love Trip Advisor.  It has guided us in selecting places to stay and great places to eat.
Just today we ate at the #2 suggestion for lunch in Galena, IL. Which was spot on.  For dinner we ate at the # 1 rated Goldmoor Inn and I am in love!  
Keep up the good work.  We use it to guide us to places to eat locally too.
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 4
Am new to TripAdvisor.  Have found the App useful, especially the reviews.  Not sure why it dumps me back at the beginning of my search...probably inadvertently tapping something, but not sure.  Other than having to start over a couple of times, have enjoyed using App very much.  Thanks for making it free!
Version 5.93 2012-03-13 4
E only reason I did not give this app five stars is mainly because I haven't used it to travel yet. I am currently planning a trip for our girls weekend out after our deployment so it's very very helpful with comparison in prices, hundreds of hotel choices with their information, things to do in or around those hotels, etc. The pictures are very helpful.
Version 5.9 2011-12-21 5
I have been using Tripadvisor to plan my travels since 2006.  I have incorporated the recommendations in trips to Playa del Carmen, Cabo San Lucas, Spain, Chicago, New York, Munich, Boston, Miami, North Carolina, San Francisco, Memphis, and many others.  I have NEVER been disappointed!!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 5
I was skeptical of TA at first. The more i study it and use it, the more value i see in it.  Excellent. There is a glitch in the filter sort field in the iPhone version however. The "tours" and "attractions" fields do not separate properly.  Otherwise it's a handy tool for mobile ranking info.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-14 5
Planning a trip somewhere I've never been and enjoying to helpful info and the many comments from people who have made the same trip. The communities / forums really make this an all around excellent travel app and website.
Version 5.8 2011-08-15 5
I downloaded the app for a trip out of town and the reviews were awesome! It helped me choose things to do and places to eat based off of the location.
I have also used it in my home town and actually found some really cool restaurants that I didn't know existed! 
It was worth the download!!!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-15 1
I reviewed the Semiahmoo Resort in Washington State and was emailed by Trip Advisor stating that the hotel thought my review was fake. In light of this, TA removed my review without talking to me. I would have provided my receipt as proof.

After talking with other reviewers, I have learned they too had reviews removed for the same reasons. 

How neutral can TA be if they remove reviews the minute a reviewed vendor complains? The just shows they work for the vendors who pay or their site and app.

So don't be fooled by the great reviews you see, they are most likely skewed!
Version 6.6 2013-02-05 5
This is a worthwhile app that takes an incredible website and turns it into a more general tool for researching vacation information. I appreciate the simple format and limited options; it keeps the app from being clunky and slow.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-22 5
Used to be my most used app, but now it's a pain to find hotels when searching a geographical location.  I now have to enter numerous towns and do numerous searches to find what I'm looking for.  New version is a step in wrong direction.
Version 6.6 2013-04-10 5
Something must have changed with this app? I like it, and never did before. It's very user friendly, easy to say if a review was helpful and to write a review. Is that is what is new? The ability to write reviews on the app?? It's great, whenever on my iPad will use the app over the website.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 5
I traveled across country with my kids and was used Trip Advisor for hotels, restaurants, and Things to do.  Reviews were accurate and up to date.  The map was helpful in pointing me to locations, as well as providing addresses to input into my GPS navigation system.
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 5
I have had this app for 3 days.  I have managed to find hotel reservations in 3 cities restaurants on a business trip on the spur of the moment and have done each of these things in seconds!  Thank you for making it so wonderfully easy to see pricing and make reservations around the world.
Version 5.7 2011-08-08 5
This app gets good reviews in your hands quickly. Many reviews are useful and there aren't any I've seen that are all caps or completely abbreviated spelling.
Use it as write your own reviews to help others out!
The maps work great and it is a stable app - no crashing.
Version 5.7 2011-07-05 5
We find TA helpful in so many ways each day of a trip. We read customer reviews, which tell us crucial details! We knew so many features to our room in Moab, Utah, that we felt like we had stayed there before upon our arrival! Thank you, Trip Advisor!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-07 4
We frequently use TA to find the best rated hotels, great reading the reviews from members. Restaurant reviews aldo reliable. Best of all is the Forum. Before any trip i go thru the postings and topics for the areas and then cut and paste comments into our own specialized travel guide. Great place to get answers re airports , stations, hotels, trains, itineraries....
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 1
Great app for reviewing and researching. However, the first time I  used it to actually book a flight, my attitude changed. Got the flight info, put in personal and payment info and got to the final stage. When it asked me if I want to become a Trip Advisor member and I went to review privacy policy and terms/conditions it took me to a new screen with no way to go back to my previous page. I had to start over, and I hate to waste time. Something so basic and the developers/testers didn't catch this. Makes me wonder what other details they missed. Very disappointed.
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
I use this App for personal and business. When I want to share with others what hotel we are staying at I have to leave the app and search the hotel and THEN email a link. Having a share option would be great
Thank you for a real nice way to find hotels and restaurants !
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 4
Very few issues with crashing. A stable app. Easily laid out. I would prefer if I could access my reviews through it though. You can access "my saves" so if you'd like access to your reviews you would have to add your reviews to that for access in one place it seems.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 5
I travel quite a bit and use this app almost daily while on the road. I cannot remember a time when the reviews by other travelers has let me down and lured me into and establishment not worthy of my time and money. This is a must have for 'road warriors'...
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 4
Nice ap for the iPad platform. Finding restaurants within waking distance of one's hotel while traveling in France becomes painless (as long as one has Internet access) using the "nearby"  feature to locate possible options. Credibility of user reviews is a trickier matter, but at least you have a list to winnow out.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-17 5
Best App I have!!! I never go and write reviews on apps but this one I had to... I travel for work so I stay at hotels constantly. This app has saved me toonnnnnnsssss of money on hotels and always helps me pick the right one. Also love it to find good food and places in the city am staying in.
Version 5.7 2011-07-26 5
I use the trip advisor app all the time while traveling and find it easy to use and readily accessible.  When I find a new place to rate, it takes only a day or two for the trip advisor people to 'open I up' for my review.  Well done to Apple and to Trip Advisor.
Version 5.92 2012-02-08 5

Version 6.6 2013-03-15 4
The App defaults to showing hotels only, you have to figure out how to filter it on the far right of the map to show B&B's also.  It is not clear at first that this is even an option to do.  I would suggest listing all property types in the list first, then allow the user to filter out property types they don't want to see.
Version 6.1 2012-06-09 5
I love this app for vacation planning.  My husband and I are planning a trip to Spain and this app makes it so easy to find places to stay, where in town the hotel is located, reviews for these hotels and then what to do while there.  It's my number one vacation planning tool.
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 4
All the info from the full site right on your iPhone/iTouch. It would be great if "My Saves" were saved locally for offline viewing.

The gaping hole is the fact that your own reviews or activity is not accessible through the app. I knocked off a star as I find myself continuously looking for this feature.
Version 6.6 2013-01-19 5
Trip Adviser is my Go-To application to explore places to go for vacations, what to do once we get there, and where to stay.  In my opinion, no other app of its kind comes close.

The quantity of reviews on the site ensures that results aren't skewed very often by someone with a vendetta.
Version 5.7 2011-07-12 5
This is my favorite app when traveling -and I travel a lot. I use it mainly for restaurants and I like that it includes also the small towns. One has to read the reviews to identify the grains of salt but overall its a great tool for frequent travelers. I have recommended it to many colleagues.
Version 5.7 2011-08-03 5
I have to admit, at first I couldn't see where this app could offer any more than several other available apps.  The beauty of this app is how well it delivers what you're looking for.  It eclipses most airline and travel apps.  It's strength is in it's simplicity.
Version 5.9 2011-11-15 3
When you select a restaurant if you read the reviews of the restaurant you selected you get taken back to the main menu. It should allow you to go back to the list of restaurants you were browsing. It's pretty annoying and makes it frustrating to continue using. There are some good features but this is a pretty big one that NEEDS WORK! It's just as annoying as it asking you to rate the app every few mins!
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 4
I always check Trip Advisor before booking a hotel but, having the app on my iPad has made the process of searching for a place to stay so much better, I don't have to wait until I get home, I just whip out my iPad while on my lunch break or at the salon waiting or getting my hair done and get my search on for upcoming trip. Time saver!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 2
It works for finding attractions and such in a given area, but not very well. If you save an item, you can't delete it. It seems like you can, but then it doesn't work. Also if you're going through lots of pages of items, if you're on an item and you tap back, it always takes you back to the very first page of items instead of remembering which page you were on. These things are annoying enough to make me not want to use this app.
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
Trip apps are a mixed bag. This is the only one I continue to favor out of the dozen other travel apps  I have installed. I give it a five because I have never encountered a bug and it has never let me down. I use it at least weekly. And all I can say is that it is far and away the best I have used.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 1
While I am a fan and major user of Trip Advisor, this app, while pretty in design & user interface, it lacks the great content of the website. For example, while the website lists 28 hotels in Tortola, the app lists only 8 hotels, and they are different. It's as if this app were from a totally different, and obviously inferior website. To add insult to injury, the latest update now goes to Bing Maps!! Another inferior feature. What happened to Google Maps?? Don't bother downloading this app, just go to the website instead.
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
Trip advisor was nice online. Hard to believe they could have improved it much. Well, they did.  Fast, intuitive, very thorough, great pics and reservation tie ins.  
Very nicely done Trip Advisor!  You made it to the coveted home page on my pad. Full five stars!
Version 5.8 2011-10-30 5
I love Trip Advisor!  I use it regularly to locate restaurants, and check out what others think about about them, as well as hotel ratings.  I will not stay anywhere without checking with Trip Advisor first. Thanks for such a valuable service.
Version 5.8 2011-09-03 5
The TA App is great because it gives you all the most helpful info, including distance from where you are at any given time...  One click to open table reservations, one click to restaurant websites.  I highly recommend this App.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 5
We travel a great deal since we retired and are so glad that we have such a great resource as Tripadvisor. We rarely go out without consulting Tripadvisor before booking a hotel, restaurant, or tour. Tripadvisor is a must have application and I recommend it to all my friends and family.
Version 8.5 2014-03-03 5
I have been using TA for a couple of months now and have found it to be quiet accurate and informative. I have used it for restaurants/hotels and resorts and have not been disappointed. Very current information on everything!
Version 8.5 2014-03-22 5
BEST app to find reliable reviews of restaurants and hotels!  Has never led me wrong. Have found some wonderful restaurants all over the US; very comprehensive list.  Easy to use and I add to restaurants I want to go to and have been to as "saved" for my list of favorites.
Version 6.6 2012-11-25 1
The Sheraton New Orleans Club level food left much to be desired. The food was bland and not very representative of what I expected to eat in New Orleans. After all folks come here for food. I expected down home cooking and flavorful snacks instead there was raw fish, international dips and the nastiest gumbo ever. If I didn't know any better , I would swear I was I'm New York instead if New Orleans . I'm sure most people will venture outside of the hotel to eat but... For anyone who is thinking the food at club level will be worth the extra $. Think again.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-26 3
This app is laid out nicely, but has some very important features missing. Mainly the ability to star places, and share info from the app. I'm currently planning a trip but have no way to keep track of what places I like and don't like. I can't even send the info to my email from the app. That's a huge thing to be missing from an app like this.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
I just downloaded this app today, and am finding it very user-friendly!  I haven't had any problems with the links, and I love how you can connect immediately to different sites like expedia and orbitz for price information.  Thank you for such a convenient app!
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
I have been using this app for more than a year , and definitely is the best travel app in the market , is the only way to know by fellow travelers what's happening in the city your are visiting related to hotels, restaurants , tours etc.

Keep improving !!!!
Version 8.1.1 2013-12-06 5
I am a huge fan of trip advisor. I have been pleased with the advice - although you should toss out the outrageously good and bad.  I have been using the new iPad app today &amp; have found it to be very robust. The pictures on the iPad are quite good.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5
I am an avid user of tripadvisor, and now of this app. I am always checking reviews before staying at a hotel, and always leaving reviews when I can, and this app makes it even easier to take it on the go. Five stars as far as I am concerned.

senior contributor, j carter.
Version 6.4 2012-09-10 5
This is indispensable tool for traveling. I have been using it for planning and on the go. Couldn't even think what I would do without trip advisor. It never failed me with scoring. I caught myself few times ignoring the ratings and reviews and paid for it dearly. Great tool.
Version 5.8 2011-10-10 4
I usually spend so much time going from one website to the other when planning a vacation, which takes up a lot of time because I have to go back and forth between the sites and often forget what has been saved. This one allows me to save all my voices of hotels, restaurants and things to do in one site. One of, if not, the best App I have.
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 1
Once you find something of interest, I wanted to see it on the map. Now you get a lettered flag, but I did not notice the flag letter before I hit the link to see it on the map.  The search area went back to the beginning so I have to scroll thru all 296 items again to get the flag letter. Ok here we are again, I got the flag letter. Now the map is not close enough to see any details. So I have start over again from the beginning to see any others that might interest me. What a lousy, lazy program. Not enough detail to be useful. I would pick 0 stars if I could.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
The FIRST site I go to for advice on what to see and do for a city I plan on visiting. Especially when planning a quick trip. Tons of photos and info that always are spot-on for helping me quickly determine if something is right for me. It has never let me down.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
Overall Tripadvisor has been my trusted advisor on the road and I travel for a living.  This app is great with its nice clean interface and easily navigable screens you will have everything you need.  would be nice to be able to interface with IPad camera but I love this app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-06 5
Trip advisor lays out the information well. Other apps seem more interested in advertising than in delivering information. So far I have been very happy with both the layout and the targeted search capability of trip advisor.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
This app is phenomenal! A few of us used this app in an unfamiliar area 5 hours from home and were able to see and do everything in the area! Some of the things we experienced were unknown to the locals but because of trip advisor we had already seen them! :)
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-19 5
I got tired of the paid websites that only tell what hotels restaurants are there if they got paid.    Trip advisor shows them all .. Warts and all!     Easy to use    No ads fast response even with photos.   Everywhere from up north Wisconsin to Christchurch New Zealand.
Version 6.6 2013-03-23 5
good easy to use site with intuitive apps.  Use it all the time for domestic (US) and international travel.  You may find some sites with more detail, but this is always where I start and go from there. Good support and knowledgeable people in the forums too!
Version 6.3 2012-07-19 5
I use TripAdvisor religiously when planning travel.  I now use the TripAdvisor app almost exclusively as it seems to be easier to use than the actual website for most items.  Highly recommended!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 4
Excellent travel app, and I really appreciate the saved items feature. I rate it 4/5 stars because it doesn't seem to have a way to link with your online trip advisor account - so what I save on my phone stays on my phone. I can't access it from other devices . If I'm wrong, someone please post the way to do this - Im all ears!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 2
It's nice that you can look up almost everything you need to in one app, but when it comes to looking up said items, this app is so slow and at time unresponsive. I catch myself EVERY TIME trying to scroll through pictures of hotels and it just won't scroll. The arrows aren't even responsive. And when I press done I have to wait for it to go back to the previous screen if it even does that. Please fix this. It's really annoying.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-21 5
I just can't book a hotel or visit a new restaurant anymore without checking them out first on TripAdvisor. Essential. Excellent. Empowers us, the once never-heard nor cared for individuals! Suggestion: Needs to include rental car companies
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
Found very nice restaurants in NY, LA, Sedona or in Europe. Got reviews for nice restaurants in Phoenix and tried them out
Found things to do in Sydney and Europe. 
I don't know all travel apps out there, but this one is reeeally helpful.
There should be a 5+ category for the best of the best and this one would be there!!!
Version 6.2 2012-06-26 3
The app is nice in that you can access the site quickly, but I find the app is missing several options available on their Internet site. For example, once you type in a location, you can choose hotel, rental properties, etc on their Internet site, but the app does not allow the same function. When I tried searching on the app, it didn't give nearly the same depth of search.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-27 5
My favorite feature so far is that if you find a location on the map, it will show all the hotels nearby. Or you can locate your hotel, and the switch over to get reviews for all the nearby restaurants. Very useful when traveling.
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5
I love everything about this app. You can narrow down your searches, read reviews and view pics from people who have traveled before you. If you use this app to book a trip, make sure to add reviews and pics to help others like you!

Trip Advisor rocks!
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
TripAdvisor is a wonderful page.  It offers great mostly unbiased advice.  The reviews are truly helpful and the amount of data from everywhere makes it really valuable

Well, the APp is all of this and maybe even more, given the great ipad interface.

I really recommend it
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 5
By far, The TripAdvisor app and website are both my most used for travel info and advice.  Never book a hotel without looking up reviews and always find best restaurants and attractions nearby while on travel using this app.
Version 8.5 2014-03-29 5
We recently spent 4 days in NYC. With hundreds of restaurants within hundred feet of our hotel, the NEAR ME NOW feature on this APP was crucial. It saved so much time on picking a great place eat and that is just one of the many great features on this great travel APP. Thanks GW
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 4
You can rarely go completely wrong using the advise of others but often others have different standards or expectations.  Learning the users tastes  would obviously be the best but even simple demo, recency or type of trip filters would take this service to the next level.
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 5
TripAdvisor is always a first choice. I find their reviews to be reliable as well as their flight options. A personal feature favorite: the ability to peruse flight costs for months in advance to compare and contrast.
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 5
this app was the ideal tools to search the area I was in by shrinking the map to the area of interest and finding what I wanted.  Now I must filter through the entire city, which makes this now an unusable app.  Is there a way I can uninstall the upgrade please?
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 5
We travel the world a lot and this is the perfect app to help us identify restaurants and hotels. We find it far more useful and up to date than the guide Michelin. We have found the reviews all very useful and accurate. I would strongly recommend it
Version 5.8 2011-08-17 5
I downloaded this app for a vacation and found it invaluable. It steered me away from some of the places I was tempted to try and I ended up enjoying the many things people's reviews led me to. TA has quickly become one of my favorite apps!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
I needed something like Google places and wow has this delivered and then some. What is there no to love? The layout is great. Easy to use. Even clicking on websites to attractions keeps you inside the trip advisor app. This is the type of app that all other apps wish they could be. Fantastic!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 1
Long time user....very disappointed, so much that I'm looking around for a new app.   Just spent an hour trying to find things to do in Prague and the surfing within app is a nightmare.  I think the developers have tried to get too smart and slick, and now we have an app that is over baked and unintuitive.  I loved what TA was, but   This is not an upgrade, sorry developers, massive FAIL on this forced upgrade.   Endless loops of information and maps that are constantly resetting because the app is trying to anticipate what I want and auto filter...so annoying!!
Version 6.6 2013-01-07 5

Version 8.4 2014-02-16 1
Dear tripadvisor,

If you're wondering why all of your traveler photos are from 2010 and prior, it's bc your photo submission software is outdated. You only allow 5mb per picture which is too small for 20mp cameras in 2014 and in itself unnecessary. Follow Facebook, Flickr and other sites that automatically compress large photos to optimize, the result being very small files that are more than sufficient for viewing on your site. Also make it easier to post from the app. Too many errors.
Version 6.5 2012-09-17 5
I've visited many great restaurants and tourist sites, and several B&B's and hotels, based on the reliable user reviews. I have actually reviewed places in 3 different countries, as well as in my own area. Excellent app. A must have for travelers.
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 5
I use Yelp a lot and came across this app recently. Excellent comments from road warriors like me. 
I will cross check the two apps and know for sure I'm landing at a great spot visited by those in the know!
Big thumbs up!
Bob G
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Since I have used this app we have enjoyed unique restaurants near Boston and Myrtle Beach.   I don't like to use chain restaurants very often so some of the positive reviews for them are curious.   Great way to get to know about really good places.
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
My wife and I were searching for a hotel while traveling up the I-75 towards Tennessee and this app was all I needed to quickly search for a hotel at a great price, read consumer reviews and check availability. Highly recommended for the iPhone 4.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
This is my go-to app when on the road for business or pleasure. Great functionality with a huge amount of user-derived content make this a must-have app for anyone who travels frequently! How did we manage before TA?
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 5
This is a great resource to have. I like road trips and to try different places. It's great to research ahead of time, but the road often doesn't take you where you intended. Its nice to find good eats and places to stay on the fly. Be honest as you would want to read a review.
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
I'm a big fan trip advisor in general and this app stays true to the helpfulness I love from them. The only thing I would suggest would be to not have the reviews under a drop down menu. That's what you're known for and it took me a while to find them!
Version 5.92 2012-02-15 5
I got hooked on TA when planning trips to disney and San francisco. Got iPad for Christmas 2011 and discovered the TA ap. it is great and functions much like online version. I especially like that you can click on websites of places reviewed and then simply click the button to go back to TA.
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-11 5
This is a awesome application, from comparing flight prices to hotel reviews it truly make a difference. I am currently planing a trip to Orlando with my girlfriend before I ship out to Basic Military Training, and it save a lot of time. Keep up the good work guys!
Version 8.5 2014-03-27 5
I've liked this site for some time and with this cross country move I keep discovering just how great
the app is. Allows you to find great restaurants and hotels nearby and read others reviews before you go.
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 4
The app works well, easy to use, interesting reading -- the juxtaposition of contradictory reviews is amusing.  Need to recognize that the folks who tend to write rviews are either very pleased or very unhappy with their experiences.  I'm planning an extended vacation and this app is helping me get a handle on what I can see and, and where I can eat while on the road.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
Excellent ap!  Love the searching by price or ratings feature, all the reviews, and the "saves". Only improvements I'd suggest are keeping the prices as updated as possible, showing them whenever possible, showing on the map, and having more links to sites where bookings can be made.
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
We have been on the road for several days and was happy to find app after visiting the website checking reviews. We have used it every day since finding it. It is a great help to have the map available immediately for your selection. 
Good job!
Version 6.0 2012-03-16 5
Tried out trip advisor on my trip to Hawaii last Christmas and found all the out-of-the-way places frequented by locals.  Since then, I have used it on all my trips and am using it to plan out our trip to Europe this summer! Wonderful app! Recommend it to all my friends!
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 4
Love to use this while traveling. The reviews are helpful, however some people are much more picky than me, complaining about every little thing. I take it with a grain of salt, because some people have cups half empty and some just plain can't even find their cup! Used all week with success in Kauai. Aloha!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 3
I like the app but it has some bugs that are annoying, when I do a search and then refine the search it limits the options of filtering for distance or rating and I have to then do a new search to get the other to work, also when I go into a specific restaurant then go back out to the search page it takes me back out to the wrong search,
Needs work to be as good as it could be.
Version 5.4 2011-02-25 5
One one my favorite websites is also an app.  We always enjoy researching restaurants and hotels for places we go on the website.  Now we can do it on our phones with the added bonus of having the phone's GPS search your immediate area and give you directions.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 4
I have enjoyed the features of TripAdvisor.  The multi option hotel reservations feature is great. The only disappointing feature is missing price range for the restaurants. I went to City Range steak house grill and it was over priced for the amount of food. The reviews did warn me of the service but I did have good service.
Version 6.6 2013-02-16 3
Really love this app. A great help to find attractions and hotels in the place I intend to go. Just wondering why, these 3 days there's "No internet connection" notification everytime I use the app, while I browse on Safari and playing games very smoothly, so I guess no problem with my internet connection. Is there anyone experiencing the same with me? I'm using ipod 4th with ios 6. Thank you:)
Version 8.3 2014-02-23 4
Been staying here for many years. Many ups and downs. I think they are on an up cycle.  Room was clean and comfortable. Housekeeping should ,however, pay a little more attention to making the bed. (Very lumpy)

Breakfast was good. I did miss the omlet station.

Special thanks to Jaime and Maria of their always great service.
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 5
I'm used to making set of browser bookmarks when we go on trips.  Trip advisor does a lot of the work for you.  It compiles information on attractions based on interests.  I found it very useful for planning site visits by distance and location.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
I used this app to assist me in planning my family vacation. I found it very useful in finding not only a great hotel, but also lots of family oriented things to do on our trip to San Francisco. Much easier to navigate then just searching the web. Great job.
Version 6.6 2013-01-24 5
The Trip Advisor app is perfect for trip planning!  You can search hotels, restaurants, and things to do; save what you like; and it will plot everything on a map.  Links to websites, photos, reviews, everything you need to make planning a trip easy!
Version 6.6 2012-11-25 4
Used the app to plan a trip to Costa Rica for our first time.  Got some great hotels at the coast & in the mountains.  The reviews were most valuable both in selecting accommodation & restaurants.  Have not been disappointed yet. The app is much better than the web witch I stopped using due to speed & limited features.
Version 8.2 2013-12-14 5
I always find some great suggestions here on where to go out to eat - or what attractions are nearby. Planning a trip is so much more enjoyable when you have TripAdvisor's information at hand!
Version 6.6 2012-12-31 5
I never stay or eat anywhere without first checking with Trip Advisor. This app is great. Sure-you can ask the locals where to eat while you're out of town, but this app gives you a lot more information so you can make an educated decision.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 5
I love to use tripadvisor for creating a wish list of all the places people recommend. Takes the guess work out of traveling. Would be even better if it proved an online travel agent for even more personalized experience.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-11 5
My wife and I typically buy package deals (airfare, hotel, sometime car as well) when we travel internationally.  TripAdvisor hasn't let us down!  We've traveled all over the UK as well as Italy, The Czech Republic, and France!  Thanks TripAdvisor - We count on you!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-27 5
I have used this app camping, backpacking, taking out clients or traveling abroad. Quick and easy to use with recommendations from every day people sharing their experiences. Get it if you don't already ave this in your "tool box".
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5
Have used for travel all over the world with great results. Especially good for out of the way places and not the Disney/Hilton, etc requirement. For example it's great to find a local hotel in Saigon with a room for 2 adults and 2 children or a great elephant experience in Chiangmai.
Version 8.3.1 2014-03-26 5
Used the app to find things to do in Miami beach. I have 5 kids 10-2 yrs old. This app was a god send. Found lots to do . The duck tour in Miami beach was amazing. Kids had a blast. The info on the app was correct could call direct and the directions were right on.! Great job on this app !!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 5
Wherever I go, this app has become my main source when planing a trip, from hotels, to restaurants, to things to do, this app makes traveling cost and time more valuable!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-27 5
I've been a trip advisor for a few years, but I hadn't downloaded the app yet. It functions well, and it's much more user friendly than going through the website. The app will undoubtably get me to review more places due to its ease of use.
Version 6.0 2012-03-25 5
A solid app that makes using Trip Advisor quick and easy on the iDevices.  Quality of reviews is general good, but as with any app like this you need to become savvy to disregard the outliers.   Very useful , would leave home without it
Version 6.6 2013-01-10 5
We go on vacation at least once a year if not twice. You are foolish if you do not use this app for planning your vacation. I love the Things to Do as well. I use this app everyday for about 5 weeks before I leave for vacation, the photos and the reviews are awesome!
Version 6.6 2013-01-24 5
I have been to Paris once before, it means nothing. My first language is English.,trip advisor is really helping me decide on my place to stay on my next trip to Paris. I have been reading the reviews, Thank You past visitors........ Thank You.
Version 8.3 2013-12-29 5
When we are traveling, trip advisor is my go to reference for where to eat and thing to see. In our travels, we appreciate good food. Not the most expensive, but good unique local eateries.  I use trip advisor before trips and it is very useful during trips.
Version 6.2 2012-07-02 5
When looking to go somewhere, I always check TripAdvisor out to read what people have to say. Went to Virginia Beach for the first time last year. Thanks everyone for your reviews had an awesome time...going back again this year. Linda from MA
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 5
Trip Advisor is spectacular! Not only do they provide great assistance in planning trips, eating out and so much else, but they also provide a secondary vacation by allowing me to review deeply the adventures I have had, providing fantastic psychic vacations!
Version 5.6 2011-06-22 5
Very easy to use and provides the traveler with great information. Real photos of what you can expect when you arrive, not the misleading commercial shots. Honest feedback from others who have been there is just as helpful as a referral from a friend.
Version 6.4 2012-09-01 5
I used this app for a long time.  It is always very helpful in finding hotels or hostels, things to do, and restaurants. I am sure it has saved me lots of money.  I truly appreciate other reviewers comments when I am in a new place.
Version 6.3 2012-07-12 1
Bing maps ruins this app, the updates are taking the app in the wrong direction.  Why on earth do they continue to insist on bing maps...I bought an iPad not a dopey Surface...is tripadvisor owned by MSFT, that is the only reason I can think of as to why they would continue down this obviously dubios path...if they continue to use bing maps after apple releases their new maps functionality I'll just delete all together, never come back, and use the several other travel apps that actually have their acts together.
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
I often check travel-related sites before going on a trip, just to get ideas of where to eat or stay and what to avoid.  Over the past year or so I have been spending more time using Tripadvisor and less time with some of the other apps. Get it! Use it!
Version 6.6 2013-03-25 4
I downloaded this app to submit a couple of quick reviews on hotels that we stayed at on our anniversary trip. One was favorable, the other, not so much. So far, the app is adequate for that purpose, but I cannot find options to rate individual details like quality of sleep, etc.
Version 6.6 2013-04-01 5
TripAdvisor, what would we do without you ?
Great app. Thanks !

Only recommendation: sites you get to through clicking on embedded links (restaurants or hotels) should be on Safari or another browser, not embedded.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 4
Access to My Trip Advisor to view my saved trip itinerary would make this app much more useful to me for traveling. However, overall very fast searches. To those complaining that the database is out of date, reviews are posted by users so start posting some reviews of places in your town and hopefully others will do the same!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
I'm always amazed how many good user reviews are available, even when you're just about in the middle of nowhere. The app is simple and fast... just as it should be when you're trying to find a place to call home on the road.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
This upgrade is terrible and makes the app 95% useless. Google Maps cover small towns in Vietnam, Peru and Rwanda. Bing doesn't even cover Shanghai. They might as well have scrapped maps altogether because now the pins are just scattered around a useless blob instead of pointing to, you know, STREETS. They switched the full Tripadvisor site to Bing maps too... Stupid move Tripadvisor, very stupid move. I'll just use Kayak to book my hotels now instead since their maps actually show the hotel's location (what a concept!)
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
Works great. You can save things that would like to do on your trip including restaurants and then look at them on a map. Wish they would make the pins for restaurants a different color so they would stand out from attractions. But still awesome!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 4
I find the App pretty straightforward and seemingly accurate 95% of the time.
I just clicked on "Nearby Attractions" here where I live on Marco Island and was directed to a small island 900 miles away in the Carribean.
It just makes me wonder sometimes about just how the application comes up with something so out of Whack...
Version 5.6 2011-06-25 5
I have always gone to TripAdvisor for candid reviews, and advise from locals. Now, this app takes it to high gear. I find it very intuitive and the layout gives a lot of info without being too cluttered. Thanks for this excellent travel app. I highly recommend it!
Version 6.6 2013-08-18 5
Lots of information on hotels, restaurants, and things to do and see in tourist destinations. I've relied on the information provided by others on this side and so far I have gotten nothing but good advice. I like how they have rankings. That helps in deciding.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 2
I do not like this forced upgrade app.
The old app worked wayyy better.
Example, I am trying to find a hotel near the SFO airport and it gives me either that does not exist or some where in Italy. 
There is no  way to sign into my account to give a review of a property or restaurant.
You would think the iPad version wold be a step up and not backwards. 
Hopefully the next revision will bring back the old functionality or I'll have to just go back to using the website on my laptop.
Version 5.92 2012-01-24 5
The subject says it all. TA is a resource we continually go back to for the kind of help we are looking for in our self-directed/styled traveling approach. 
The real time and real people reviews and advice establish parameters for the where, how tos and caution are fabulous.
Version 6.2 2012-06-16 5
This ap delivers what you've come to expect from the traditional online version used on your desktop. Location services with GPS will let you locate nearby food and lodging. I haven't experienced any problems.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-24 5
This is my go to app whenever I travel. The "near me now" button is wonderful. I am never disappointed in the reliability of the reviews. I feel like the highly rated reviews are the kind of places that I tend to seek out when I go to a new place. Thanks TripAdvisor.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
I have used several apps and sites over the years to find places to stay when traveling for work. This is by far the best app for finding places to stay and eat when traveling. The reviews and pictures are very helpful.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Finding kid-friendly hotels and restaurants with extensive vegetarian menus used to be a challenge when away from home, but with my Tripadvisor app, it's a cinch. The reviews  and recommendations have never steered me wrong. Great app!
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 5
I think this one of the few apps that has nearly everything you need to completely plan a trip from your iPhone. Did I mention it is FAST? I have only a few other apps that work as fast as this one, I would hands down recommend it based on speed alone
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 4
I really like it most of the time.  Like having reviews of places we're not familiar with.  The only complaint I have is not being able to find campgrounds very well on this app.  We camp more than do hotels, and it's easier to find those surfing the web than the app.  It's still a useful app though!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
I really enjoy hearing what other reviewers think of the different places. I also really like the ability to add my own thoughts and experiences so others can choose to enjoy or avoid according to my review.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
I just downloaded the app an hour ago and already decided this is going to by source of travel info. Complete with maps, ratings and all relevant details needed for travel. Well designed and easy to use. Thank you, Tripadvisor!
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
Any time I need to get pertinent and quality information on a place I will be visiting I  come to trip advisor.  I know I can trust these reviews and when I go some place I try to put up my own reviews so it's a give and take relationship.
Version 6.6 2012-12-31 5
This is a great app to have if you are planning at rip it shows you everything you need to know about where you are planning to visit it shows you restaurants things to do attractions hotel prices what more can you ask for need to have app.
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 5
When traveling away from home don't leave lodging and dining to chance. Seek the experiences and comments of those before you first then make your own conclusions.  This is a very good and reliable resource.
Version 6.6 2013-02-26 5
Has been ever so helpful in helping me plan various vacations around the US. Suggests lots of little places I would have missed. And thanks to everyone who travels and is kind enough to leave a review and pics of your travels :) this app is nothing without the tourists
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-27 5
Planning your stays in unfamiliar cities is much easier with this tool.  I have found the reviews extremely helpful in avoiding unnecessary high prices when so much excellence exists for affordable prices.
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 5
I love the fact that I can save spots and see photos of everything.

My only complaint is that when you look at some place/point of interest and then press "back" you go to the zoomed out map, not the zoom position you were previously
Version 6.6 2012-12-21 5
We use this app when traveling because of its ease of navigating through options and because I won't stay anywhere unless we check out the Tripadvisor ratings on the place.  We haven't been disappointed using this approach.
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
Enjoying using Trip Advisor as the reviews have so far been right on point. As a consumer it's certainly helpful to know that an unbiased review is actually  available.  We don't consider a hotel or restaurant without first checking with Trip Advisor.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 4
For lodging and food, tripadvisor's up to the minute reviews give you confidence traveling anywhere. iPhone interface makes finding good places when you're hungry easy.

One problem with the interface is it requires Internet connectivity to use, even to access saved items. That needs to change.
Version 5.93 2012-03-12 4
Used this on different trips now and it's very helpful for finding places to go and to avoid.   Watch the dates on the reviews;  sometimes the quality changes with management. You can look at bad reviews but they're all 3 years old and more recent reviews are more positive. Seem it go both ways with this. Great ver helpful app.
Version 5.9 2012-09-23 5
La Concha was a wonderful hotel, the rooms were modern and clean and the staff was wonderful, especially Carlos Cabret!  He was so informed and helpful.  He made my stay especially memorable!  It takes a great staff to make a great hotel & he is certainly a great staff member!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 5
There is so many great things to do I have discovered thanks to this app. Even places close to me. The reviews section is also a great tool because you get feedback and recommendations from people that has already been there.
Version 5.8 2011-10-13 5
This app is a great tool!  I wish that I has used it to read the reviews on some of the restaurants prior to visiting the establishment. Now that I have this app, I am previewing reviews. Most of the time reviewers are correct but sometimes it may have just not been a good night. Thanks Travel Advisor!
Version 5.92 2012-02-15 5
Very easy to use, no confusing run arounds in this app. Everything you need to know about the area you are in or where you are going all in the palm of your hand. You can even save places that you liked or want to check out. Everyone should download this app.
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 5
Rarely use the website anymore as the app is so much better! Great travel advice and when you enter a place the practical aspects hotels, restaurants and attractions quickly pop up so you can get an idea of whether it's worth visiting  or not.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
The Trip Advisor App is sooooo helpful!  It is great with directions and suggestions on things to do at your destination.
Couldn't do without it!
We Have used it recently on trips to Cambodia and to France for hotels, B and B's and restaurants.  The suggestions were "right on" and saved us lots of research time.
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 4
This is one of my favorite apps for any kind of information before traveling. The ratings are usually spot-on and can save loads of time searching for info on other apps or websites. I have noticed the improvement of this app since it was introduced and it keeps getting even more useful with each update! Trip Advisor is essential!!
Version 5.9 2011-11-08 5
I used trip advisor for my trip to NYC.. Hadn't been there since I was in grade school... The maps,reviews,pictures and did I say the MAPS!! Cool feature that lets you walk around with your iPhone and  it actually walks around NYC or wherever you're researching... Bye bye Kayak...
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-02 3
Do use it all the time for home and travel But you better call the place before you visit. They have a place listed for my town that has been closed out is service no longer there how ever you want to say it for over 15 years. Have written 2 reviews about it but they still have not pulled the posting which ales this old an madder than hell. Just remover to call first .
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
Overall this app is great. This was great for locating hotels, restaurants, and activities. I did not use it to book my hotel since it was slightly confusing but I did find one for a good price in a good area. Planning activities was a breeze even on a budget. I would definitely suggest it to anyone planning a trip in an unknown area.
Version 6.6 2012-09-29 4
Trip advisor is our go-to site before all of our travels - domestic and international.  The app for the iPad however is terrible. It crashes frequently and resets to obscure locations when switching tabs from hotels to things to do to restaurants.  Stay on the web page and away from the iPad app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 5
I always use this app when I'm out of town , or when a friend in a near by town asks us out to dinner - I'm always checking the ratings ! Just got back from Nevada and of course used the app to point me to a good restaurant - things to do etc. *****
Version 5.7 2011-08-22 5
We always use this app while traveling (iPhone too.) nothing beats honest reviews from fellow travelers. 1 tip, read through some of the negative reviews before you write something off, sometime people give a bad grade for no good reason.
Version 6.3 2012-07-22 5
We just got back from a three night trip up north and a three night trip back.  We used Trip Advisor's ratings for all the hotels we picked to stay.  We were very satisfied.  It really came in handy. No telephone number for the hotels, but that was okay.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 5
This is my go-to whenever we're on vacation, traveling for work, or just out and about town. Especially after "Where do you wanna go?" -- "I don't know where do you wanna go?" Happens for 20 minutes!!  Thanks to the handy locator, ideas, and reviews!
Version 6.6 2012-10-10 2
It took me about 10 mins to figure out how to go back, as I assumed the back button was for the left column. The app doesn't save searches, or persist where I was last time. I also can't get to the zoom level I want on the map. Performance is not great on my gen 3 iPad. I can't view a long enough list of hotel results, because I can't hide the map. Please switch to native maps and use more standard navigation patterns so this app is easier to use.
Version 5.91 2012-01-18 5
Love how easy to use and simple, maybe they could add other option with the search  e.g.  Be able to have a different departing of returning date for other people in your travel without having to do another individual search.
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 5
Whether your a travel abound in the great unknown looking for a good bite to eat or in your local hometown this app has something useful for you. Love it. I use it all the time now to find great places. Even found some places I never knew existed all this time.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 4
Very handy app for planning a trip. So far the only thing I don't like is the "back" button. If you have been reading reviews it will go back to each review instead of the previous menu. When I am done reading reviews I want to go back to the search menu and I have to tap back a dozen times to get there.
Version 6.2 2012-07-22 5
This website has helped on every trip we've planned. Love the reviews by "regular" people like us. It's nice to have a perspective from the actual travelers and not just what's on the hotels website. Having photos taken by people that have stayed there is so great!
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 4
The app works fine. I've only been working with it for a couple of weeks. A couple of things I noticed that could be improved are:
1) the tool does not work with the gyroscope, and
2) it gives results of flight searches fixed outbound and inbound pairs of flights which makes searching a little slower.
Version 8.5 2014-03-28 5
This is my favourite app. It gives me honest and helpful tips from people who have already been there. I never choose hotels when traveling without it. I have found some gems that I would not have otherwise.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-14 5
Tripadvisor is a great resource. Very helpful and insightful. I always use the app to write reviews myself. It's simple to use. I recommend the app (and website) if you travel often. I use it almost everyday!! I definitely recommend it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-16 5
I feel most of the reviews are from folks like me who give their honest opinion.  We use Trip Advisor and check out everything and place we are going!

I wish there was a way to contract trip advisor.  I am awaiting 3 trip tags...
Version 5.8 2011-10-25 5
This is a wonderful app on the iPad. Interactive, fast, always updated, basically all pertinent info about your city, hotel, flight etc all at your fingertips.  I highly recommend TripAdvisor as a favorite weblink or an app!
Version 6.4 2012-09-18 5
You can easily get overwhelmed with planning a trip. The trip adviser app is very user-friendly.  It always helps me to sort different activities based on reviews and assist with planning expectations, and wonderful experiences on my trips!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-12 5
Love how easy it is to navigate. There may be only a few places listed for each local but you know they were worth someone taking the time to submit a review, that says something in & of itself. As more folks use it, it will fill up.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 4
Perfect fir what I need. Let's me view everything that I can on the main site, with better navigation. I am planning a trip to Germany in November, and this has proved invaluable for finding advice on hotels, train tickets, bus tickets and information about anything Europe (should I decide to travel outside Germany!) Good job.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-13 5
When visiting a new area I will go to this app to see where to eat and stay. I love to do review because I know it helps fellow travelers. I feel everyone is honest in their reviews and tell the good and the bad. Keep the reviews coming. Also add pictures since so easy to do.
Version 8.5 2014-03-13 5
We rely on Trip Advisor when traveling a lot and feel confident in the information we receive. We have had many good experiences using their rating system and apparently unbiased reviews. Thanks for this service!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-19 3
We love the TripAdvisor community. Its members are the strength of this website. That being said, the app does not allow you to submit reviews due to a glitch (depriving TA of valuable submissions).  You can compose a review, but when you try to submit it, you get a "must log in" error, even though you are logged in.  There is an option to log in again but this does not work.
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 5
My family just went parasailing on Wednesday June 27, 2012 and had a blast! The owners were very considerate of my family and the captain and his crew of the blue boat were really fun! I recommend capt mickeys! Will definitely sail with them again.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
I check TA for EVERY trip I take whether business or vacay. If you take time to go through all the reviews of a place, you'll get a good idea of what it's like. App is easy to navigate, connects with online TA account. Love it. (works best on wifi)
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 5
Just looked at the Trip Advisor App for iPad and found some
 excellent places to try within a two second walk from my apartment. I am so excited.
I think that TA is a fantastic source of so much good information. I plan all my trips withbit.
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
I aleays find myself surfing the net on my phone and ending up at the Trip Advisor site, before realizing I have the app. Very convenient. I'd like to see a section about transportation: bus, subway, cab availability and prices would be helpful.
Version 6.6 2012-11-19 5
Small space, but amazing taste! We went at 4:45pm and it was incredibly family friendly and completely empty. We ordered the guacamole, which was AMAZING. We also shared the mole chicken and beef tenderloin fajitas and they were out-of-this-world. What a jewel in Taos!!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-26 5
Really love this app, especially on the go! It gives you a run down of all the best things a locale has to offer. Found that their hotel searches also gives you a breakdown of the best competitive rates offered online-saved me $ & time!
Version 6.1 2012-06-05 5
Your travel experience start at the moment that you click the trip advisor icon, and definitely helps you, through the experience of thousands of people to make the best out of your trips, thanks for these great tool
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 3
Trying this app for the first time in Kiev, the locations identified are good, but the mapping interface does not work well.  Current location is found, but many top rated sites won't come up on the map, so there is no way to get directions, determine relative distance from current location, etc.  All that being said, this app is definitely a valuable tool that will get even better w time.
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 4
The trip advisor app is superb. Concise and convenient is the best one can say.  Even for those who may be skeptical about the objectivity of it's reviews. Considering it's with you all of the time ad is your phone. Who knows when you'd use this handy app.  An unexpected diversion to a strange city or a last minute business trip.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-06 5
This app is incredibly helpful in searching for hotels in nearby areas (haven't searched anything international yet) and I appreciate the many reviews as well as the ability to save my favorite hotels and see pricing on most!
Version 5.8 2011-08-11 5
This app is very easy to search for hotels and narrow down what you are looking for. We were able to search for only hotels in the French quarter and loved being able to see personal photos and review of the hotels. Can't wait to plan our next trip.
Version 7.1 2013-07-17 5
Trip Advisor is a great website. We use it all the time to check places for vacation. Now it's even better as an App!  Its great to have it at hand to check out restaurants or tourist attractions while you're on the road.

It also helps to be able write a review on-site.
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 4
I've used the Trip Advisor website for years to help plan trips and select restaurants near home and during travel, and now with the App I can access the great reviews any where. It's a great feature to be able to see what others are saying about a restaurant, attraction, or service while I'm away. Great App.
Version 5.6 2011-06-22 5
Starting looking for activities for our trip to DR..and all of sudden A Trip Advisor app appeared. This is awesome,simple to use, love the interactive maps, and photos look stunning with the slide show feature. Thanks Trip Advisor, you've done it again!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-20 2
We have dined many times at the Paradise Beach Grill in Capitola. We had never been disappointed until tonight. Our waiter served other customers that were seated after us and even acknowledged the fact with a meager apology (twice). One time he spent so much time with another customer our filets were left to dry out under their heating lamp. They had a piano player that sang, but all It did was raise the decibels with customers needing to yell to be heard.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 5
I am a frequent reviewer and find this a reliable tool for finding, or double checking places I've found on other sites. I do have problems adding travel articles due to a glitch between TA and IE. Valuable since we travel 365 days a year.
Version 6.0 2012-03-24 1
The app is merely a wrapper for their web site.   Not only it does not behave like a native app, which could be ignored, if t was not for every operation as simple as sorting requiring a trip to the server.   Navigating here is just impossible, specially when you are on the road with poor connectivity.

In some cases, tapping in features does nothing, hard to tell what failed.   Tapping on things repeatedly is the only solution.    

No way to login globally across invocations either.

The service is still great, just use a desktop to access
Version 8.3 2014-01-03 5
I've used this app almost exclusively to find places to stay while traveling the country. Download this app and then add to the community by adding reviews and insights to help other travelers. Ride safe! Travel far!
Version 6.4 2012-08-29 3
I have reservations at trattoria dal cavalier gino, ( highly recommended by locals), and wished to map it in trip advisor...
nope no can do... the APP tells me that the restaurant doesn't exist in Rome...YET, if one goes to the Ta web site, struggles through the " search" 
engine ... sure enough, there it is... 4.5 stars and all.... also, would be great if the app offered directions between saved sites...
Version 8.5 2014-03-02 5
I'm planning a trip to France after lots of success using tripadvisor for trip to UK last year.  I have done tons of research and planning on my computer and the app now has all my saved places!  Looking forward to adding my ratings as I visit...

We are currently vacationing and using the app. We went on two of the recommended tours, BioIsland PR (fabulous electric boat tour of bio bay  in Fajardo) and Flavor (wonderful walking and culinary tour in Old San Juan). I would and do recommend this application to any traveler.
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 5
On my recent trip to portland this app had let me discover so many wonderful attractions I could never have found by my own! wonder UI design makes it easy for me to find what I need. kudos to tripadvisor for creating such a marvel of an iPhone app!
Version 6.6 2013-02-01 5
Makes it easier to compare alternatives to see what you might enjoy and, often, what it will probably cost. Very helpful while planning a trip as well as once you're there.
Version 6.6 2013-03-31 5
I use TripAdvisor on my phone, iPad, and computer whenever I'm looking for a new restaurant or hotel. I trust the ratings from other reviewers, and I write many reviews myself...this app makes it easy to keep connected to this community.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
We use this app for everything when we travel. Helps us find coffee shops, restaurants and gives hotel reviews. It also gives everyday advice on things to do. You have a great variety of opinions so read through lots before you decide!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-22 2
I would never say the Old Trip Advisor app was great, it was mostly a shell that only showed content online, but this new one really s*cks! You seem to have removed location awareness, and it also doesn't seem to re-sort when you go to certain areas on the map. Why would you do this? If there is a place to set this app to be location aware, I can't find it. Why would you make an app for a mobile device that doesn't show what's around you? Bizarre.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 2
I am used to the website, and just started using the iPad app. It is so awkward to use this app to peruse restaurants and hotels for a destination. It doesn't give me the normal list - some places are missing, and when I click through to look at a restaurant I cannot navigate back to the list of rankings.  So I end up having to do the destination search over again  every time I look at a restaurant. Annoying!! I may just try using the site via safari.  Bummer
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
This app is helping me find the places off the beaten path. You don't need a huge marketing budget to get recognized by TripAdvisor and that's what I love. When I'm on the road I want to find the local spots that are unique gems. TripAdvisor is the best I've found for this.
Version 6.3 2012-08-07 5
Always have my iPhone with me, and that means I have a pocket guide to-go! Perfect for long cross country trips (encourages you to check out lodging and restaurants "outside the big city box"....as well as trying a new place close to home.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-03 5
Great app. We use it all the time to find new restaurants and hotels wherever we travel. The reviews for the most part are very accurate. I recommend you get this app and use it if you travel frequently and you just don't like surprises.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-24 5
I want information about places both near and far. With this easy to navigate app, I get answers to my questions in no time. Hotels, attractions, and restaurants (to name those I look up most) are easy to find and have reviews attached.
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 4
This app is really easy to use, and helpful for info when you have no idea about the place. It helped us book out wedding/honeymoon location and the reviews made me feel much more comfortable since it was out of the country. I would suggest this for people who travel or just finding new places
Version 5.91 2012-06-06 5
I have used tripadvisor to plan every trip for the past few years! I love the app because of its similarity to the full site's format. If you are used to the website, the app will be an easy way to plan when you can't reach your computer!
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
Nuff' said! I use TA as my travel bible! I once saw how competitors will pay people to write false reports so I was Leary at first, but quickly learned to just let it be. Everyone will have conflicting experiences...I take the good and I've never been disappointed. Thanks TA!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 3
One of the best things about Tripadvisor are the forums that enable travelers to get really specific questions answered from local experts. Sadly, the functionality of the forums on the recent version of the app lacks a back button, making navigation around the forums excruciating and tedious. Please fix this!! Otherwise this is such a useful tool on the go.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-10 3
Just to let you no you are dealing with a third party if your connection is late make sure you go to airport early if there is an earlier flight and make sure you talk to supervisor to change flight and let them call they were nice about the change after I was on hold for26 min  just make supervisor SOS and you will be takin care of faster
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
I used the TA app to help my friend and I plan a summer trip to Montreal.  All of the available reviews, info, and photos were very helpful in finding hostels to stay in, places to eat and drink, and where to go.  Will definitely be using it again to plan my trip to New Orleans!
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 4
I'll give it five stars when they add the ability to filter the user photos by category like you can on the web. Other then that the app works perfect. Like having the web site in your pocket. I can't say that for many apps out there but this one truly brings the web experience in a concise GUI on a smart phone. Great job!
Version 5.6 2011-05-25 5
So 2 of my friends decided we were going to go on a trip, so I suggested London. I went to this apps website, and it said you could download the iPhone app free, so I said why not, and got it, in a matter of 10 minutes I had a whole trip planned out, recommended hotels, places to eat and visit, 5 stars!
Version 5.6 2011-11-02 5
I have found this little app packed full of useful info.  It's even got places of interest close to us that I had no idea existed and I've lived here 54 years!  We love this app, I use it all the time. Thanks to the designer and those who created it, well done!!
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 4
Info from this app made all the difference in the world in planning my trip to Chengdu, China. The trip was a wonderful experience thanks in great part to TripAdvisor. 
I'm planning a trip to Vietnam over Tet in January 2012. This app has again provided much valid and local advice. The app is easy to navigate.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-20 5
When making your hotel, restaurant, and activity plans, always check trip advisor first.  You can't beat first hand reviews by fellow travelers!  App is an excellent complement to the full version.
Version 5.8 2011-09-10 5
When visiting DC recently I used Trip advisor to help narrow all our options of things to do down to a focused and meaningful list.  The user interface is very easy to use and works the way a traveler needs to see the information.
Version 6.3 2012-07-18 5
Website concept and subsequent app - it's a 'must have' for any trip!  Impossible to leave home without - I find myself referring to it several times per day as I make my way through my itinerary - this app rocks!
Version 5.6 2011-06-13 4
We use trip advisor all the time to plan our travel.  Having this app makes it so easy to research an area.  The ability to interact with the map while you are browsing the listings is awesome.  A few useably improvements would be nice (like don't remove pins on the map when I touch the screen to zoom in), but otherwise this app rocks!
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 4
Thank you Trip Advisor, your reviews helped in deciding where to stay and where to eat!  We had 12 wonderful nights in hotels / bed & breakfast recently in England and will use you again for our next trip.   The App was used constantly to make our vacation plans and will be used in the future!!!  :  )
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
I've been using this app in comparison to my computer and it's easy to use and the prices quoted on the app appear to be cheaper than the online prices. I'll be booking the hotel and plane shortly so I'll know for sure later. So far it's amazing and convenient!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-22 5
I use this app often. It's my go to app whenever I'm traveling. Much like the website it's very user friendly. In a nutshell if you like the website or value a regular person's opinion you'll enjoy and get use out of this app.
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 2
I notice that this App. only gives you high class restaurants and hotels. Not good if your an average person on a budget. For example I would search for restaurants near me and the results are a joke. The only one that shows up are high end restaurants that's a distant away. Don't get me wrong, these are good places to eat but I would only go there on special occasions. A lot of good local restaurants & hotels are not listed. This app. Is good if u have money to spend. I'll stick with Yelp & AroundMe.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 1
I had the free app which I loved - it saved my travel spots and so easy to use. offer pops up to "upgrade" so I do that - turns out the upgrade is a "buy" so I hit "buy" thinking it will say how much. Nope. I still don't know how much it cost. Trying to search a vacation spot and when I went to look at 2d attraction, I had to type in the town again - if this keeps up, it will get old quick. And then, and this was their big mistake , while I'm aggravated, a pop up asks me to rate - ok - right now, I preferred my old free version over this.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-12 5
When I try to save attractions it asks me to log in when I am already logged in.
UPDATE: I deleted and reinstalled the app. Now it allows me to save favorites. It's back to being my favorite travel app for ideas on what to do each city
Version 6.2 2012-06-19 5
I just did a cross-country motorcycle trip and this app was amazing.  I would ride until I got tired and then hit Tripadvisor to find a hotel.  The reviews kept me from making some bad mistakes and helped me make some cool finds.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-05 3
Need to improve functionality on this app. 
Can't vote reviews helpful.
Can't read your own contributions or see badges.
Have to scroll thru all the pictures to get to the end. Would be nice if you could skip to the oldest/ newest Pics without scrolling thru each one. 
Back button needs work as well.

Otherwise, good for the basics!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-22 2
I just ate at Mint restaurant in garden city, ny and wanted to submit a review. When I typed in the name, it auto-populates in the search field but doesn't show the restaurant in the search results. And there's no function to create a review for this restaurant. Very disappointing since I'm always getting emails from tripadvisor to rate places near me.  Additionally, it would be great if we can view all our reviews on the app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 4
Overall this is a good app, it is well laid out and easy to use. It would be nice if the hotel search via map worked more reliably, for instance if you're zoomed in on an area of the map and move it even just a tiny bit, the hotels on the list get all shuffled, which is pretty annoying.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-30 1
I don't understand all the positive reviews. The app does not present much of the information found on the Trip Advisor website. For example, restaurants. Rather than listing all of the restaurants at a destination 1-25, the app displays some  and simply leaves others out - randomly. Maybe the no-shows haven't paid their fee or something, but personally if I find it frustrating to look at a list of recommendations that starts at number three, then leaves out four, six and eleven off the list for some reason.
Version 5.8 2011-08-12 5
Very happy that I can use on my iPhone in a simpler way. I rely on Trip Advisor to get an idea of places that I'm getting ready to visit. Been using it for a VERY long time and have not been disappointed yet. And now even better I can use it on the go. Thank You!  ;)
Version 6.1 2012-06-10 5
When trying to make a decision on where to go, or where to stay, or what to eat, it's always interesting to get the TA perspective. So many different voices, always find some that resonate and help to guide our choices. Amazing resource!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
Love tripadvisor app. Use it all the time before vacation to plan, during to find great places to eat, see and after to plan for the next trip. I don't like thinking about what I missed on vacations before there was tripadvisor!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-09 5
We travel extensively, and use trip-advisor all the time. Also, our business relies heavily on trip-advisor recommendation! This is a very easy to use, and useful application to have on your iPhone and iPad - strongly recommended.
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 5
I use Trip Advisor frequently.  I travel for business constantly and rely on Trip Advisor for local restaurant recommendations. I use this more than another online service and find it is generally very accurate. Count on it!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 5
A friend used this when we were on a trip in kentucky and found it berry useful to find off the beaten path places and navigate to the place.  This has become one of my favorite apps of late.  Wouldn't go to a new place without it.
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 4
Some people know how to write a review and some don't. A quick skim through reviews yields valuable information about camp grounds and city stops. I always reference this app before a trip for good ideas. Most reviews are just "it was great" types, PLEASE start to include more details reviewers!!
Version 6.2 2012-06-17 5
Since downloading the TripAdvisor App for iPad, I have been using several times per week for business and pleasure.  I like the way I can get information on hotels, restaurants, flights, etc. in one place.  The user reviews are very helpful.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
All the reviews are helpful when we're in a new city and not sure about a restaurant or touring site. The reviews save us from wasting our time with something we wouldn't be interested in as well finding restaurants in our area and budget.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-11 5
I use this app on my iPhone several times a week to get recommendations for restaurants and lodging. I also write Trip Advisor reviews occasionally. The app is very easy to use for both purposes. Highly recommend.
Version 6.1 2012-04-30 5
We are in costa rica and pretty much planned our whole trip (at the last minute) based on tripadvisor info, from where to stay, where to eat, which your companies to use, and it has worked out great!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-17 5
I have so far enjoyed this app. I have reviewed several places around the area that I live in and I have reviewed several places that I visited while on vacation. In some ways it feels like I'm on vacation again and enjoys the sights and places. I recommend this app.
Version 6.5 2013-01-27 5
John's is a neighborhood favorite. Great food and great service all for a good price.  They usually put their own twists on traditional dishes and have come up with some neat original ideas.  It's not fancy, but it is comfortable and warm.  Try it!
Version 5.92 2012-02-11 5
My boyfriend and I were planning a trip to Parkville, MD and this app helped me to find everything I wanted and needed to know quick and easy. You don't have to go searching for information because everything you need is in front of you.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-19 5
I always reference this app for user reviews of places we're looking to travel before we book a hotel. The reviews are helpful and the pictures give you a good idea of where you'll be staying.
Version 5.8 2011-10-29 4
I have used the recs almost every time I travel. Aware that all are not authentic, I basically find the reviews useful. Traveling I-95 from NY to FL 3-4 times per year, I have had my share of horrible Motel experiences. Since using Trip Advisor I have no horrendous experiences. SC is particularly challenging; I appreciate the warnings.
Version 6.3 2012-07-19 5
Thank you for this great app! Intuitive user experience, direct links from reviews allowing immediate bookings were super helpful. Trip Advisor community in general offers balanced and reliable reviews.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 4
I used to love this app, but now I find it hard to search for specific places to see how they're rated, only cities. Also the phone numbers are no longer listed, so I have to look them up on the internet, meaning I have to leave the app. Please put it back the way it was.
Version 6.6 2013-03-10 5
I travel every week, literally, and depend on TripAdvisor for reviews of local hotels, restaurants and attractions.  I have been writing my own reviews and am 160 plus in less than a year.  It's great to hear others opinions.  Really love the app!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-23 5
I have dinned at this restaurant a few times. Love this place! Food is excellent, ambiance is great, service is very good! Live music is a wonderful touch. I am 40 years old, and I always recommend it to my friends and clients. In my opinion it has class!
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 5
User-friendly app, certainly the best free app on my iPhone in terms of functionality. Holiday / hotel reviews on-the-move have never been simpler! I cannot say enough good things about it. Go on, try it. You'll wonder why you did not get it sooner!
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
Even in my hometown of San Diego, I check TripAdvisor for restaurant recommendations, but while backpacking, I've referenced the app nearly every day, sometimes two or three times a day. Anyone traveling absolutely must have this app!
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5
So far the App has been great. I haven't actually used it on a trip, but as tool for trip preparation. I am getting a lot of great information about my upcoming trip, which is helping decide things to do. Great app  so far. Will write another review after trip.
Version 6.6 2013-03-16 5
Excellent app for planning a quick getaway, and flexing along the way as plans change. Reviews always include some grumpy people and some extra happy people, but they do help a lot.
Version 5.5 2011-04-24 4
The app has a lot of hotel specific information collected in one place, from independent reviews and un-doctored photos etc.  The map is not always accurate.  One beachfront resort showed up in the city interior and when I zoomed in on the map the pin labels vanished.  Still, very useful.
Version 6.1 2012-04-22 5
This is an excellent application as is the Trip Advisor website.

The software works very smoothly and has a lot of nice features.  I'd submitted a review before and suggested a few features that would make it even better and they've all been incorporated!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 3
The latest version of this iPad app still does not feel smooth surfing through it.  I find myself hitting links repeatedly to go where I want to.  When I am researching restaurants, there is no convenient way to return to the main list.  This app could be very useful if only the developers took the time to make it work right, and work better.
Version 6.6 2012-12-30 5

Version 6.6 2012-12-02 5
I wanted a way of keeping track of the restaurants that I have been to this ap does it just fine
I can find places to eat easily with out taking a lot of time
Fun, easy to use, I enjoy it and look forward to using it
Thanks
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 4
Great app. I use it all the time when traveling. My only complain is that the links the app. Gives to make reservations do not always work n when they work they are very slow. I kind of gave up using this app. to book anything, I just use it to read reviews.
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 5
I really like this app a lot! I wanted to go on vacation and it showed me all the cities main attractions by popularity. This real is so much better than browsing through so many websites!  It shows me hotels , places to eat, it's just great! Love this app ! So recommended to anyone.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
This app is useful to get good tips and information about wherever you may be traveling.  So far the app hasn't crashed on me and so far I've found all the sites, tours, hotels, etc. in their extensive database.   I only wish it had more search functions or search reviews by date, age range of visitors, etc.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Whether business or pleasure, I use Trip Advisor to help me determine where to stay, eat, and what to do. My colleagues have been impressed more than once when I've used the mobile app to find a good restaurant near us after a long day. This app is a must have!
Version 5.91 2012-01-16 5
I like the app; it is very useful.

However, I used to live overseas, and have returned to the U.S.  However, I have not been able to figure out how to change the default currency (and prices) for domestic flights from Euros to Dollars.

Otherwise, this is a very useful app!!
Version 8.2 2013-12-10 5
This app and site has saved me from disaster and directed me to the best places to stay the best activities to do and help when help was needed from knowledgable experts and travelers alike. It's my travel guru
Version 6.1 2012-04-05 3
Latest iteration March 2012 is pretty but inefficient and unwieldy, user navigation is less logical than before. There is no way to click on all restaurants in a list, the filters only show 18 out 39 on Catalina Island

Great layout and visually appealing and seemingly quite user friendly. I use it to monitor restaurant and hotel reviews on Catalina Island and find it a bit more comprehensive than Yelp.
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 5
I have just started using the app for the vacation we are on in South Africa. The restaurant reviews are invaluable in navigating the options available in the area. So easy to use - has become a valuable travel tool - wouldn't leave home without it.
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 3
Using the app on my iPad it is not flexible, nor friendly to change dates/month of trip to view alternative rates. Rating display of airlines is not accurate. For example, LAN has 78% satisfaction rate and better individual ratings on most criterion than Taca, but Taca appears to rank better, judging from the overall display rating. Room for improvement...
Version 5.93 2012-03-28 5
I love using Trip Advisor; whether planning a vacation out of the country or trying out a neighborhood restaurant.  It helps me to narrow down my choices and gives me a heads up in terms of expectations, etc. I would highly recommend this app!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-30 5
Trip Advisor was a life saver when planning our month-long trek trough Southeast Asia. While not all hotels are included in the app, the recommendations are spot-on, we were never disappointed when we showed up at our chosen hotel/hostel.
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 4
Would like to see the camping ground reviews that I thought I saw available through my laptop .....but apart from that it's really good and one of the worthwhile apps to download.....in fact I wld suggest everyone should have this one downloaded.  U cannot survive traveling without it
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
Use this for every trip and for most local outing, too. Love it, but wish my saves were available across the desktop, mobile, and iPad versions.  Thanks to all the folks giving advice and feedback on the site.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 3
App is helpful to TAdvisor, but needs
more helpful user features.  For example,
we need a way to be able to see and
respond to email messages from other 
users from the app instead of having to
log in to the full site... It would be great
to be able to rate a place without having
to complete a review at that moment...
things like that off the top of my head...
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Aside from the standard features of TripAdvisor, the integrated map and great user interface make it a breeze to find things to do when in a new city. As a business traveler with limited time, this app is a must have!
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 4
I like the way it picks up current and shows all things nearby.

After clicking on a point of interest, it shows the reviews and more info and pictures of it. I like that.

But what I miss is it's location on the map.
For initial result it shows them mon map, but if I go to next page, I cannt see the results on the map.
So only 4 stars
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-22 5
We planned a trip with no reservations and used this app to find hotels and attractions.  Other than one hotel, our experience has been fantastic. I would recommend that everyone download this app on their mobile device.
Version 5.8 2011-09-04 4
I travel for work and often am looking for quick information for the area around where I am staying. The "near me" and links make it useful. The only reason I didn't rate a 5 is sometimes the info is out and the user reviews are mixed with professional reviewers - usually biased.
Version 6.4 2012-08-19 5
I have been pleasantly surprised by this app.  It has been incredibly helpful for exploring countries I am less familiar with and don't have a lot of time in to waste time on tourist traps.  Thanks so much to all of the people who submit reviews!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-18 5
I travel a lot in my camper van. This ap helps me find good state parks, great meals, and fun things to do. I'm very happy with the information I get. While I have lots of travel and food aps, I never make a decision without checking Trip Advisor.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
I use their site on my computer and this is almost as good on my iPad. Easy to navigate, gives pertinent information, very useful reviews by members that do a lot of traveling and links to many other sites. It really is useful.
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5
Did someone actually complain that the website has more functionality?  SHOCKING!!!  Of course it does. This is an app on a smartphone and a darn great one. Anyone who complained about this app is ridiculous.  "that airplane can fly--my car is so limiting!!!".
Version 6.6 2012-12-09 5
Quaint  and well appointed B & B in the Traditional style. The owners Anthony & Marilyn provide a friendly and professional atmosphere that spells relaxation and rest for the weary traveler in a City that has much to offer. Two thumbs up for The Victorian House !
Version 6.6 2012-11-26 3
The only thing I don't like is the sort function, it automatically lists them by popularity which skips the sequence of numbers (3,7,15,etc).  I try to sort the results in sequence from 1 to 10, but it wont let me. The only choices are by most expensive, least expensive and popularity. As a result, you may not find the particular place that you are looking for.
Version 6.1 2012-06-24 5
Trip advisor app on iPad is really cool, it always you pin down to very specific location that you need the information for.  I am a traveller mostly on business trips I keep this handy to get exactly where I want to go. Good job trip advisor, Hi5!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 2
Reviews are great but Tilripadvisor reads them first. They review photos too. I have a negative review and they wouldn't post the photos. Something about the photos not being clear! Bullsh$t!  They were mint and I even had my BF take photos and give them to me.  Ridiculous!  Speaking the truth is a problem for them. I had undercooked chicken and they didn't want to post that I could've been sick. If they prefer to alter reviews then why bother!!
Version 8.1.1 2013-12-29 5
Trip Advisor is what I use for everything related to our holiday planning.  I check the reviews for destinations, hotels, tours and activities.  I've used it for trips to Beijing, Hong Kong, Thailand, Korea, Japan, and Australia.  So far Trip Advisor hasn't let me down!
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
We have used Trip Advisor to find hotels in Barcelona and Venice, even Arkansas, and have found it to be a great source of information. We have now added the app to our IPhones and IPad. We look forward to more info for future trips and on the go too.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Like this app it works no hangs or crashes. It could at time be easier to find your way around but it's not a big issue. It did struggle to search near a location as it kept seating near my current location not the one where I had wanted to review.
Version 6.6 2013-01-17 5
We count on this app when traveling.  It has lead us to some great hotels and restaurants and the reviews are almost always spot on!  We have submitted quite a few of our own with some helpful tips.  Recommended.
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 5
Want a local review, traveling, wondering what a restaurant is REALLY like... It doesn't get any better than trip advisor.  I can't remember a time when I used trip advisor - and my restaurant experience wasn't EXACTLY what was mentioned on trip advisor.... I swear by this app!
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 5
I love, love this app.  We travel a lot and use the on line version a lot in the past.  I just got my iPad and loaded this app right away.  It is so easy to use...even better than on line.  We can even take it with us now on the iPad.  What a wonderful travel resource!

We have used travel advisor during our trip to Mazatlan in the off season with great results. I highly recommend this app, it tales the guesswork out of dining and activities and is a great reference tool.
Version 5.7 2011-08-13 5
Tripadvisor has always been one of my favorite websites online. Thoroughly candid and amazingly accurate/honest, this application makes judging different lifestyle choices much easier.

Overall: A
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-25 5
I always used the site within the past 5 years. I only had two experiences where the hotels were BAD (Vegas Jockey and San Diego Marriott). However in there defense. The rating weren't very high. So look for hotels with four or more stars. The extra $$. Is worth it to have a GREAT TRIP.
Version 6.2 2012-07-26 5
I love Tripadvisor! I refer to it on a regular basis . I love reading the reviews and most of them are pretty accurate. It's a great travel Bible with 
very good advice. I'm a Tripadvisor  fan for sure and being a frequent traveller who appreciates the best places- I give reviews myself.
Version 5.5 2011-08-07 5
I absolutely love the whole layout.  At your fingertips approach to do your research without racking your brain.  It has reviews, suggestions and photos galore from hotels to restaurants to things to do.  Ti absolutely love it.

This is a great way to find out about places before you go there.  I've stayed at a couple places just going by the hotel's description, which is rarely like they sat.  I like to hear about it from people who have actually stayed there.  Trip Advisor is great!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 3
This app is very convenient for writing reviews when I am on the go. It is also good for checking out places when I am just roaming around and don't have a specific plan. Still, for more complete reviews I write, I would rather go to the website. Additionally, I do not like that I can't see my past review information through the app.
Version 6.3 2012-08-01 5
Love apps that are user friendly and this is one of them! Helpful info. when deciding about travel destinations.
Also fun to compare your own experience with that of others who traveled to the same area/hotel, etc.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-25 5
Tips, reservations, directions... I've been using TripAdvisor in all my trips for a long time, specially when I visit new places and need updated and reliable info. I also enjoy contributing with reviews!
Version 6.6 2013-01-11 3
As stated above. On my iPad mini the app does not rotate to portrait view, often freezes, and working with the list of sites, let's say hotels, on a map is confusing. Three stars because of the rich, useful and well researched content. Otherwise I would have given it two or two and a half. 

In summary: good content presented badly is not so good anymore.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 3
This version of the app feels less iOS-native than the last one. It doesn't "feel" good as I suspect the app is a simple wrapper around inelegant HTML. Navigation icons have been removed everywhere in favor of a hidden lefthand menu which makes basic use of the app more difficult. All in all a disappointing app execution housing excellent data.
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
On our cross country adventure we used this app frequently to find things to do and places to eat.  During the loooong drive, I was able to research and then save a list of items for each city.  Made the trip so much fun!
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 5
I got hooked on the TripAdvisor website while planning my honeymoon, and was really happy to find that the app has all the features of the site. It's amazing that you can even get hotel prices all within the app. Very useful.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-01 5
This is a great app. It is so helpful as we travel a lot and finding restaurants, hotels, etc is made enjoyable by having this. I love reading the reviews because it let's me know if the place is suited for my personality. Thank you very much, I am grateful!
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
I am a huge fan of trip advisor. I have been pleased with the advice - although you should toss out the outrageously good and bad.  I have been using the new iPad app today & have found it to be very robust. The pictures on the iPad are quite good.
Version 5.92 2012-01-26 3
The app is good, but if you originally used the tripadvisor full website you soon become frustrated by what is missing on the app. Also if you save items on the app, they are NOT saved on the full website, and any plans you saved on the site you can not retrieve on the app. You must choose one or the other or waste alot of time planning trips you can't retrieve on the other medium.
Version 6.4 2012-08-24 4
Whether hotel, restaurant or sights TA has better than average reviews and you can sift out the bad ones. I hear they charge a fortune for owners to register and can't make out their ranking system but there is usually enough info from normal honest folks to make a good decision. I use it a lot.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-22 5
I started writing review a couple of years ago and I must say this is the best app out of all my apps. I use it more than any others. Thanks TripAdvisor. Keep up the great work. Add more things to rate such as cities, bus companies etc....
Version 6.6 2012-10-21 5
I love TripAdvisor! I never book a hotel without first checking TripAdvisor. The app is especially helpful with its integrated maps functionality so I can get a sense of where hotels are relative to where I want to be.
Version 5.7 2011-07-03 5
I google everything, but my husband and i are currently on a road trip from MN through the Black Hills and down to CO and back.  This app has already led us to great places to stay, eat, and we're loving our trip because of trip advisor!
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 4
I absolutely love this app. It's easy to navigate, easy to view destinations, save destinations, look at reviews but there really needs to be an option for members to view the reviews they've posted just like on the main site. If tripadvisor app had that option I'd gladly give it a 5 star rating!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-04 5
This is wonderful app to take with you for travel ... And, to use at home. Just got back from Chicago where we used this to find attractions, restaurants .... And, more importantly, directions! Don't  leave home without it!
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 4
Using Trip Advisor is better than purchasing travel insurance.  I use it for guidance in selecting places, getting the most for my travel dollar, to help me know if the accommodation has what I want & need & to find out about great places to visit & things to do during my vacation. Thanks, Trip Advisor!
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
I'm always trying to find things to do in area close by and this allows me to learn so much about different areas! Some of the attractions I couldn't even find on the Internet when searching an area. Very very helpful!
Version 5.5 2011-04-18 5
I use trip advisor to ck reviews of pretty much anything.  My husband and I travel a lot, so since I use it so much I figured it is only fair to start writing reviews.  With this app writing and reviewing is much easier.  The best of trip advisor, but easier to access.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-17 5
I refer to this app constantly when making hotel reservations.  The "search near me" feature is great once you're checked into your hotel and looking for good restaurants nearby.
Version 6.6 2013-03-15 5
Have used in US, Ireland and Continental Europe, easy to use good information including location, numbers and web site.  Reviews are personal preference but knowing a majority opinion makes selecting places and events easy.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-10 5
Great app for travel. Obviously every place isn't going to appear, and you should know better THAN to expect everything to be included; moreover, don't expect all reviews to be completely accurate or grammatically correct...
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 5
We own a little hotel and know how important reviews can be for business. We have a great rating because we work hard at it.  Trip-advisor let's people know who's worth visiting and who is not.  Don't go anywhere without it!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-11 5
I love Trip Adviser. It takes the confusion out of planning a trip. Helps me find good rooms, things to do, and great places to eat, at the prices I want to pay.  The reviews by people, who have stayed done and eaten at the places I am considering are such a great help.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-18 5
Will never leave home without it. Location service is highly accurate and reviewers are consistent. Will always be a contributor to this site since it has provided me highly reliable info.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-18 3
App can be improved by featuring accepted credit cards at establishments, especially restaurants. This would be helpful to those of us that carry corporate American Express cards which are not widely accepted as other credit cards due to higher merchant fees charged by American Express.  Otherwise the App is a helpful tool to multiple city travelers.
Version 5.8 2011-09-29 5
Have traveled over 1,700 miles throughout Co., Az and now CA. Used this app before each stop to choose lodging & restaurants. So far, the ratings have been dead on! Will post my reviews for each selection at the end of our trip. Thanks for a great app!
Version 6.6 2012-12-05 3
I must be missing something because I find this app frustrating. One of the great things about tripadvisor is it ranks things, yet when you look for say a place to eat in the app it seemingly lists things in random order. The list might start with a restaurant that is #250. Then it does not let me add more businesses to my list, so I am stuck with all badly ranked listings.
Version 5.92 2012-02-16 5
We've researched Bermuda, Puerto Rico and Aruba.  The destination maps are so helpful in picking the right location and the customer reviews help with finalizing the decision.  The integration with the hotel websites makes it really easy to compare the properties.
Version 5.6 2011-05-21 4
Very useful for planning a trip, or making impulse decisions while on the road. The filters are useful, especially when you have specific dietary needs (such as vegetarian). But don't get too dependent on trip advisor...there are still some hidden gems that do not get reviewed...and half the fun is exploring and finding a new treasure!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-29 5
I never take the time to write reviews, but this app is so spectacular, I just had to. It helped my husband and I figure out everything we wanted to do for our little get away before we even went. It gets an A+ in our book!
Version 5.9 2011-12-26 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 5
I am a corporate pilot. I use this app when I have a day or a week somewhere new. Really helpful for setting an itinerary on the go. I would like to be able to email my wanderings though. Please add that capability to any update! Thank you!
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-16 5
Have used this app for years as our sole source of reviews of hotels, resorts, restaurants and things to do by real people, including their pictures so you get authentic information m
Version 5.92 2012-02-22 5
I have used TA for several years now, first on PC and now on iPad and iPhone. Any time I want the honest experience of a traveller rather than the sales pitch of hotel websites, I go to TA. And with all the great photos I can get a real person's view, not a staged advertisement photo.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 5
Been using this app for a mini trip and it has really helped with restaurants and attractions! Especially because most hotels now charge extra for Internet- why pay when you have an amazing app like this one!
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
Great iPad app - easy to use; map and reviews are easily accessible. App is attractive, well designed and very useful. I rely on TripAdvisor when making reservations for travel, so very glad tom have the iPad version of their app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-31 5
I have learned more in a few minutes than hours of on line searching.  I have learned about places that are close by regular stops that I would never have known about without it!!
Version 8.0 2013-10-12 3
I try to view pictures, but every time I switch over to the next photo, it takes me back to the last picture I viewed, and it does it constantly. It doesn't go from photo 10 to photo 11. It can totally bug out and go from photo 10 to photo 8 but never goes forward. Please fix this bug and I'll gladly give it a 5 star rating. I do love the app!
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
I have found this to be the most reliable, unbiased and comprehensive site for restaurant reviews. They have never failed to lead me down the right path. I travel for business quite a bit, and this is my "go to" source for great restaurants.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 5
My friend told me about hi while we were in New York. I've been using it for several months now & find it very helpful :) I love that the app helps U shop the lowest hotel rates available online!! For a frequent traveler this is a must have app!!
Version 8.3 2014-01-04 3
love the app it's very convenient in that I can find everything I need, but when I search, click on a selection (hotel, rental,ie..) and then look it over...if I decide it's not for me if hit back and it takes me all the way to the home page. I need to be able to look at what I've searched without having to refine it every time I want to look at another option. Very irritating
Version 5.91 2012-01-14 5
This is a wonderful app. Real information from fellow travelers. The hotel sites can show you magnificent views but the don't tell you about the noisy rooms, bad staff, or bad food. This site has both helped me to decide yes and no on various hotels.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-10 5
I found this to be an asset when planning our recent vacation. We drove in places I had not been before and it helped me to make great choices. I wished I would have had it the one night we chanced it. Learned my lesson!
Version 6.6 2013-03-11 5
Great app (& website). Extremely useful. Real life reviews are always better than sales pitch brochures and recommendations. I use this a lot, even if I'm not traveling. The fun of exploring thru this app creates travel dreams and a great education.
Version 8.3 2013-12-27 5
I check Trip Advisor before booking any hotel or trip or for advice on where to eat while we're away, and what to expect.
I've had many successful, adventerous trips thanks to Trip Advisor!
Version 8.4 2014-02-02 5
We have learned not to travel anywhere without going through Trip Advisor!!! They have saved our sanity more than one time!!!! They do ALL the leg work and we get to enjoy their hard work!!! Im very faithful to Trip Advisor!!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-16 5
We use all the features on this site....hotels, restaurants and attractions and have never been disappointed.  I recommend restaurants that are not chains.  Local restaurants = Local flavor = Local small businesses.  Support the backbone of our economy!
Version 5.9 2011-11-04 5
We use Trip Advisor for every adventure we plan. Great being able to compare rates on lodging and flights. They don't have all the options, but are always helpful with photos, attractions and ratings submitted by their users.
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 5
I use this app every time I go anywhere. My most used app by far. Gives you insider opinions on just about anything you might want to do, stuff that the hotels/companies/businesses don't tell you in their promotional literature. Thank you TripAdvisor!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-23 4
We like to see what people say before trying a new place and this helps greatly. You can sort from the good and bad reviews and then decide.  The app gives a blank green screen sometimes when posting a review and some other glitches but don't let that stop you.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
Very helpful app especially when going into something nearly blind. One improved feature would be maps in local languages. I tried to tell people the street names of the hotel I found and nearby landmarks, but to no avail because they had no idea what I was saying. Other than that it seems like a great app!
Version 6.1 2012-05-04 5
Works well from my iPad! I made all necessary reviews while on travel in Buenos Aires, and Outer Banks of North Carolina. It's been extremely useful in finding restaurants and local attractions in France and Italy. Next we'll try attractions while in Tibet?!
Version 5.9 2011-11-07 5
I agree with everyone that loves this app!  In traveling across America this Nov 2011 it helped soooo much in where to stay and more importantly where not to.  I do wish it could store a record of previous info but other than that I highly recommend it.
Version 5.7 2011-06-26 5
Hands down, the best app for restaurant and hotel reviews. This is real-world insight from my peeps. I travel the southeast regularly, in Charleston, SC last week and enjoyed seafood at Hank's, a top TA eatery.  They had possibly the best salmon this old boy has ever put between my lips. Thanks TA!
Version 6.6 2013-02-26 5
The title says it all.  I used it as guide for the last trip we took and it was right on time.   Very reliable and provided us with much needed information.  Need more information on golf courses....will use it on every trip we take
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-19 2

Version 8.5 2014-03-04 5
Indispensable tool for trip planning, flight booking and reviewing your favorite points of interest. A solid and very necessary tool for travel photographers and journalist!
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
I always check with Trip Adviser before I go some where.  Not only does it tell me how people liked various hotels and restaurants, but it often gives me ideas about things to do as well.
Version 5.8 2011-09-04 5
I just recently downloaded the app and have had great fun exploring the world of travel and getting ideas.  So far I haven't made any reservations oe followed through on any recommendations, but will do so in the next week or two.
Version 6.2 2012-07-15 5
I've been going to Trip Advisor for years for my travel planning and always loved the site.  I recently bought an iPad and installed the Trip Advisor app. I love it! It is so easy to get around and quickly find what I'm looking for.  Thank You!
Version 8.5 2014-02-24 5
I've used the TripAdvisor website for years to help me plan vacations. The app makes it convenient to find restaurants & attractions when I find myself someplace I didn't have time to plan for in advance.
Version 5.6 2011-05-20 5
By reading so many user reviews instead of just the company reviews, I can make better trip choices, currently enjoying a great stay in San Francisco, at a moderately priced hotel, in a family friendly neighborhood bc of trip advisor!
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 4
Great app. Gave 4/5 because I'm not sure it lists any of the obscure places on top of the typical tourist spots. For example on Billy Connolly's trip across Northern America and Canada he stopped at a place where a guy made celebrity scare crows! It was really creepy, but something different and fun!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 4
I actually enjoy using the app to get reviews on properties I plan to visit and make reservations. I would like for the calendar/my dates are flexible feature made available to scan the prices by the month like they have on the main site. Other than that, it really meets my needs.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 3
Different views show different information which often requires digging in different places to put together a complete picture of ratings, price, menu, etc.  Tripadvisor is great but the app has a ways to go to catch up with the website.  It feels like sections of the app were written by different people and then kludged together.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-26 2
I always use TripAdvisor before planning ANY trips! The wealth of info on the website has saved me from many hotel nightmares! So, I was excited to see a TripAdvisor app. But *this* app has very outdated restaurant info! It has a listing for a restaurant that closed down over 15 years ago, as well as listing the restaurants that opened and closed down in this same restaurant's space! How helpful is that?I say stick with the website until this app is updated!
Version 6.6 2012-10-19 5
I enjoy going to places as I travel the USA for my job.  I will warn readers to stay away, watch what goes on, or Relax and Enjoy!!!  The best part is...  The merchant has no idea I am there... Thus nothing special is done and I get to review fairly!!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-12 5
I can't leave home without it. I finally downloaded the app to my phone. I had been using just the computer before now. I am planning my entire vacation to Key West using trip advisor. Thank you.
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 5
Went to Cardiff over the weekend, and two restaurants and one bike hire place recommended by TripAdvisor were now gone.  We still use the app regularly and love it 90% of the time.
Version 6.4 2012-09-15 5
One of the best apps for when you are stuck on business travel and away from home on the weekend and you want to find something to do.  Easy filter system to limit searches to museums or parks, etc.
Version 6.6 2013-02-26 4
I found this app pretty helpful overall for finding hotels and reading reviews, however the search feature was a bit limited and didn't allow me to filter by brand name easily. This would be a nice feature to add.
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
I am currently in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on holiday. I checked on Yelp and the app did not have any information about restaurants in this wonderful city. Tripadvisor, on the contrary, was full of restaurants with review, information, etc. Way to go!
Version 7.1 2013-07-17 5
I am on the road 5 days out of the week and I needed a dependable application for locating hotels, restaurants, Starbucks, etc. Trip Advisor filled the bill 100%. Trip Advisor is the bible for the business person who lives on the road.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 4
Hugely helpful for both planning a trip and on the fly.  I really like the iPad version. Lots of filters and ability to see map or list view.  It's important to me to be able to read the reviews of other customers vice just the hotels' propaganda, and tripadvisor let's me do just that.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-23 5
This app is very convenient not just when traveling but also finding out cool stuff in your home town.  A must have for any one who loves planning trips. You won't be disappointed
Version 5.9 2011-11-01 5
I have this app on my iPhone and it saved our trip to Mexico last week when Hurricane Irina threatened the Mayan Riviera. We were able to find a great B & B in the interior of the Yucatan peninsula and managed to save our vacation. Will never travel without it!!
Version 3.0 2009-07-27 5
I used it all last week while I was gone on vacation! In Cody, Wy we ate at the #1 and it didn't let us down! Then off to Jackson Hole, Wy we ate at another top rate place, it was the best steak we have ever eaten! I have always used tripadvisor and it has yet to let me down!
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
Trip Advisor is always helpful when doing research for hotels, cities, resorts and other attractions. We have used it to travel throughout New England, New Zealand, DC, Philly, and California. We also use it to find day/weekend activities for our toddlers.
Version 8.4 2014-02-03 5
I use this app all the time! When I travel it guides my choices of places to eat, what hotel I stay in and any activities we do. I post frequently because I want others to share in my experience by finding this app useful.
Version 5.92 2012-02-02 5
I'm a huge fan of Trip Advisor on the Internet. This app is very similar. 
What I like most is that the reviews and photos are by real travelers, like you and me. 
I use  T. A. Often, even for local hotels and restaurants. 
Get this APP. 

PS
Don't just read reviews... Give them !
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 4
This app is great. I used it quite a bit to find info on everything during a roadtrip. I love the save feature. However, if you are a play it by ear person, this app is useless without 3G or wifi which is much of the country when driving. It's not perfect, but quite useful. A keeper!!
Version 6.6 2012-11-13 5
I travel for work almost every week & TripAdvisor never disappoints. Whether you are traveling to major cities or Dodge City, KS, you can find valuable info for hotels & restaurants. An absolute must for travel!
Version 7.1.1 2013-10-21 5
When we're  the road this app comes in very handy.  We can instantly find out where to go, what to see and where to eat. We usually do our homework before we arrive but now Tripadvisor is with us wherever we go. How convenient!
Version 6.4 2012-08-24 2
I am very frustrated by the fact that many of the restaurants and or hotels and adventures I write about are not on your list and so you won't accept a critique... How does a person get a restaurant on your list? I was just at a great little restaurant called Baya Bistro and I would like to recommend it, but because you don't know it exists, I can't do so. And please, don't assume, as you did about a horse back riding adventure I wrote about, that it is my venture. I'm retired.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-16 2
First things first: search for nearby restaurants, select one, view it on the map, go back, and back again: now the restaurants are sorted by rating and not distance.

Secondly it's got pretty bad data on nearby restaurants in the Metaxourgous area in Athens.

Generally speaking it's laggy.

Doesn't work offline which would be awfully handy for a travel app. At least remembering my starred choices would be great.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 5
Most travel apps are USA-Centric but this one works well in Europe too! We are stationed here with the US Army and used it recently to help find attractions and restaurants on a trip to Saarland and Rheinland Pfaltz. It worked well and hell the price is absolutely spot on :-D
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 5
Have been using my Trip Advisor app for the past three months while traveling to unfamiliar destinations. It has been invaluable in selecting the right accommodations and restaurants. So far...this is a "five star" app in my opinion!!! Check it out!!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5
This app is great! It does all of the research for you! We always use it and have been using TA for many years. It hasn't failed us once! I would love a Spa Review place as well it is so hard to find amazing spas.
Version 5.92 2012-02-10 5
This sure as hell is a great app and website all around!
I used it this for a project about traveling Europe and found everything so simple to find and convenient. I am definitely using it for my  future trips!
Well done. 5* all the way!
Version 6.1 2012-06-04 5
If you're planning a trip, trip advisor is the way to go! You can view photos uploaded by real people, not just the pretty ones from the company. it's streamlined and very user friendly. So happy I found this app!
Version 6.6 2013-01-02 3
In general, this is helpful on the road  BUT.  Just spent 10 minutes reading about a hotel and searching for contact info, which wasn't listed in the app. Nor was there a link to the hotel's website. Finally just found the hotel's website via internet, only to discover I had wasted my time, since the hotel does not allow pets. Why no pet filter?
Version 8.3 2013-12-28 5
The subject of this review will tell you everything that i need to say plus a lot more. I recommend you download the app, use it, register and start you own reviews. :)
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-06 5
As a frequent traveler to some remote/unusual places, I use this app all the time. It has saved me from some horrible hotel experiences. Truthfully, I use this more than almost any app on my phone. Wouldn't want to travel without it!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-24 5
Whether vacation planning, or business travel, this is the app you need to make sure you feel safe, feel comfortable, are satisfied with the service, food, etc... Etc....
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 3
This app is seemingly become 'more basic' as time has passed. You used to be able to look at "traveler tips" from the reviews and choose whether you wanted to view photos submitted by travelers OR hotel management. No longer...unless I'm severely missing something. It still gets the job down though, but gets downgraded from a 5 star to a 3 star for me.
Version 5.9 2012-01-10 5
Loving it. I've wandered about in BA now for a couple days, this app makes it easier to find more info quickly. I don't have to guess about a restaurant, or something fun to do. Also very helpful that BA is wifi friendly everywhere
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
Can't say how much of a help this app has been,booking over seas trip & tripadvisor really takes the guess work out of the uncertainty. I won't check in unless if checked it out on tripadvisor. Very nice
Version 5.7 2011-07-22 5
This app is a very simple way to access the myriad reviews when traveling. I use it all the time and thank all of those reviewers for their thoughtful insights and sharing their experiences.
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 5
This app is incredible it depends on reviews from each one of us out here. Honest reviews from the every day traveler and the local explorer makes this app what it is!
Version 6.0 2012-06-27 5
I came up with my husband on a business trip, and trip advisor helped me find lots of things to do. The restaurant guide was right on, and I loved the antique car museum. It poured during the visit, and the museum was a great surprise.
Version 6.4 2012-09-01 4
This app is a must have when traveling. Tripadvisor can suggest things near by your current location and gives you their ranking. I have found the ratings to be very helpful when making decisions on what to do. Great how it gives you motels, restaurants, and things to do.
Version 6.0 2012-03-29 5
Love this app.  I look to it first when I want any kind of info on an area.  The reviews are so helpful.  It is also fun to do your own review.  You either share your enjoyment or know you are helping to save others from a poor experience.  Nice.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-12 5
This is a quick and easy app to use for travel help. I've used it frequently to find restaurants and things to do.  Reviews from other travelers generally give a rounded view of what's available.
Version 7.1.1 2014-01-04 5
So grateful to have customer reviews based on personal experience rather than hotel sales & marketing info that can be misleading. We ALWAYS check trip advisor before checking in :-)
Version 5.92 2012-01-29 5
I love this App and use it all the time for anything travel/destination related needs. It's reliable, comprehensive and all reviews are done by people who have experience first hand. It gives a true review and not "paid" type fake reviews.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
Trip Advisor is my tool if choice when planning a vacation. The mobile version is a user friendly option for anyone on a smartphone or tablet. The other Trip
advisor users are what makes Trip Advisor work.
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 5
This is a must-have app.  With my new iPad it's incredibly fast and extremely user-friendly.  No complaints.  Also use it with my iPhone.  It's outstanding. And now being able to save places makes it even more useful for planning.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
My "Go-To" app for restaurant reviews. For a serious foodie this app will help you to avoid the dogs in town and discover the real gems. You can vote with your dollars and this app. Gotta love the power of social media to reward the best and ignore the rest.
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
This app is awesome.   It is easy to use, well laid out, intuitive and always very informative.  I use it for major trips and am never let down.  Love the fact you can make dinner reservations too!   Great tool for travelers.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-19 5
Always dependable, reliable reviews.  Great way to find things to do when you're out of town, or anywhere for that matter.  I've had so many wonderful vacation experiences thanks to this app.  Fantastic!
Version 8.5 2014-03-14 5
Trip Advisor has become our primary trusted source for restaurant guidance wherever we travel. We don't always agree with a rating, but we haven't found any other resource that approaches its universality and accuracy.
Version 6.6 2013-03-12 5
I love that tripadvisor can guide you no matter where you are. We had about an hour to kill for lunch in Fresno, CA, before a return flight home to Texas. We found the best Mediterranean restaurant through tripadvisor. Thank you, Trip Advisor!
Version 5.8 2012-01-02 1
I have trusted trip advisor for everything. However to see The Hop and French Broad Chocolate Lounge rated as best restaurants really makes me question other ratings. Neither are really restaurants.... One an ice cream shop( good for ice cream). But not a restaurant and the French Broad is a dessert place and late night hang out, not a restaurant. I live in Asheville, have been to both but will never trust trip Advisor for other towns again. Now I have another gripe.... I have tried  lots of nicknames and all are taken, I don't have time to try forever!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 4
Find this site very helpful in looking up information !! Today was the 1st day in couple mts I have been able to rate in on my mobile yeah!!! Glad it has been fixed on the upgrade was always getting a submit sign in symbol error.   Its a great app.  Get it you will love it :)
Version 5.1 2011-08-08 5
I am very happy fro this site and information provided on this site. This site is supported by very responsive team. They respond back to your email in timely manner. Their iPhone app is also excellent!
Version 6.4 2012-08-21 5
Love the reviews and the pics!! Really helped in planning my last and next trips. Makes planning so much easier and you feel more confident about your choices when you've read the reviews.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
I have never been steered wrong by Trip Advisor. We used it for a quick weekend to L.A. and Temecula, and used it the whole trip.   Just read the reviews, take all the info into consideration, and make a good choice with Trip Advisor.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-10 5
I'm new to Trip Advisor and have only done a few reviews. I was so surprised my review on Harold Seltzer's, Port Richey, FL in their add today in the Sun Coast News. 
Using Trip Advisor has been very strait forward and easy for me to figure out. I think it's great!
Version 8.5 2014-03-03 5
This app has everything I could hope for.

It's very easy on the fly to both check and post reviews. I find it so useful when searching for a
Good place nearby to eat.

This app is a must have for every iPhone
Version 8.2 2013-11-30 4
Great information is available.  Wish maps (locations of newer hotels were updated more).  Also would love to have an individual resort map of all the resorts available to view.  Would be great if age of property and renovation dates were included for hotels, too.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-21 4
If you have used TA's app for sometime you know this latest version is finally a great experience. You can now access the entire site and its content on your mobile device. It's groovy for all your travel needs!
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
I use this app all the time, especially when  unfamiliar with a destination I have never been to. Saves a lot of time and energy in doing research. Mainly, you should use this to avoid the misery of staying in bad lodging!
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 5
I LOVE Trip Advisor and the honest reviews and photos from travelers like myself! It's great now that I can search hotels, restaurants and attractions from my phone and also place reviews from my phone too!
Version 6.6 2012-12-12 4
I have some problems getting it to show me all of the restaurants in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. It seems like it was working better when I was there but today finding restraints there seems to work better in the web browser, than in the app. It keeps jumping from Mexico to Spain.
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 4
We use Trip Advisor almost exclusively when we are planning a trip.  We spent two weeks in Canada last summer and planned the entire trip thru Trip Advisor.  While planning the Canada trip thru Trip Advisor we found the Gypsy Guide which enhanced our trip and made it much more informational.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
I really like being able to check reviews on restaurants and hotels when we are traveling.  I also enjoy doing reviews when we eat out of stay somewhere.  Definitely a great resource and I recommend it for everyone.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-28 1
We went for dinner expecting a wonderful dinner in a charming historical spot. Instead we had slow service ,short drinks, small wilted salads, oversakted main course a captain with an attitude and truly tacky guests dressed in sneakers and baseball caps or busy taking pictures of their food like they had never been out to dinner before. Plus the added attraction of someone who came from nowhere we could tell
And started singing. 
All in all a truly negative experience
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 3
Not a bad app. 
However, unless I can't find it, there's no way to email anyone from ones own contact list. Many times I'm just browsing and I want to shoot off an email as a suggestion of a place to stay, but there's no dedicated way to do that. 
Also, landscape orientation only. :-/
But on the plus side, like the simple minimalist design.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
I've used Trip Advisor for years and it has made our vacations so much better.  The hotel ratings are awesome, but my favorite feature is "attractions" - it helps to find out which attractions are best and worth the money!  Thanks Trip Advisor!
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-06 4
Whenever I travel I use tripadvisor.  However I like the website better than the app.  If I visit a restaurant or hotel that's not already on tripadvisor I cannot add it from the app.  I have to send the request on the website. By the time I have access to a computer I've already forgotten.
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 4
I love that I can check for reports of bed bugs on this app. When traveling with small children it is important to me that I reduce the possibility of the inconvenience of having to change rooms or hotels if a room doesn't pass my bug inspection. I will not stay at a hotel if it has had reported cases.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
Very helpful app for finding local attractions, restaurants, hotels & other when out of town or on vacation. I like that I can save my favorites and sometimes enjoy giving reviews too
Version 5.9 2011-11-10 5
Been traveling quite a bit lately and one of my first stops when I get to a new town / city is trip-advisor for places to see and stay.. Almost like having a local in your pocket
Thanks!
Version 6.6 2012-11-04 5
Wonderful app that gives more information than any other site I've found. The hotel ratings are much more accurate than anywhere else and the forums are full if information!
Version 8.1 2013-11-10 5
I travel a lot in Japan and Taiwan as well as the east and west coasts of the US and I have TripAdvisor by my side on every trip. It's fast easy to use, full of info with a variety of options for searching and finding your way around.
Version 8.5 2014-03-25 5
TripAdvisor is the best app for finding reviews of hotels, restaurants, and attractions in the U.S. and Europe. Unbiased user reviews give lots of useful info. Rarely have I been steered wrong following their recommendations.
Version 6.2 2012-07-04 5
My husband leans heavily on TripAdvisor in choosing lodging all over the world. We are grateful for this resource and all the contributors  He reads the many reviews all the way through for insights. We are rarely disappointed.
Version 5.8 2011-09-11 4
Love this app! Saved a lot of time looking for things to do and places to go nearby us on our vacation. Satellite views helped us with a general "lay of the land" so we could decide if breakfast would be a short walk or a cab ride. You will not be disappointed with this app!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-22 5
Have yet to be steered in the wrong direction for food or hotel recommendations.  Awesome memories thanks to folks who take the time to share their experiences, good and bad.  We don't travel without using Trip Advisor.
Version 8.3 2013-12-23 5
Loving this app! Easy and convenient. A real gem if you are a TripAdvisor contributor. The best way to let others know about your experiences at hotels, restaurants, attractions, etc. Just sign in a start reviewing, what could be easier.
Version 5.92 2012-02-16 5
I travel for living and I will be lost without Tripadvisor. I can see where everything is: concentration of hotels and restaurants is a great indicator to know where to stay and where to o in any city. This app is perfect for it. Very user friendly. Top marks.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
We were traveling 1000 miles from home to somewhere we had never been and was unfamiliar with the entire route. This app was very handy finding restaurants. Just wish it would have been able to find gas.
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 5
This is great!  We have found good hotels and restaurants using this. One nite we went to a restaurant that had a good Zagats rating. We didn't check trip advisor. Had a terrible meal. I checked TA later and saw a one star rating.  I'll always use this in the future.
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5

Version 6.1 2012-06-10 5
I used the website before getting an iPad. The site has great customer reviews and not those inspired by marketing. I can review personal experiences and judge for myself if good to do or not.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
Very helpful. Up to date in most of the reviews. Finally an app where common people can share their experience about a certain place without to put up with the "professional critics" high demand.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
This is a great app! I've paid for more expensive hotels at times assuming they would be nicer - cleaner, better amenities- only to be disappointed. Now with other travellers' reviews at my fingertips, I can get the best price on the best hotels!
Version 6.6 2013-04-12 5
This has been the best app that I have found so far to help me plan my upcoming vacation. It is easy to use and has a lot of helpful information! I love that you can search for top rated activities and restaurants near hotels or guesthouses.
Version 6.2 2012-06-21 4
I use TA frequently and enjoy the reviews and pictures. I would like to suggest restaurants and lodging that aren't listed, but haven't figured it out yet. Or perhaps there isn't a way. I don't use the web version too much and am glad to have the mobile ap especially when I travel.
Version 6.0 2012-04-05 5
We were in town for the women's Final Four basketball championship and loaded the bar at all different hours of the day and night. Jennifer was incredibly accommodating and helped to facilitate an amazing experience  thanks, Jennifer!
Version 5.93 2012-03-12 5
This is a great travel tool to have. It can help with almost everything when your traveling. Knowledge is power and sure can save you a lot of wasted time and money. I use it all the time when I'm away from home and I love it!  Get it today!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 3
I like and use the app a lot.  But every time I try something new on it, it doesn't work. I opened the app and input a restaurant review. When submitted, it says that I'm not logged in. I hit the Login button and nothing happens. My app settings show that I'm logged in. I had to submit the review on Safari. I have iPhone 5 with latest iOS and trip advisor app v831.
Version 5.8 2011-08-20 5
Researching using this app is so easy, writing a reviewing and sharing photos of my horrible experience is even easier to do my ipad. 

This is the best app to use for any travel experience you want to read about or share!
Version 6.1 2013-08-30 5
Trip Advisor is consistently accurate.  Aside from the "stars" we find that reading a half a dozen or reviews from other travelers for each of out inquires provides the opinions, advice, hints and nuances we rely on.
Version 5.8 2011-08-14 5
While I've only had the app for a short while, I can already tell it will be very useful when planning a trip. It makes comparing hotels a snap, and I look forward to using it for vacations in the future!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
We use this app so much when we're traveling.  We find good places to stay, to eat, and things to do.  I always appreciate some little detail thrown in by the reviewers that gives me an idea of what to expect.
Version 3.0 2009-04-11 1
Worthless for my iPod Touch. You MUST have location services turned on to use. I don't live in a large area, and location based service through WiFi is non-existant here. Without the abilitiy for the software to determine my location, it can't be used. Should have the ability to key-in location without having the software find it for me... It sits at the opening screen stating, "Unable to determine your location." and "Please try again later" How much later? When they update the software to let me key-in my location???
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-20 5
This app give you all the benefits of trip advisor from your smartphone. Aside from the occasional extreme review, you can always find great information on a place.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
I love using the TA App whenever we travel.  The information on dining and lodging us a great help and the unbiased reviews are welcomed.  I find that I rely on TA quite often.  The info provided is usually right on.
Version 5.7 2011-08-30 5
This new boutique hotel in Albuquerque is a treasure!  It's history is fascinating as the former Santa Fe Hospital. Although there is no on site restaurant...there's plenty of places within a short walk or drive.  Super comfortable and clean!  A new fav!
Version 6.6 2013-03-30 5
My husband and I love Trip Advisor! We use it on a regular basis any time we go anywhere. The app is almost as good as the website and easy to use, especially if you are on your travels. I highly recommend this app to anyone!
Version 5.9 2012-01-03 5
A must have website to reference for all travelers.  This is just an app version and thus a short cut to the site.  Works great!  Highly recommended to anyone who wants to know what people like you think of places you are going to go.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-22 5

Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5
I am very visually oriented and have been burned by many sales pitches for the best hotel ever! To be able to see how other patrons view the accommodations and the various pictures is valuable to our decision making. Love Trip Advisor!
Version 6.6 2013-01-01 5
App is easy to use both for writing reviews and reading them.  We used recently for a very impromptu trip to Florida and was extremely pleased with the ease of use and the quality of reviews.
Version 8.2 2013-12-01 5
I used trip advisor on a recent vacation. We tried several restaurants based on the user reviews. We didn't have a single bad meal!  This app is easy to use. It made my vacation a wonderful experience. I will use it on every future trip.
Version 5.9 2011-11-16 5
If you need to know where to or stay or eat. Trust trip advisor. Ratings by people who have been there. Always right on. Easy to use and works perfectly. Use it before you go and save the anguish of a bad trip or dining experience. *****
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 5
With all the wealth of information of the full site this app brings you everything you love about trip advisor to an intuitive iPad interface. The solid map integration makes this a great tool for overall trip planning.
Version 5.7 2011-06-25 4
I only recently started using trip advisor and I've already booked two vacations and tried out two restaurants. The suggestions and reviews were right on! In fact I'm at one of the condos we rented for the weekend right now-found it on trip advisor. Tip: only go with accommodations that have plenty of reviews!!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 5
I absolutely love Trip Advisor. The app is great, easy to use, and very convenient on the iPad.  Site always gives me the information I need and never stay anywhere or visit unless I have checked it out oh TA first.  Download!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-12 5
So far I really like this app. I still prefer trip advisor on a computer, but that's simply due to screen size; this is no fault to the app. The app is convenient and offers most of the quirks of the regular website. I like it!
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5
Ever wish you had someone on the inside? You know, a local with all the local scoops on the REAL great places to go? Well, now you do! Great app! I just got it today and I'm planning so much fun stuff for my family on our beach vacation!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
Love this app,  great feedback from travelers...it's nice to be able to get tips before going from people that were just there....also nice to see actual pics since most of the time you get to a hotel and it doesn't look anything like the pics!
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 5
Not much to say beyond great.  TripAdvisor is the gold standard for review sites, and their app is even easier to use!  Intuitive navigation, favorites for easy access to information.  All apps should work this well.
Version 6.1 2012-05-02 5
Tripadvisor has saved me from some bad experiences based on people's reviews. This app is easy to access and I can find pretty much any business nd review it real quick before taking my business there. I like the app.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-23 5
This app is the best available for anyone wishing to find out other's opinions on restaurants, hotels, etc. 

You can search by name, city, or venue. You can also add your own expertise to the places you visit.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
You have to have this on any travel adventure!  Like asking the locals what is worthwhile, but even better because you get a summary, rating and more.  Love the map feature too.  Pack your suitcase and this app before a trip!
Version 6.1 2012-05-10 5
I live on the road. I always, always check restaurants out on the trip advisor ap. Also like the ability to read about points of interest and attractions. Don't use it for hotels unless Marriotts aren't close by.
Version 6.2 2012-07-13 5
Valuable information from the people who know best: the travelers. I love my app - especially the ability to see real pics by hotel guests. Very helpful when trying to make a selection!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 5
I make all our family travel plans, US and overseas.  Trip advisor is my primary research tool.  I normally have trip advisor open on one devise while working with my reservations on another.  Trip Advisor has NEVER led us wrong!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
This app helped my family immensely when trying to find a hotel to stay in while in an unfamiliar area. The map features are great. I especially appreciate the high quality of the traveler reviews.
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
We just planned a trip to Washington DC and this app was indispensable in finding our way around, attractions, & restaurants. You can even make reservations from here. It was extremely helpful and easy to use.
Version 5.7 2011-08-05 5
There is more to this than yelp. There seems to be more reviews and I like the percentage number scoring.  Sometimes the app seems a little slow and fails were Yelp works. Maybe another update will improve speed.
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 4
The latest update is smoother and better looking.  But for me, the heart of the app is the near me now section.  It is harder to find, in this version.  But, overall an excellent app still.  I have never gone to a highly rated restaurant, and been disappointed.  Still best in its class...
Version 4.1 2011-08-06 5
If I were forced to choose 1 or 2 apps for my iPhone TA would be one of my choices.  As I write I am looking for a place to eat in Baltimore and I get all the info I need in one place.  I've been a TA fan for many years and have never been steered wrong.
Version 5.9 2011-12-06 5
I use this app when I want to get real reviews from real people. Even if it's a local place, I like to see what everyone is saying about a place and than decide if it's worth my time. This app is so continent and fast!
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 5
Anytime I am looking for a hotel or a place to eat I always check to see what tripadvisor says...the only thing I would change on the app is a place to add a hotel or restaurant so while on the road you can rate places that aren't on there
Version 6.6 2013-01-04 5
It is a great application that really helps to find pretty much everything based on the real experience. You can find amazing places , you don't need anything while you are going on vacation but trip-advisor.
Version 6.2 2012-06-12 4
TripAdvisor is (of course) an invaluable resource. The omission of driving directions remains a glaring flaw with the app. Since the 6.2 update promised "an improved map experience," I had hoped the developers finally got this sorted, but no. Why not simply launch the iPhone's map app?
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
Probably the best app to turn to when you're traveling in "uncharted territories". Always have this app with me one way or the other when I travel; have always found the information to be accurate.
Version 5.91 2012-01-24 4
Great app for this great site. Quick interface and seamless integration to web access to hotel websites. Map display could be better though, as tapping on 'see on map' moves out to too large a zoom level. Wish the My Saves feature could be tied to your account and so be accessed across platforms.
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 5
I love being able to look up restaurants, hotels and activities when we are local or traveling and knowing what other people thought about it. I also enjoy being able to rate the places I visit while I'm there.
Version 6.6 2012-09-29 4
Looking up hotel ratings helped us to decide which B&B to stay in on our recent trip to the UK. After we found that we had made a good choice, we began using the app to quickly look up restaurant and attraction ideas. Looking forward to more positive experiences.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-04 5
I really enjoy having Trip Advisor in the palm of my hand. I live the ease of reading others opinion at the locations I patronize and I really love the convenience of posting a review immediately upon being serviced.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-30 4
Had this app for only a few days, but so far so good.  It gives you a considerable amount of good information.  Still have to use it but expecting to soon for a short trip.  If this works out will consider a longer one.  Expecting a lot form this app, hope it produces.
Version 5.92 2012-02-23 5
I use this app all the time to find new restaurants, things to do, and places to stay. It works flawlessly and has never served me wrong. Find hidden gems in your area with this app. Opinions are normally inline with my own.
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 1
Wow, you ruined a great app.  The new functionality is awful and has made it much harder to navigate.  More importantly, a lot of information is actually inaccessible!  For example, on the TA website a town might have 12 hotels listed, but this App lists only 6 of them!  Also, you can no longer navigate to a place on a map, hit the "search here" button, and get all the nearby listings (this was a fantastic option). 

I can't say this strongly enough - scrap the changes and go back to the prior version. This is awful.
Version 5.7 2011-08-03 5
Downloaded the app half way through our I10 road trip. Wish I had done it from the beginning!  Found some great places to eat and it helped with the " where to stay" question each night. Thank you SO much!
Version 6.0 2012-03-23 2
How does an average restaurant or hotel with 3.5 or 4 stars and a couple dozen ratings get a higher ranking than a place that consistently ranks 4.5 stars with more ratings get a lower rating? There's something dubious about TA's ranking system. It seems especially egregious in places that I know well. Like Sedona, Az; Williams, Az; and, Flagstaff, Az.

Also, there are too many defunct restaurants listed. TA needs a better way to clean-up their venues that are history.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 2
I love trip advisor. However, the app is nowhere near as good as when I use the site through Safari on any of my mobile devices. I hate using the app.  It just isn't that good (no offense).  I just don't see the benefit of using the app over going to the site.  I wish the app was better. With that said, it will do the basic stuff you may need. So to summarize, I give trip advisor, the site, 5+ stars, but the app only 2 (and I'm being generous).
Version 5.92 2012-02-04 5
I was using AroundMe. I tried this at the suggestion of a friend. Darted out by looking around me neighborhood to met a feel for it. Im hooked on this app now. Easy to use, intuitive, complete. Great app to go when you don't know where to go or just need ideas.
Version 6.2 2013-04-13 5
Ive used the app at home and on every trip ive taken. It was very usefull on our honeymoon in New Zealand.  The reviews were accurate, the telephone numbers where correct. Overall its a ver usefull app and very userfriendly.
Version 6.1 2012-06-17 4
I loved this app. I downloaded the Boston city guide, and it was really handy for finding restaurants and attractions. I love how you can search "find best nearby" to locate good places in your immediate area. I'm going to London later this year and I'm so glad I have this app; I think it'll come in handy again.
Version 6.2 2012-06-20 5
Works just like web app with addition of knowing your location. Very helpful and easy to use. Easy to plan trips at home and reference saved items with tablet or phone.
Version 5.5 2011-05-08 5
I love trip advisor.  It makes finding a decent room, while on the go, a snap.  The additional option of being able to book on the move, and reviews from "real" people, makes this an app that the traveller in all of us needs to have on their iPad !
Version 5.6 2011-06-13 5
I have always used the website to help plan my vacations and the app is great. It's really nice to go to restaurants and there's a 'near you' feature so you can find good places to eat right where you are. Definitely recommend.
Version 5.6 2011-05-21 5
At times, it seems like it is hard to get all info when you are planning a trip to an international location. Trip Advisor allows you to search and gather disparate detail on one site. One of the best out there!
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
Simply, it's on of the best application that I have. It's free, so you can have to compare it with other prices and you may surprise by the result. It's the cheapest one actually and so far I bought 6 flight tickets from it.
Version 6.1 2012-04-10 3
Graphically this is a much nicer presentation than looking at TripAdvisor online on my iPad. That said, it seems to have lost some of my saved hotels and has a somewhat confusing interface. It's really hard to figure out how to get to the "other" category of hotels for example. Though I love the idea of a dedicated app, this one has a way to go.
Version 5.93 2012-03-08 5
I am planning to travel to California this coming Spring break with few friends
And there was no way I know any good restaruants in California.
And I became to know this app and I loved it!
This really helped us to plan our trip :)

Thanks!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-22 1
The iPhone version of this app no longer supports location services. It is not working reliably for searches. The reviews by rating vs. distance does not switch. 

My biggest gripe is my favorite feature on the yelp app; it does not allow you to view searches on a map. A map view and the ability to update results by changes in map view would be ideal. 

Trip advisor reviews are more consistent and comprehensive than other review sites. I wish the app had better functionality.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
Unlike other apps for reviewing, this one gives more realistic reviews. As for this app, works better than the droid version I recently was using. Fast searches and better stability.
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 2
I love TripAdvisor, and the earlier iPad app was fantastic.  But I won't be using it much now, since this new version has disabled portrait view. No good reason for this change. It's less user friendly and less iPad friendly.  One of the great things about iPad apps is their ability to work however one is holding the iPad.

Hopefully this bug will be fixed in an update soon!  I do love TripAdvisor.

Thanks.
Version 5.5 2011-04-18 5
This app is very helpful because when you type in the location where you wanna visit it gives you many hotels to stay at around the area && it also gives you places to eat at && many also many attractions.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-16 5
Never forget to use it when in a new place! I use Trip Advisor to find restaurants, hotels, atractions wherever I go! The interresting thing is that even in small towns in many countries there are lots of good recomendations and options!
Version 5.8 2011-09-15 5
Great app for finding hotels and restaurants. The fact that real people apparently review each review before it appears on TripAdvisor helps weed out shills and impostors, making reviews that much more dependable.
Version 8.3 2013-12-25 4
I always check trip advisor before I try a new restaurant. One of my fav apps. I'd give it 5stars if it was more accurate as far as navigation goes in a big city. Got lost trying to find specific restaurants when I used it in NYC, but then again, it could've been my own err.
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 3
I guess I need help and can't find, on the app, where to get help.  I've written 3 reviews now and keep getting the same message (take care of something in red; although there is NOTHING in red) and the app will not post my review.  I am signed in.  Very frustrating in that regard.  Bringing up nearby things to do and hotels and other services is very nice, however.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-12 5
For an app I think it's useful perhaps others are expecting too much.  It makes traveling easy especially when looking for somewhere to eat.
Version 5.93 2012-03-03 5
Love using this app to find the best places to stay coastal. I found different places to stay through this app which was nice!! I love researching for just the right place for the right price and tripadvisor is just a great tool for travelers!!
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
This is the best app I have ever used for travel. I check out every hotel and know after a few reviews if I want to stay. Ditto on the restaurants. Things to see never let me down. This is a must have app if you travel at all
Version 6.6 2013-01-04 5
Guys what can I say I download lots of travel apps and this is the best one so far. that I have seen it gives you pictures prices and even use you other competitors names to look up prices like hotwire or Expedia love it
Version 8.2 2013-12-09 5
Ai Fiori - we've dined in some of the greatest restaurants in Istanbul, Paris, San Francisco, NYC and Charleston. And Ai Fiori is hands down the best dining experience we've ever had. The food, the service, the attention to details- the best. If you are in NYC do yourself a favor and go.
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 4
I used this app multiple times on a recent trip, and was very pleased. We found some great restaurants to try, as well as some entertaining attractions in the area we stayed in. I would like to see some additional features in the future, such as being able to mark points on a map that I have visited.
Version 5.9 2011-11-17 4
Arrived on cleveland oh ... Group asks, "what is there to do around here?"... Searched the net for "things to do on cleveland" . Trip adviser was first link... Not bad... Not bad at'all! Links to pics , reviews, and all found is with more than we could see! I didn't see a way for me to add to the list of places to visit though.
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 4
I love TA, and find this app extremely useful for checking reviews.  Anything further, however, and I would still use the site.  Map issues and difficult navigation make it difficult to use if trying to book a hotel.  Overall, solid 4 star app!
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 1
TripAdvisor has apparently decided it is not important for people to use the map to do searches for hotels anymore.  They had a great interface in the previous version, but they have seen fit to "simplify" it to the point of uselessness.  Gone is the ability to pan the map and have your search applied to a new area.  Gone are the excellent filters for refining your search.  What are you thinking TripAdvisor? The app is essentially useless for me now!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
This app works well on my iPhone 3. Loads quick, handy control layout, and all the regular Tripadvisor features are there and easily accessed thru the limited screen of the phone.
Version 6.6 2013-03-11 5
It's great to sync my travel plans, thoughts, whims across my devices. The user content is generally well done, but often the extremes can pull it one way or another.
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 5
I like using tripAdvisor to check places out before I go. Usually when I don't, I get burned. At least a little. TripAdvisor is usually right on with everyone's ratings, and having this at hand is awesome.
Version 6.1 2012-05-02 5
We have used this app to find restaurants and hotels on the go, and to plan some amazing vacations.  It is easy to use, and the personalized information provided by other users has been very helpful.
Version 6.2 2012-06-29 5
We travel a lot both international and domestic and find TA indispensable.    Only caveat is that often value travelers skew ratings lower for upper end dining/ hotels.  A filter for rating unrelated to value would be nice.
Version 6.6 2013-01-04 5
We use TripAdvisor exclusively on all of our road trips. Wouldn't leave home without it! Mobile app is sometimes a bit tough to make reservations, but it's always our starting place.
Version 5.7 2011-07-30 5
What did we do before tripadvisor! This app has totally made our vacation! Atlanta can be so big, but having the city at our fingertips helped us to relax and be spontaneous...just like a break should be! Thanks tripadvisor!
Version 5.9 2011-10-30 4
Just got this app the other night. Were planning on visiting springfield IL in a couple weeks. It's helped us narrow down some hotels, restaurants and things to do. It'll be great to use when were on the road and don't have access to a computer to look this information up.
Version 6.4 2012-08-20 5
We use for assistance on trips to check on hotels, eating places, adventures etc.  The reviews are only as good if we input them. Also very important that the place being reviewed be allowed to review, show correction or refute
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
It does what it says, nice thing about it is that it compares prices between other companies and usually saves you the time. Great to read comments from others that will help you when visiting a place!
Version 8.2 2013-12-03 5
I travel extensively for business. I have come to rely on trip advisor to find great rates on motels and meals. I like the fact that  they publish both good and bad reviews. They have really made life on the road a lot better for me
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-10 5
This app really helps me. I travel a lot, and I appreciate the depth of information, as well as then number of reviews available in many "out of the way" places. It improves my travel experience!
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
Downloaded this right before vacation and used it everyday to find hotels and restaurants.  I impressed the rest of the family with how quickly I got information on where we were going.  Great app.
Version 6.6 2013-01-17 5
This is the best tool on the Internet for checking hotels.  I always check before I stay anywhere. I have written numerous reviews and am frank and truthful about the accommodations  and the tourist attraction.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 3
It has potential, and is still informational, but it is very buggy. For example, clicking your saves will open up a random location in the list instead of the list itself. And often it will say it can accurately map a location even with an address. The map as stated in other reviews is not great. A little more work and this could be great.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-25 5
I have tried other rating apps and this is the best. More trustworthy than Yelp who has unscrupulous business practices. Urban spoon doesn't let you rate like Trip Advisor. My fav: Trip Advisor for both U.S and Europe.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-28 5
Don't use yelp. They make businesses pay them a premium to keep their five star ratings visible. Plus you can't even post reviews from their app! Trip advisor is simply better in every way.
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 5
Trip advisor is THE place to find all kinds of great info from travelers of all types. Read up and book -- enjoy and help keep it great by coming back and posting your own thoughts and experiences!
Version 6.6 2013-02-04 5
I travel around a lot for pleasure, be it in another country or a random road trip close to home. I don't go anywhere without checking Trip Advisor, and now it's in convenient app form! 
Love this thing.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-07 5
This is the site to always check before making plans. Always make sure to read several reviews. Especially check for people with a large number of reviews !!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 5
I was thrilled to be introduced to the iPad app for Trip Advisor!  It definitely made researching our trip easier!  Best part was all the information it provided on the main screen (sights to see, stay & eat) using the GPS!  Highly recommend.
Version 5.7 2011-08-01 5
I use this app and web site whenever I travel.  Our ferry was canceled and we couldn't reach our final destination.  I used the app to find a highly-rated hotel and booked it within minutes.  Hooray for TripAdvisor and iPhone!
Version 6.3 2012-07-14 5
This is the best app to use when looking for different places. I use it all the time, even locally. I love the reviews even more, it's not like yelp with all the crazy people and their idiotic reviews. Recommend highly.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-21 5
Somebody-more than likely lots of bodies, thought through this app and man did they do their homework.
Thank you! This is my go to for travel. Flights, hotel, restaurants...
It does it all and makes my life so easy.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Great app! I use this app non-stop when I travel to make the most of every trip. It's my favorite travel app by far. I also use the app locally to try different restaurants. Now that they added save functionality it's perfect!
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5
I love this app! It is so nice to be able to read others' reviews and make a judgement or decision from there I take everything with a grain of salt...but I like having this at my fingertips! I travel a lot and use this app all the time!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-10 5
I love, love, love this app.  Trip advisor is my first go to for hotels and restaurants or just about anywhere your thinking about going.  It has more photos provided by real people who have been to these locations.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-08 5
I recently uploaded several travel apps, and they were so confusing -I just gave up and deleted them.  TripAdvisor is easy and leads me to exactly what I am looking for!
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 4
I always use the app for restaurant and hotel reviews when deciding where to stay and where to eat. I have not been disappointed so far.  The app is sometimes a little slow to respond, and I have not found an easy way to give it a starting location other that my current one.
Version 5.7 2011-08-07 5
Reviews, links, maps, things to do, all in one app!!. Love it!! Before this app. I'd have to use google maps, them look up reviews and search whats nearby and then look for THOSE reviews too! This is awesome and RELIABLE!
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
I I have not been using the app long, but it is becoming my go-to app for travel recommendations. Easy and intuitive the app helps me get to where I want to go and helps me steer clear of where I do not want to go...
Version 6.1 2012-07-13 5
Tripadvisor has been our bible while visiting Charleston as well as many other Southern cities.  It's advice is always right on.
We've been able to receive many great deals on lodging-- really appreciate it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 1
This app is the WORST. Navigating through it is impossible. The links frequently don't work, and when you click links to get a list of the "next 10" hotels, the page that loads does not have anything listed. You're much better off using the website.  The inability to navigate effectively leaves you walking in circles and having to look at hotels over and over again to make sure you've considered all of your options. I can't say enough about what a pain this is...
Version 5.6 2011-10-07 3
If you're looking up info this is an excellent app, but of you're entering info and can't log in easily, you're hosed an have to start over. A simple loop back to where I was reviewing would've been nice. Actual review interface is clumsy and non-intuitive. Lots of smaller, neighborhood restaurants missing from list.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
As a frequent tracker, trip advisor is my bible and never steamed me wrong. I look up everything on it and nice to h e a phone app since carrying a large lap top just seems to be to much.  Thank you TA for keeping up with the times.
Version 5.8 2012-01-19 5
This place is one of the best, i loved the service  my waitress  gissele  nice girl and  the food. I ate a seafood combo that was so good and my drink was  2 x 1. Definitely I going to come back again thank you and I recommend this place and the server
Version 6.1 2012-09-18 5
This really helps when traveling to find restaurants, sights and hotels. It's great before, during and after a trip. I highly recommend it. I like how you can narrow your search to help even more.
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5
I love this app!  I always use it to research where I want to eat and stay and what I want to do when I travel. The reviews have never led me in the wrong direction.  I consider this app as a must have for anyone who wants to get the most out of their travels.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-29 5
Great app...very easy to use.  The extensive reviews makes planning and researching your travel much easier!  If you use the reviews then be sure to share your experiences as well!
Version 5.6 2011-05-19 5
Trip Advisor is by far the most insightful and practical travel resource we've found.  We travel a lot for both business and pleasure and look to this website to find the best hotels and restaurants!  We've not been let down!
Version 5.8 2011-10-23 5
We travel a lot and if you really want to know what you are getting into be sure and get this App to use TripAdvisor. The photos and user reviews are very helpful. I have been a much more savvy traveler due to this site and App!
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Everything I wanted and more, no problems accessing any features, great for travel and at home. Brochures and websites tell you what you want to hear, TripAdvisor tells it like it is!
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 3
It's difficult to complain about a free app so I won't. It's useful. I'd just like to see more locations on it & camp grounds. I'd also like to be able to see where I am on the map and to get rid of the pull down screen that lists things. I use camp & rv, an inexpensive app, but it doesn't  list restaurants and things to do.  A blend of the two would be great.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-06 5
I use this app everyday. I have probably read over 500+ reviews and continue to check everyday for new reviews. Just remember to take the good with the bad and don't get stuck on one bad review.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
Trip advisor is full of the best trip app available. If you're traveling without it, you are not traveling right. Grab this app and enjoy ann the hidden gems each city has to offer.
Version 5.8 2011-10-18 5
How could a travel app be so realistic and well developed that it makes you want to run to the airport and hop on the next flight to go exactly where you know you you're going!!! Splendidly excellent!
Version 8.5 2014-02-28 4
When we go anywhere we always do our research on trip adviser prior to going. Nice app to use before going and we always write reviews and add pictures to help others as well. Only con is that some of the google directions are not accurate. Overall very useful!
Version 5.8 2011-10-15 5
Great app!  Drove 6 days cross country and always check trip advisor for help in deciding points of interest, hotels, food!  Feels like you know about the places you're visiting before you ever get there.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 5
OMG I would normally stay a lot of other places but we started checking my husband in there for just a few hours rest being a Truck Driver and SALINAS GOOD NITE INN was great for rest, parking, and clean!!!! Great stay and courteous staff! Thanks Tobias for faxing too!
Version 6.6 2013-02-26 3
I use the TA for both writing and searching for places..  For the search it needs to have more filters/options to find what you are looking for.  
For posting reviews it is not the same as the website, can't rate individual categories, can't see previous reviews etc.  to see if I wrote it, what I wrote, etc.

Good app could just use some improvements
Version 5.93 2012-02-29 5
I prefer tripadvisor to most other review based sites because I think it more accurately represents the users opinion.
Some other sites push businesses to pay to have reviews filtered and that dilutes the validity of the ratings.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 5
In a new town?  Not sure what to do?   Trust Trip Visor to give you plenty of options.    Even if you have lived there for years you will find new things to do all the time you didn't even know about.
Version 8.3 2014-01-04 5
I use this on every trip and even out pit stops along the way. It always steers us to a great restaurant, a clean hotel or a great sightseeing opportunity. A must if you travel with kids.
Version 6.2 2012-06-29 5
App works week and helpful on vacation but looking forward to future enhancements to make it even easier to use and find thing quickly
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-27 4
I like the reviews and I find them very helpful. They come from real people and I often submit my own review.  I find its a good way to let hotels and Resturant know how they are doing. I find a lot of hotels and restaurants read their reviews and respond. I find that powerful.
Version 8.3 2013-12-23 4
I use this app to check out hotel reviews and pics - checking out forums is a bit clunky though.  When hitting the "back" button it always takes you back to the beginning...making the process longer than it needs to be.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 4
As an avid traveler, trip advisor is one of the tools I use in deciding on travel. It gives you great idea of location and price so yo can narrow down to the options you are serious about. I get hesitant about the reviews sometimes but all in all this app is perfect or the avid or casual traveler.
Version 8.4 2014-02-01 5
Trip Advisor is the "go-to" resource for this well-travelled couple when planning international trips. We so appreciate and benefit from the travel tips of others who are curious to explore new places and have an appetite for adventure.
Version 8.5 2014-03-29 5
A helpful app on the road - actually easier to use than the web site. I use it both for reading and writing reviews. I'd suggest adding a way to save reviews for later submission.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 3
The content from trip advisor is great. The app adds the location based service you'd expect. UI could use a little improvement as the reviews/overview in left pane, map in right doesn't quite make sense.  Also, lots of back clicking if you're digging into reviews.  Again, great content and definitely worth getting if you're traveling.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
Highly recommended - I find this App so useful to find good places to stat, eat and visit in my travels worldwide..the more that use it, the better it gets.
Version 6.6 2012-10-02 4
When it comes to not-too-developed tourist destinations, things come out, probably because of inaccuracies in maps.
And the overall UI, I think it can be better.
Of course the tripadvisor content is essential, just hope better user experience
Version 8.5 2014-02-25 5
My wife and I use this app for almost all of our trips. From our two week Hawaii honeymoon to our regular date nights, TripAdvisor and it's peer reviews have always resulted in a good time. Thanks TripAdvisor Team!
Version 6.6 2012-11-10 5
I wish they had more price info for locations. Overall this is a rare app in that quite simply it works. Reviews are up to date and pictures are easy to browse.
Version 6.6 2013-03-30 5
The App is a fully functional extension of the website. I use it for recommendations of hotels, restaurants, and sightseeing. I try to give back with worthwhile, accurate reviews.
Version 7.1.1 2013-10-02 2
This has been a great app, a great resource for finding hotels when traveling, but the version not only changed the layout (not an improvement), it's buggy, if you move location on the map or magnify a location it will not identify hotels like the older version did. On one screen it logged me off.

Please fix this app, I've had to go back to Google to find hotels I want in an area.
Version 6.1 2012-04-12 5
We enjoy being able to read real reviews by people that have actually experienced what we would like to do. I especially like giving others the same chance to review my experiences. Great site!
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 4
This app makes it so easy to check places out before booking. I always check on the Mac but now I can just use the app to check out the places we are considering whether it s for dinner or a stay. TripAdvisor never steers me wrong!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-21 4
I used TA first on our honeymoon to a new area, and it was by far the best source for info on attractions & places to eat. Other reviewers comain about out-of-date info, but this has never been an issue for me.

Wonder if it's good overseas; I could've used it on some other trips I've taken.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
I'm using trip advisor for the first time to go to europe. I love all the information & details that disclose to the users. This application make's it so much easier to find by map location. This app will make my trip unforgettable.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 5
This app has been very helpful whether going on vacation or just trying a different restaurant around town. Definitely has made vacations more enjoyable!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-08 5
I always use TA for any trip planned. The info from the site and the reviewers is insightful and very helpful. I count on it to be my eyes before I make a decision. Thank you for maintaining a great app!
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5
Have used Tripadvisor's website for years, finding quite valuable, accurate reviews and recommendations. Now I'm thrilled with their app on my iPhone. So convenient, and helpful !
Version 6.2 2012-06-14 5
very easy to use, gives you exactly what you are looking for, excelent when you're travelling and it even helps you discover great places or thing to do near where you live!
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 5
We have used this travel ap throughout Spain and it has consistently provided us with fabulous food and exactly the type of hotel we wanted.  If we want budget or best, it offers great advice.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-06 5
A traveler's best friend. Think of it as a better yelp for everything you'd ever need when you adventure the world. Just amazing. Better than any book you could buy.
Version 5.6 2011-05-17 4
Found this app today while planning a summer trip and wow it's really useful and packed full of info. My wish list: a mapping function that would tell me how far an attraction or restaurant is from my destination, better filtering, and an itinerary planner.  Otherwise phenomenal app for it's free price tag!!!!!
Version 8.2 2013-12-17 5
This is the best app with the most reviews.   Don't rely on the outlier reviews like the really bad ones or the over-the-top ones that are short. The most informative reviews are the ones that give specific details of the stay.
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
You just have to remember that one man's junk is another man's treasure.  The recent reviews are more valuable than old ones.  Star ratings are not everything.  Look for consistent compliments or complaints among several reviews.
Version 6.1 2012-04-22 5
I travel for Orkney and enjoy reading several reviews on a place to get an overall picture and look for any red flags. Then I always try to write my own so I can pay back the favor and possibly help someone else.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 5
Great way to find what you are looking for in a city. 
You used to be able to look at individual ratings. Like if you just wanted to read the one star reviews you could. I hope they bring that back.
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
I have found some of my favorite places  to stay and eat using Trip Advisor -- from my favorite boutique hotel in South Beach, Miami to a bed and breakfast we loved in Venice, we have had great luck by using reviews on this site.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
I have only just started using this app and it already outshines all the paid for apps I bought for my trip, as far as organizing my info into a useful format. I can't wait to take this app out on the road. Thanks!
Version 6.6 2013-02-01 5
I use it whenever we travel. I'd rather find places and read reviews that others have posted. I go and then post my thoughts. So far, those who use and rate places are very fair and honest. What else are you looking for?
Version 6.6 2013-04-09 5
Get the app whether before you go or once you arrive.  You'll have great information on food reviews to leverage for your stay.  Use them to enjoy the experience of your vacation.
Version 6.1 2012-04-05 1
I'm a huge fan of TripAdvisor.  I love the website.  I used to love this app.  But since the update, they have completely broken its utility.  Bing maps are awful.  The app does not keep your location after looking through a few listings.  So if you, say, try to browse through restaurants in a city, it will suddenly arbitrarily limit your search to within a tiny area of that city with no prompting on your part.  This makes the app practically unusable.  This is a huge bug and it needs to be fixed ASAP.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
I am addicted to trip advisor. Travel is our passion as a couple. I am always checking out before the trip to organize it better and also during... Love it. Highly recommended!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 5
This app provides wealth of information and reviews about any place I'm visiting or plan to visit. The reviews provide dependable guidance on things of interest, hotels, restaurants.
Version 5.93 2012-03-29 5
Love it , it works efficiently , perfect travel guide. One thing to add maybe is navigation for anywhere in the world, just a thought, coz I still love the app. I rate it 10 stars ********** and one more thing if I could save the pages I like and print ;-)
Version 8.5 2014-03-05 5
Always excellent for hotels and restaurants. Now I've booked a vacation rental in Paris, through TripAdvisor App, and am very pleased.
Version 5.93 2012-03-12 5
I cannot tell you how happy I have been with the app. Recently traveled to florida keys and trip advisor never did us wrong!! Will never travel without this app again! Thanks for the great suggestions (and memories)!!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-22 5
Tries writing a review of the (awesome) Newland Hostel in Dalat, Vietnam using the Trip advisor app but the review did not show up on the review page. Possibly it takes a while for the review to be visible to other Trip Advisor users.
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
Best travel app and website need I say more? I love the new point in direction of place of interest it's like a gps that points you whe you need to go but with a simple arrow like a compas it's quite cool.
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 3
Personally, I LOVE the tripadvisor website so was excited for the app but I think it's missing a couple key components to make it great. First, you can't see things you've done on the website & secondly, I wish you could also save or bookmark forum discussions in case you quickly want to go back & find something you read.
Version 8.5 2014-03-19 4
Trip Advisor is a great resource when trying to decide on a hotel or restaurant, or exploring a new city. Only downside is that average reviewers often don't seem to know much about ethnic cuisine, so their opinions are not very helpful if you are an adventurous diner likee.
Version 6.4 2012-09-06 5
This app has been so helpful in a very small, rural destination. We have found the overall reviews to be accurate and to the point. We won't travel without it now!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-30 5
Love this app! One of our most loved and used! My wife and I are International Flight Attendants. So we're always eating over sea's. It's important to get a great meal and know where to go! This app is "The Map"!! Come, See, Conquer!! And have fun doing it!!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-27 5

Version 5.9 2011-11-21 5
If I could have only one travel app - this would be it. The hotel ratings are spot-on and hotel owners that "get it" pay attention to their reviews here. No marketing fluff- just candid reviews from people like you.
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 5
On a driving vacation trip and using this app all the time on my iPad and iPhone. Quite handy to find the local scoop and even writing my own reviews of the establishments we use. Makes the trip even more interesting.
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 4
Was looking up hotels for upcoming trip to Italy. Tour company already booked hotels. TripAdvisor app has provided more realistic (vs. marketing) expectations!!! Some appear better rated than others. At least  I can still plan appropriately re: wifi, shower size & small rooms.
Version 6.6 2013-04-05 5
Whenever we take a trip anywhere Trip Advisor is the first app or website I visit. We have found many different and interesting places we wouldn't have found otherwise. Thank you Trip Advisor.
Version 5.8 2011-10-08 5
Totally loving it, I've discovered new places even in the city I have lived all my life ! & it's free . This app is a MUST on everyone's iPod/iPhone .
However, Lets not forget about the ONE &ONLY Steve Jobs , without you nothing of this would be possible ! R.I.P. <3
Version 5.8 2011-10-21 5
I have Ben traveling to Spain for the past 15 years and this time I used tripadvisor.  It helped me rediscover the country all over again. I love it and recommend that you don't leave home without it
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
Every reader must sort through the angry writers for true ratings. Some people missed their flight, lost luggage, etc and take it out on the resort or whatever.  Trip Advisor is my travel "go to" resource, wherever I go
Version 8.3 2013-12-27 5
This app and website are my best friend. This should be the most trusted site ever! Candid comments are the most helpful when planning a travel and this app/site is the only place I look to, use, and trust! Love trip advisor
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 4
Getting regular people's opinions is always the best and you make it easy. You are missing a star because if I want to look at the 1,953 photos of the resort I always have to start at the beginning. Can you make some sort of jump button where you skip 50 at a time?
Version 6.3 2012-08-07 5
Fast, easy and powerful tool to find places to stay, eat and visit when traveling. Cuts down on the number of bloopers, mistakes when you don't have time to find out the hard way.
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5
We have been traveling through Peru and the Trip Advisor App has been of great help!  We use it to plan the next step of our journey, since we do not enjoy traveling with a tour group.  Trip Advisor Is a terrific tour guide!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Unbelievably helpful in Many ways !,... You will know a lot about  the country you visit and the places you might not have known of even if you have done a research on the country you intend to visit!.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 4
I recently got into Trip Advisor during a trip to Chile. The app helped me out a lot. After a few experiences I started leaving reviews of my own that I felt would be helpful to others. Now I have even added new establishments to Trip Advisor! Overall a good app for on the go recommendations.
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 5
If you want the best traveling guide app then look nowhere else. This will really make your travel in any country in the world the best travel experience. I ALWAYS depend on this app it become like a part of me.
Version 5.4 2011-08-13 5
I'm in Denver right now for the weekend and don't make a move without consulting TripAdvisor. Yesterday we had two fantastic meals thanks to TripAdvisor. We were at Larimer Square, used the TripAdvisor app, and voila found great places to eat.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 5
Always use this app and website whenever travelling abroad. Has all the information from hotels, things to do, reviews, photos etc. for virtually any destination in the world !
Version 6.1 2012-05-26 5
Real reviews by real travelers, good, bad, ugly.  Trip Advisor has been a game changer for this frequent traveler.  No more surprises, always know what to expect, and a great way to discover hidden gems.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 4
I have written reviews regularly, but it now tells me that I cannot re-review a restaurant within a month. However, my reviews were written a year ago. They seem not to be able to recognize the year of review. However, when they do get it right, the app is useful with useful reviews.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-20 5
This app is great for the novice traveler. I just started a new position within my company that requires me to travel and I always refer to Trip Advisor for ratings on hotels and good places to get a hot meal.

I STRONGLY recommend this app!
Version 8.4 2014-02-01 5
I used to plan meals/dining out with family while on vacation. Super helpful!

Now that I'm back home, I use it yo plan trips as well as exploring my own backyard!
Version 5.92 2012-02-03 5
I am glad this app is on my IPad as I use it often. It is good info from the actual people who go to places and give their opinions. Of course, you still need to read several reviews to get an overall picture of the hotel or restaurant.
Version 6.2 2012-06-15 4
Great reviews and information.  Better than the mobile website.  However, a few limitations:
1) Most hotels it does not list phone, but sends you to Orbitz or Travelocity to make reservations.
2) Not all top sites are rated, but that is up to us users of the service to add them.
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 5
This is a must read site before booking any trips. It is always nice to get other people's perspective on what places are like before booking. We use it often before booking hotels we haven't stayed at before .
Version 6.6 2013-04-13 4
We've used this app successfully in the U.S., Barbados & Costa Rica and it's been ultra helpful. When visiting foreign countries, Be sure to see how many reviews are posted for a place & the overall rating before you "pull the trigger" & give them your hard earned money.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 4
The app could stand tweaking. The information could be a little better. When you put pics on these things, a picture of the outside is good, pictures of what the food looks like when it comes can be as important as the pictures of the inside and outside of the building.
Version 5.9 2011-12-24 4
I've only used this once on a recent trip to Fort Worth,TX. It seems to me that this app only shows some restaurants as there were no fast food joints that showed up for me. I'm not saying that this is a problem, but, if you are expecting this feature to show all restaurants, you may be disappointed.
Version 6.6 2012-12-21 5
All the conveniences of the website in an app...can't beat that. I overlooked that their might be an app, but as soon as I went to the mobile website it recommended the app!! Great way to make users aware of your various features..
Version 8.5 2014-03-21 5
We check Trip Advisor prior to any vacation we take. It's reviews on various hotels and attractions that travelers write generally prove to be very reliable. It's an excellent tool for researching your destination. My gf and I love it!
Version 5.91 2012-01-14 5
This app has the most concise, informative knowledge base, supplemented by their review system. Just take people's reviews with a grain of salt; not every establishment can be perfect all the time. Otherwise, a wonderful app!
Version 5.92 2012-01-19 5
Great app, one of the best I have evaluated. Travel with this on your phone or iPad and you will have a wealth of knowledge available to you. Easy to use and you will find yourself going to this app more and more.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 5
This is by far the best app to find things happening around you. A friend works for Trip Advisor and she told me about it a few months. I had never heard of them until then and now I'm in love :)
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
The near me now feature is awesome. It so quick to help you find a place to eat. My only complaint is the distance to the  restaurant seems off a little. Not enough to make this less than a 5 star app though.
Version 5.92 2012-01-27 5
I traveled to Savannah with kids and really appreciated the to do list for kids. Also, 
The "nearby" feature found us a great restaurant close to our last tour site.   The map helped me navigate the city with no problem.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-16 5
While preparing for a recent trip to Hilton Head Island, I came across this AP.  It's awesome!  When traveling With 4 kids, it's a must to find fun activities and good restaurants.  This AP does all that and more!  All in one search area.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 4
It's a very good crowdsourced travel site. Lots of reviews for many places ive looked and generally has at least a few recent reviews. 

Most useful for off the beaten path reviews. If I'm in NY or SF just ask a local.  I'm traveling a lot next month and will report.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 3
Easy to use on the go. Quick to find reviews of nearby restaurants, etc. iPad app looks slick but is somewhat annoying due to "home" just putting you out to screen where you have to choose restaurants/hotels/etc. Hard to enter a review from home screen for example. 

But overall is fine and does the job for a mobile app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 5
I love this app. I travel a lot and never know where to eat but trip advisor always helps. It is good to know what real people think about places before you spend your money. I never go anywhere without trip advisor.
Version 5.9 2011-12-13 5
I resisted downloading this app. Why did I need another app on my iPad when the website worked just fine? Well, the app works better and faster than the website, so I'm glad I finally downloaded it. The app is a pleasure to use.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
Once I saw that this app listed all hotels in one area and included the prices I was ready to recommend it to a friend. It's such a pain to go to each hotels site to find the price is out of my range. Love this app!  Defiantly recommend.
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5
As a former Travel Agent I find this site a must when visiting a new destination. I suggest reading 5 to 10 reviews to get a true picture. We have been very pleased with all of our selections using Tripadvisor.
Version 6.0 2012-03-15 5
Love the way you get information while looking and moving the map.  Perfect way to see photos of the hotels, restaurants and attractions.  No surprises :)

Very user friendly.  Great tool for planning a trip.  I'm glad I have it!!
Version 6.6 2013-03-27 3
The app and mobile presence both need help, fast. The inability to do much of anything other than browse is tough. For people searching its great but the reviewers matter too. At this point mobile needs to be just as capable as desktop. "View Full Site" means not enough focus on mobile. Please increase features!
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 5
Decided to get this app on my iPhone and iPad and it is a must for trip planning, travel snafus, hotel and restaurant recommendations and ratings, especially since we travel by car and change our minds often!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-16 5
We travel a lot and planning is so much easier with TA!  Love the hotel reviews and trip forums.  I arrive at my destination feeling much more confident and ready to see and do everything possible!
Version 5.93 2012-03-16 5
Whether it was finding a hotel, or something to do, this app has shown again and again to me how amazing it is. My friends and I go on a lot of random poor planned vacations and this app is perfect for it. As well as if you just need something to do.
Version 5.5 2011-04-18 5
We consult Trip Advisor all the time when we're on the road. While we take individually wide-ranging user reviews with a grain of salt, the overall ratings are useful and the access to information indispensable.
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 4
I like this trip advisor app. It is easy to write & submit a review for the most part. I do wish it had the same format for submitting a review as the regular website with dates that you visited whatever you reviewed. Also, I would like to be able to view my past reviews submitted.
Version 6.6 2012-12-05 5
Being new in a city one would love to have a personal guide resource that works out everything from landmarks, to hotels and where to find food. Tripadvisor just cuts it for me.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 5
The app is a bit hard to navigate, and hotel filtering took time to figure out, but the reviews and ranking information was indispensable on our trip.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 4
I LOOOOOVE TA!! And their app makes it that much easier for me to hop around the world.  The latest release is a bit buggy though. When you click the "star" to add to favorites, it tries to open the map and directions.  That is a vital piece of the app, please fix. :)
Version 5.4 2011-04-14 4
There have been so many occasions where this app has been invaluable in showing good restaurants when we were stuck for options. 

Only downside I would say is that it lists too many tour companies in the "Things to do" in some Russian cities... Which makes those "top" ratings dubious.
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
This is great from flights to hotels to dinner this is a great app that I have been using for a long time and will use many more times. I have saved probably thousands from this. I highly recommend this app. To every one!
Version 6.2 2012-07-15 5
When planning vacation to San Diego I used trip report and the reviews to help select hotel based on the top rated by other travelers. I felt safe booking the locations since we did no know area.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-12 5
Excellent app for travel or stuff around town. You get the real picture from real customers before you get there and then you have the fun of spouting off your own reviews! Good app! Join the fun!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-12 5
So far, so good!  I downloaded this app while on a business trip to Germany to help find some local fun stuff to do. It's working great so far, seems stable and has useful features like "point me to it."
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-14 5
Use before I make a reservation or buy a show ticket. I know there are always people that are difficult to please. So you need to look past their options. But generally most options are dead on.
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 5
Kept saying remind me later because I definitely wanted to praise this app, but was using it SO MUCH the review reminder got annoying so here goes! Love saving hotels and easy to navigate reviews, photos, etc.
Version 6.5 2012-09-15 3
I am a frequent user and contributor to Trip Advisor. However, I find the App to be frustrating. It lacks the following features: 
1. Inability to search reviews by Facebook friends.
2. Inability to search for one's own reviews.
3. Inability to see or edit one's Trip Advisor travel maps.
You can do better Trip Advisor!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-10 5
Any time we try someplace new, whether it be a hotel, restaurant or other large attraction, checking Trip Advisor is a must!  I appreciate the honesty of others and the ease of navigating through the site.  Thank you!
Version 5.9 2011-11-21 4
I travel frequently for work and do not like carting along my laptop on overnight trips

The trip Advisor app gives me the ability to do everything (save for review on a place that has not made the list) 

I have had great success Trip Advisor reviews and yhe app is a great addition.
Version 5.9 2011-11-24 5
On 3 week holiday to Thailand and Tripadvisor app has saved me a fortune financially, in potentially lost time, and user reviews on accom far more reliable than websites marketing and fancy photos! Love it.
Version 5.6 2011-05-23 4
This app is awesome. Just downloaded and within five minutes I had several things to do, a couple of restaurants, and a hotel saved for a trip to San Fran. Also the search bar was extremely useful, found an unusual request for Vegas instantly. Definitely will use this app over and over.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 5
I liked the application for a quick check only. I prefer the website for details lookup. It is my reference before I make any reservation. I really rely ans depend on it. Also, I am addicted to it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-02 4
It's a pretty great app, but I would like it  to be easier to filter a search from activities to restaurants etc. still trying it out so we'll see. Not bad though and I can definitely see us using it on our trips and planning!! :)
Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5
I love it. Gives you the information you need and plus more. It's-wonderful reading comments coming from the people who actually experienced the places, the food, the hotels. Deciding is not easy though. Haha.
Version 5.93 2012-02-27 5
I'm a pilot for UPS. Fly all over the world. Trip Advisor is by far the best at giving you the info you need to make a good trip a great trip. Love all the amateur photos of hotels. Gives you a true picture of what it looks like. A+ Site/App
Version 6.2 2012-07-04 2
I use this app a lot less than I used to. I do not like the landscape only view. I don't have a Facebook account, because I don't want one, yet it asks me to sign into Facebook every time! Can I have the option to turn that off?

When I get interested in a listing and want to zoom in it using the map, the listing change. Aggravating

In summary all of the 'enhancements' aren't improving what was already a great app.
Version 6.6 2013-01-27 5
Don't make plans without looking at TripAdvisor first .... Plain & simple information for making any trip or dining...

get the best info from fellow travelers as they experienced and were treated.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
I rely on this constantly to make decisions on where to eat!! And what to do!! When on vacation I have a rule that I will not eat at a chain restaurant, therefore I rely on trip advisor to tell me where to go. I have never been steered wrong!!
Version 8.5 2014-03-06 4
I love the Trip Advisor website. The Mobil app is very good for when you're on the road, but would be great if it had more of the individualized content of the full website.  Either way, I appreciate what Trip Advisor provides and remain a loyal fan!
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 4
Very useful tool, especially to pinpoint exact location of hotels, read reviews and compare price/ value.
However it annoyed me that for booking you need to use external links. And one has to start search over.
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 5
TripAdvisor is probably one of the best apps available for reviewing and searching for things to do around you. I find it amazingly easy to work with and know you will as well.
Version 6.6 2013-04-24 5
I love and use this on a regular basis. I travel extensively and use this for dining at least 3 times a week. So much better than urbanspoon, whose GPS app rarely has any accuracy.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 5
Always reliable and usually very acurate about the places to visit. The only issue is that some people will try to ruin the reputation of some hotels or restaurants because of one mistake.
Version 6.3 2014-02-01 5
I use this to prepare for all of my hiking trips.  It is very fast and straightforward. Some of the older apps are a bit encumber some.  I will stick to this one, especially for the roads less travelled.
Version 5.92 2012-01-19 4
I am thinking about going on a vacation yo California because it's been a place i've always wanted to go to. Problem is I don't know what California has to offer and this app is helping me out a lot. Thank you very much for the lists of stuff to do and so on. In my opinion this is better than JetSetter.
Version 6.1 2012-07-07 5
The ability to filter properties by type then drill down to reviews and pictures really simplifies choosing vacation spots that meet our needs. Terrific app!
Version 6.6 2013-03-15 5
My husband and I travel a great deal.  We started using TripAdvisor two years ago and we look up everything when we are planning a trip.  I can't believe anyone would travel without it!!!
Version 6.6 2013-03-15 1
Sort of like TA reviews.   Some are good ( look for reviewers who have posted a lot in the forums and also those who give evidence that they actually travel). Yelp, chow hound, que are much better.  TA is okay on hotels, not so great on restaurants.  Ignore attraction reviews, head for forums ( again, some are good, but....well, if you are relying on TA reviews to plan trips, you might want to supplement with other sites). Regular TA much more usable than app.
Version 8.3 2014-01-03 5
First time ever using TripAdvisor to help me plan a birthday date/gate away and I had gotten great ideas! This app makes everything very simple, and easy to use/understand. I know I'll be using this app soon enough!
Version 6.2 2012-06-12 1
Here's how Trip Advisor works.  

On a recent trip down I-95, my wife and I stayed at 2 hotels.  The first was a Residence Inn which I reviewed and gave 4 stars out of 5.  The second was a Best Western which was a terrible experience.  I reviewed it and gave it two stars.

The positive review was accepted and posted.  I received an email confirming the post.  The second mysteriously got lost in cyberspace.  

I guess the hotels don't like paying to be listed if they get bad reviews.  But, the net of it for me is that this is a useless tool.
Version 6.6 2012-12-17 5
Tripadvisor has always provided complete and reliable information on my travel questions. Now this app has made it even easier to get info
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 5
I like this app cause it is easy to use. Even if you have lived in the same place the whole time. If you have an out of town guest you can let them look through it and pick something out to do.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-23 5
I go to trip advisor all the time to look up restaurants and hotels. It is nice to see what others have experienced. The trip advisor app is easy to use and I enjoy writing my own reviews as well.
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5
My number one travel app, I love the reviews from real, honest people. It really helps me when planning my travels, especially abroad. I also like to contribute my own experiences. Must have app!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
This app is much better than other travel apps simply because the reviews are honest. Some travel sites are a little quick with the editing scissors--not so with Trip Advisor. That's why I respect and trust my vacations to Trip Advisor.
Version 6.6 2013-03-04 5
We use this when traveling and decided to check out our home town.  Found a new restaurant I did not know existed..

They have always been right on the dime for the rating.
Version 6.6 2012-11-26 5
I use Tripadvisor as a trusted data point.  Found some 'not so obvious' gems during our travels.  What is a better data source than the collective input of many, aggregated in one place.
Version 6.6 2013-02-18 5
Where to stay, what to see and where to eat! All rolled into one convenient app. User reviews you can trust by people like you that live to travel and enjoy life. A must have app for the avid traveler!
Version 8.2 2013-12-03 5
I use Trip Advisor whenever traveling. It's great to see what people have been saying about businesses that I may not be familiar with. Reviews always seem to be recent, which I find helpful as well.
Version 5.4 2011-06-06 5
Don't speak the language, and know nothing about the people... This is it.
I have gone to jungle countries knowing nothing except trip advisor and some wiki and enjoyed myself immensly. Trip Advisor is heady!
Version 3.0 2009-11-18 3
Great app wonderful idea need to add the ability for users to update information.  It isn't bad to begin the database with some basic starting information but unless you are going to send scores of people around to verify and update information you have to give users the ability to either update their own or customers to add their favorites.
Version 5.5 2011-05-08 4
The app is great - except it must rely on users using it (writing and reviewing) in whatever area you want to be in order to get much use. I only have a WiFi only iPad, but I imagine it would (along with any other type of map-based program) be much more useful with 3G or 4G.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-10 2
This was my favorite app and I use it a lot. However two features I use often are broken in this version:
1. Near me feature: after selecting a restaurant and returning to list it loses the sorting by distance an it reverts to sorting by rating. Only fix I found is to go back to home screen.
2. Filter by distance and sort by rating. Used to be easy, but can't figure out how to it anymore.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-13 5
I never book a room without checking the reviews on this site first! I love how I can read reviews from "real" people and not what someone in marketing came up with to entice me into staying! I recommend this to everyone!
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 5
In brief: EVERY THING you can imagine in "finding information about your trip" field, SURELY can be found in this App. This is really miracle!! Absolutely recommended. 
Tripadvisor,  and nothing else. That's all!
Version 6.6 2012-10-27 4
Only 2 problems I've noticed:

1. Translation option on the chrome browser is sorely missed for figuring out what the locals have to say.

2. Editing your profile... I can't figure out how to do that just yet on the app.

Otherwise it's pretty helpful.
Version 6.6 2012-12-17 5
I use this app mainly to research hotels because I am terrified of bugs or just uncleanliness. I guess Im a bit of a germaphobic. This app gives me everything I need in choosing a hotel that fit our needs. I love this app!
Version 6.6 2013-03-29 5
I love this app. It's extremely helpful with practically everything. It's like having somebody you 
personally know that will advise you re your travel plans. It's amazing!
Version 5.91 2012-01-14 5
Just tried it tonight; so convenient when I needed a restaurant for my gf's birthday dinner in a hurry! Narrowed my search, found the place and reserved it conveniently within 10 minutes. Keep up the awesome quality!
Version 6.3 2012-11-23 5
We rely on trip advisor whenever we travel. our experience with it has been excellent. If trip advisor gives a restaurant or hotel a good rating you can count on it.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
Love this app for hotels and restaurants. In addition to using it while we are away, it's a great way to find good places near home that you may have overlooked. Layout and design for iPad is better than TripAdvisor's actual website.
Version 5.9 2011-11-24 5
It's as good as the name implies... I really enjoyed and never regretted buying this app... A simple app to use.. If you are serious about trips and don't have the time to be asking people your way around, then trip adviser is your escort...
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 2
This app can be maddening to use. Been traveling past 3 weeks and the search/filter functions work poorly. It often removes my filtering requests and reverts back to showing me the #1, 2, 3 and so on restaurants. Not very useful in Paris with 8,000+ restaurants when I want specific types that fit a specific search request. Very frustrating to have to keep re-entering all the criteria. :(
Version 5.92 2012-02-20 5
This app is easy to use. I am able to access the information quickly and reliably without have to jump through numerous searches. One easy search platform.
Version 6.6 2012-11-01 2
The iPad version of Trip Advisor annoys the heck out of me, particularly using the map, which this app emphasizes highly. If you select a hotel on the map, say "J"' for instance, then zoom in for a better look at its location, after the zoom your hotel is no longer "J", but some other letter, and you have to go looking for it again. I found the web site on Safari much easier to use.
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 5
This app is just as wonderful as the full web version. It has great interface with Google maps, allowing you to find the restaurant/hotel after you've read the reviews.
Version 5.9 2012-02-18 5
This app is very fast, easy to use and full of great info. I use tripadvisor for every trip I take, whether personal or business travel. Laughing at the people who say they would never pay for this app again. Duh....it's free!
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 5
Very usefull when preparing to go to a new area of the country or one you have not visited recently. It's biggest strength is 
that the ratings are by many different people, not just professional critics.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
I am a traveling pro, commercial pilot dropping in anywhere anytime.  When I want a quick close meal, or if I don't have to walk a better selection TA IS RIGHT ON.  Extremely consistently reliable.  Worth it all the way
Version 8.5 2014-03-22 5
TripAdvisor is my go to app for things to do now or plan to do for a trip. Reliable ratings and reviews. Trip advisor takes the reviews as input of their users seriously and makes recommended changes timely.
Version 5.8 2011-11-05 5
Love this application for my iPad. It is easy to use and I was happy to find information about a small town I am visiting in a couple weeks to see a client. I will be using it frequently in my travels in the future!
Version 5.6 2011-08-11 5
This application is outstanding.  Hotel,restaurant and other important information for each stop on a road trip.  My wife and I find this tool invaluable as we plan our road trips around the country.
Version 6.6 2013-03-08 5
Traveling without this app (or website) is just unwise!  Find information, reviews & photos on even the most obscure hotels, restaurants or attractions.  Also share yours from this handy dandy app!
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
Great. Period. I dot know what people expect this app to do other than check hotel, air, and car availability. It does ll that amazingly at your finger tips. I guess the people who don't like this app would like the app to pay for their trip as well.
Version 6.6 2013-03-23 5
Now that I have found Trip Advisor, I do not do anything travel related without consulting it first.  If you do any traveling, for business or for fun, you must check out Trip Advisor!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
I have been using the web version for quite sometime and was stoked to find the app. I love all of the ways to search through the places I'll visit. So easy to navigate.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 4
I was browsing the forum, but there doesn't seem to be a way to go back to the listing of posts without reloading it (hence having to expand the "show 20 more" over and over again. A back button would be nice.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-26 5
I travel quite often and this app has helped me thoughtfully plan fun, adventurous, off-the-beaten path experiences. Couldn't imagine NOT using TripAdvisor for all my planning needs.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-21 5
Perfect when traveling alone to new, unfamiliar places. Always provides good suggestions for restaurants.   Love the "point me there" feature for walking or driving to the restaurant.
Version 6.1 2012-04-11 3
The app works great, but you cannot turn auto-translate off in the reviews, so it is almost impossible to understand the reviews. Please make the translation optional. The maps are ok, but the old map supplied by Google was better in europe. 
I like that with this app you can avoid the normal turist traps, and find the best offers out there. Thank you.
Version 6.1 2012-08-18 5
Love the site no doubt. We always check Trip Advisor before traveling, especially the ratings from others. We are beginning to write our own reviews which helps recall the trip even better!
Version 5.7 2011-08-16 5
Most useful app I own.  It's perfect for finding places on the go because it will use your current  location to find nearby hotel , restaurants, etc.  and of course the reviews are incredibly helpful.
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 5
Sometimes you can see that the very negative postings are done by a " friendly competitor"....and one should never rely on that...We don't.
Version 6.6 2012-10-10 5
App is great.  Ever friendly.  I often consult this app first when I am traveling for recommendations.  Always submit reviews because I so appreciate others reviews.  Non biased opinions are greatly appreciated.
Version 6.6 2013-03-30 5
We took a trip and used trip advisor to find the hotel and places to go. We had a great time. Took me a little time to realize I could not book hotels, but otherwise was invaluable for our trip.
Version 5.93 2012-03-04 4
Trip advisor has done a really great job with this app. It's better than their actual site so I often find myself doing trip planning on my phone rather than the computer. Images look great and searching through hotels and local attractions is pretty simple. Kudos!
Version 6.6 2012-11-08 5
This is the one app I refer to when traveling. Crowd sourcing has effectively made feedback on hotels restaurants and things to do always available and current. One of my favorite apps.
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 5
I rely heavily on TripAdvisor user reviews so it's great to have them right there on my phone. The only thing I would like to see added is the ability to narrow choices by proximity to a landmark (such as a train station).
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
So valuable to see recommendations from people from all different countries. The app just gets better as more people use it and write reviews. A must have for any international traveler!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-30 4
My daughter told me about trip advisor and I have been using it since January 2013 to travel to Switzerland , Missouri , Virginia and now Pennsylvania .  It has been very helpful to preplan and to check on last minute change of plans.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-22 4
The app is very useful (could have a better UI, for example for going back to the listing once you are in map view), although it crashes every now and then, but I still couldn't identify a pattern.
Version 6.6 2013-01-05 5
This is a great app for discovering and reading about places to travel to. Love the reviews and the suggestions it provides. Get this app if you travel or dream about travel. You will not be disappointed.
Version 6.6 2013-02-28 2
What needs improvement is you plug in a town and then it gives you a bunch of hotels, but no button to list them in order of rank by readers such as #1 to #20 and sometimes in foreign countries it picks hotels in other towns.  I don't mind groupings by price but how about a way to see them by top rankings by trip advisor.  I think phone ap is easier than iPad ap, unless that ap is changed also
Version 6.6 2013-03-23 5
I downloaded the city app while I was travelling and was very happy to find that the maps worked even without using data.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 4
This app helps me plan my days and dining experiences on trips. Very helpful for selecting hotels as well. Easy to enter reviews from IPad. Wish I could see all my behind the scenes data and reviews from my account like I can on the pc.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-14 5
This app seamlessly maps the restaurants, sites hotels so you can easily see proximity to where you are. In towns where you are simply looking for a good place to eat that is nearby, this is an absolute necessity!
Version 5.9 2011-12-26 5
This is why this app is cool: just booked a hotel through TA. Chose "street view" and was able to walk past the nearest restaurants in Paris with the ratings and reviews right there. Very convenient. Can't wait to check it all out in person.
Version 5.91 2012-01-23 5
I just got back from a trip to Austria and Germany and found trip advisor to be far more up to date and to offer a broader set of recommendations for hotels and restaurants.  Every recommendation was right on point.
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 5
I always read the reviews on trip advisor and find them to be real life, real world reviews. That's what I like the best -- no paid writers here; just honest, informative, and indispensable facts for any traveller!
Version 5.8 2011-08-31 5
Why even bother to buy a book. I love the comments by people like you and me and not some stuffy writer who had money to throw around. I give it 10 stars!!
Version 6.6 2013-03-07 5
Nice use of the iPad. Easy to get what you need. Great features. Ideally the filters could be a little more advanced... Like allowing weighting or ranking when using more than one filter.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 4
I enjoy writing reviews and reading others. They help me know what something is really like instead of only having the website to decide if it's worth a visit. 
App is easy to use searching for reviews and submitting reviews and photos!
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 4
Great app, don't know how I'd get along without it. Does just what it says. Solid running app. It's never crashed or locked up. Has even got me hooked on submitting reviews for others when ever I ran into positive or negative places in my travels.
Version 6.4 2012-09-09 5
This is my starting point for any trip I am planning!  Great info all in one place.  Things to do always opens up possibilities that I would have otherwise never thought of.  Definitely worth the download!
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 5
I've used it for Greece trip (4 islands) and found it very useful and accurate. Good site and good app. 

The scroll feature when writing a review can use a bit of work ( when writing actual review).
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
This is a great easy to use App and helps me to quickly and efficiently post reviews on places I have visited, restaurants I have dined at and hotels that I have stayed at.
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 5
One of my most used apps.  I live and die by this app for all my travel planning.  Only complaint is sometimes the words extend beyond the screen and you can't pinch it smaller
Version 5.6 2011-06-22 5
We were going on a trip to Savannah, so I thought I would try it. It was AWESOME!  The ratings were helpful and accurate. The maps were nice. A must for any trip!!!!!!!!  The only addition that would make it nicer, would be restaurant menus.
Version 6.6 2012-10-20 5
Every website that heavily depends on ratings has its drawbacks, but this is as close to an unbiased site to date.  The app compliments the site.  This app is my go to for quick reviews for hotels and restaurants.  Love it!
Version 6.2 2012-07-04 5
We turn to trip advisor for advice on accommodations, dining and things to do both before and during our trips. It's usually spot-on and better than urban spoon for dining options   Thank you!
Version 6.6 2013-02-17 4
You have to take the good with the bad. I'm always curious if I'm reading a legit review and not a marketing employee.

But it is nice to see real pictures, traveler's pics, that don't use a fisheye camera lens to make a room look big or ignore negative aspects.

good luck and safe travels
Version 5.93 2012-02-25 5
If you are looking for anything related to travel, tripadvisor will give you great insides from real people who already visit or/and had the experience that you are about to experience.
Version 5.92 2012-01-19 5
Such a well thought out ap is hard to find. I downloaded it and 15 minutes later was eating at a fantastic restaurant within walking distance from my hotel in Cambodia. Exactly what I needed the ap for.
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 5
If you are on a trip or just planning one, download this app now!  It works flawlessly on my iPad. The integration of maps, location, search, and a browser that opens within the app is pure genius... and it all works seamlessly!
Version 5.9 2011-10-31 4
Useful app while you're on vacation or traveling. The "near me" feature needs some refining, as it will pull up things in different towns. I like being able to upload pictures of the hotels, food, or whatever from my phone.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-24 5
Good information posted by travelers about just about anything! I enjoy adding my views. I appreciate the thoughtful comments of other reviewers.
Version 5.7 2011-07-27 5
I use this frequently for planning my travels and doing hotel research before booking. Love the features of user submitted photos of hotels, so that you can get an idea of what it actually looks like.
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
More often than not TripAdvisor has steered me away from bad places and towards good ones, whether it's a hotel or a restaurant. Only lately have I started giving ack by adding my own reviews ...
Version 5.8 2011-09-08 3
I like this app a lot but I live in Maputo, Mozambique and of the restaurants listed most of the ones I looked at on the map were misplaced even though the addresses seemed to be correct. Wish there was an option to request to move the map location like there is in Google Earth. There's only the option to let them know that the address is incorrect.
Version 5.92 2012-01-24 5
I use this every time I travel somewhere.  It's great for anything from finding a nice hotel, to things of interest in the area or great local places to eat at.  Couldn't imagine traveling somewhere with this app!
Version 6.6 2012-12-01 5
This app has been good for this old grandma. Easy to use and way to quick rate or het recommendations on the go. I can read the update from my own biz and respond on IPhone or Ipad. I really like it.
Version 5.7 2011-07-08 5
Awesome app I use trip advisor all the time and this app has made it easier and more accessible anywhere. Love the near me now option it is great for finding good restaurants, attractions, and hotels while on the road.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 5
How did anyone live in the day with no technology? Trip advisor makes my day go round! I think it's awesome. How do you plan anything without checking on trip advisor first? Ican't live without it!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 5
Have used this app for several years, rarely dies it steer you wrong on restaurants, motels or attractions! Easy to look up about anything for a quick look at many opinions.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-18 4
Trip adviser is a very reliable app; I always use it when traveling. I was using yelp for food reviews I have now switched over to using trip adviser they seem to be the more widely excepted applications for consumer reviews.
Version 5.9 2011-10-31 4
Trip Advisor is an excellent source when traveling. When reading the reviews you get a good insight to each establishment. But you must take the majority of reviews as the norm. Check the percentages of excellent to poor and make your judgement on the majority.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
I use Tripadvisor every time I plan a domestic or foreign trip. The plethora of reviews gives me good, objective information about hotels and things to do virtually anyplace we go.  It's an invaluable planning tool.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 4
I use this app all the time. Recently though, whenever I look up a hotel and try to view the photos, all I see is black. No photos show up. Being able to view the photos was one of the best features of the app. I tried re-loading the app and didnt help. Hope they can fix this.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
I use trip advisor for every trip.  It has always been honest and reliable when planning.  Love the new save feature on the map itself.  This has helped with an upcoming trip.
Version 6.6 2013-01-30 5
Really like this app, because it seems to be by real people not ads. I've read  some of the forums of places that I've been and they seem pretty good at the information being pasted on. I'll continue using it.
Version 6.6 2013-02-23 5
We have used trip adviser on the web for many years. I'm so very glad this mobile app works just as well.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-24 3
Trip Advisor got rid of one of the app's best features with this update. The 'What's Nearby' feature made it easy to find other hotels in the same general neighborhood, or restaurants/hotels near an attraction. The upgrade is simply more clunky than the previous version -- looks nicer, but isn't as intuitive or as good as it used to be.
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
I love this app. When I travel it is so nice to get help from other travelers who have been there previously. I am using this now to review my experiences while traveling.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 5
Trip Advisor (with a little help from Google) is a great travel companion! We rely on the user reviews to steer us to the best attractions when we are on vacation. So far, everything has been on the nose!
Version 5.9 2011-11-05 5
But stop asking me to flippin rate it so many times!!! 

This is everything you need to plan a trip. My boyfriend and I are going to the Keys next week and this has been invaluable in our planning process.
Version 8.2 2013-12-07 5
This app has been so valuable while planning a trip and when on the road. Saves time doing searches for a hotel or something. It is all right here at your fingertips.
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 5
Great app to get good information for any trip! We've used TripAdvisor to "scout" every holiday trip for the past 6 years and have learned by experience that you will find what you need to know right here
Version 6.6 2013-03-15 5
This site is one of the most informative sites for travel in the world.  The information can be trusted and valued.  This site makes international Travel a meaningful and enjoyable experience.
Version 5.7 2011-08-29 5
LOVE the app & always check for lodging, food & things to do prior to any travels.  Have found their information to be accurate and informative.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
I plan every aspect of my trips with trip advisor. Good for local activities to Europe, Hawaii everywhere. The hotel info is always dead on. Now I got it on my iPhone and iPad. So many junk apps but NOT this one.
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 4
I just installed this app. Biggest negative is the inability to increase the font size when the location map is open on the right side of the screen, also having to start over when searching for airfares. Overall, though, this is a valuable tool to have for the iPad.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-25 5
When traveling anywhere and even in your own city this app will let you discover places you didn't even know where there. Don't go anywhere without this app!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
I always go to Trip Advisor before traveling. Best reviews, good pictures, etc.  After traveling, I always rate the hotel, restaurant , service, etc.  The app just makes it so easy to check with a tip of your finger.
Version 6.1 2012-06-11 3
So far the app is decent. Works just as well as searching the Internet. But the one thing I thought it would have, i can't find.  A way to share these places with people I see fit... Whether by email, facebook, etc.  I got the app so I could share places with my husband, via his tablet.  That doesn't seem to be working.  Disappointed.
Version 5.5 2011-05-08 5
Awesome pool of information. I use the app less as it has some missing features compared to the real website. But TA is the one website I always use prior to any travel plans and it always helps tremendously.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
Discovered this app while in Vermont for a wedding. Set up perfectly to get a general idea of cities and will even direct right to google maps for directions. I will use this every time I travel
Version 5.7 2011-08-25 5
I never book a hotel without looking it up on trip advisor. And the app is clean and super user friendly. I wish there were more options like searching for nightlife in travel destinations. Otherwise awesome app!
Version 5.9 2011-11-30 5
So easy to use and no major complaints on how it runs. I'm catching up on all my reviews from our travels this year, and I like using this app better than the actual website! Thank you!
Version 5.93 2012-03-03 5
I've been a TripAdvisor user for years. It is by far, the best site to help you choose: who, what, where, when. Can't live without this, from local restaurant choices to international travel. Haven't been led astray yet! Love it!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-04 5
Great way to get an overview of any place you're considering for a trip. And all the clutter from the website is gone; the app just shows you what you need. Love it.
Version 6.6 2013-01-27 5
Using it to read up on the places we will be going both before we booked for the reviews, and after booking for tips and tricks. Mobile access to the forums is also great.
Version 6.6 2013-01-27 5
I've discovered that a lot of phone apps don't compare to the full website in terms of functionality. That is not the case with Trip Advisor- it works just like the website.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-15 3
I've experienced a few facility location errors with Tripadvisor which have created confusion, and occasional disappointment. Selecting a facility based upon the reported location, and paying a price premium for the same reason is a formula for frustration (grinding of teeth; issuing mea culpas to traveling companions) and anger.
Version 5.7 2011-07-25 4
Not a bad interface and the options are pretty good. Would love for this app (and others) to get clearer signals for "how far in which direction" - whether driving or walking it is little helpful in an unfamiliar area to just get "distance" info. Good crosscheck on Yelp's database and vice-versa.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 4
This app would be excellent if I didn't require anything specific in my search.  As it is, I must look for rooms w/wheelchair access and roll-in showers.  Unfortunately I have to go outside this app to get that info.  But for a quick look at what people think it's great.
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 5
Very helpful app when traveling and love that people provide their personal feedback as well as being able to see feedback from my Facebook friends! Just great!
Version 5.7 2011-08-06 5
Found this accidentally , found an apartment / rental for 50$ a night in amsterdam ! 
I didn't see a way to share info via E-Mail though ..... 
All in all a great way to find hotels etc. , includes prices , pics and reviews , Love it !
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
Great app, awesome features for planning. I love the street view option. Fast, efficient, and fun. I wish they were all designed this way. Usually don't care to write reviews but this one is worth it.
Version 6.6 2012-12-11 5
Easy to use and full of useful information. I LOVE being able to read reviews quickly and easily when choosing a hotel. Will be my new go-to app when traveling.
Version 6.5 2013-03-22 3
It's a shame when the web site is actually better than the native app. I only give it three stars because TripAdvisor is such a great service to travelers. Formatting is optimized in the app for the iPad, which is nice, but I find myself hitting the web site to find B&Bs. Love the service, but for me the app was not a favorite.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 5
I find this app very helpful in making traveling choices, people who submit are very helpful and usually help me to make the right choices.
Version 6.0 2012-03-16 5
Trip Advisor is my most favorite place to search and plan for my travel. The reviews from members are accurate and very helpful. Thank you all of the reviewers for taking your time to write your reviews
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 3
Generally, this is a good app. Sometime, its hotel ratings are suspect. For example, a highly rated one in Clovis, CA, overlooks a junkyard! The Clovis Cole Best Western, rated poorly, has the best location in town yet is set back from any street noise by a large, shaded parking lot. Otherwise, I have had a good experience using this app.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-27 5
Easy to use, helps us to find great places to visit just about everywhere & has helped us to get out and discover our own great city! Definitely recommend getting it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 4
A great user friendly app. Quick and the location finder helps to make this a will thought out app. I love to follow the forums about where my next trip is and this makes it easy to waste time at work while I take a mini vacation. Keep up the good work!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-19 5
Really enjoy the "SAVE" feature...builds anticipation. Pictures from all over! Happy travels to all.
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
and am delighted with the app. So far no bugs, downloads quickly. Glad to have such easy access to the same helpful information while on the go.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 2
I really like the quality of reviews and pictures left by the users, but the organizational tools are not helpful at all when trying to plan a trip. There are no grouping options, no sequencing, and I'm having difficulty sorting anything other than in alphabetical order, which is very unhelpful if you have favorites saved from various areas of the world.
Version 5.93 2012-03-10 5
Use TripAdvisor for a few years and it is the best tool on the net and in advertising. The customer is the only person who really knows what is great service or poor quality. Thank you TripAdvisor for a great tool.
Version 6.6 2013-03-25 4
We got this app right before our last trip. We drove from Michigan to Denver to San Francisco to Fargo to back home. This app found great places to eat, sleep and see all along the way!!
I recommend  this app before going on any trip. Short or long!
Version 8.3 2013-12-23 5
Whenever and wherever you are, call upon Trip Advisor to guide your decisions.  From the beaches of the Bahamas to the mountains of the Alps, you owe it to yourself to open up this app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
Even when my desktop is available, I prefer to pull out the iPad and search on it. Map search lets me see what's nearby and where things are relative to my itinerary. Sometimes I can find a cheaper place a little further down the road.
Version 6.6 2013-03-07 5
I love Trip Advisor. The wealth of info alone would make it wonderful - but what a bonus to be able to review places you have been. I always consult Trip Advisor whenever we are planning a trip. It's great!!!!
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 5
This is a great tool when traveling in both scenarios - impromptu (so figuring out the place while there) and planning before the trip. It's been wonderfully helpful.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-06 5
We used this app extensively over the past 2 weeks on a 6000 mile round trip road trip and found it to be fairly accurate and very easy to use.  We started using the website first and then saw there was an app, YEAH!!
Version 5.8 2011-08-20 3
App would be great if it didn't crash as often. Can look for restaurants and hotels near you, so that's kind of neat. Does an automatic review translation which can sometimes be amusing instead of useful, because it doesn't get it right every time, but it's easy to switch off that feature. Hope the update will fix the crashing.
Version 5.92 2012-02-20 5
Just recently downloaded this app and haven't used it too much yet, but I like all the options and filters. It has multiple links for each location. So far I am really glad I have it on my phone.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 5
It's been great having this in my pocket. Have used it for finding hotels, getting travel tips , even just locating a restaurant near by. It's always a great tool to have in your pocket as a modern traveller.
Version 6.1 2012-07-25 5
I've been a fan of trip advisor for a while now, and this addition of the iPhone app is a logical step to improving their reach and services.

I always use trip advisor to check places, restaurants and hotels!
Version 5.9 2011-11-11 5
My fave app for choosing travel agendas or restaurants! It is so refreshing to give and get honest reviews  I only wish they had such an active board like this for doctors, dentists and other service providers. 
You rock TA!
Version 6.5 2012-09-20 5
Loved my stay and it was the second time at this beautiful resort. You walk in to the aroma of a clean room and the beds are so comfortable. Front desk staff are polite and helpful. Very highly recommended!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-27 5
It's great to use with our 3 days in Germany. Our use varies from finding hotels to recommended places to visit. Awesome. Thank you team who developed this apps
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 5
I travel a lot & always check Traveladvisor for recommendations. I like it because you get reviews from other travelers just like me. And usually quick & to the point.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 4
Love this site.  We refer to it for all of our travel. Only improvement I can see at the moment is that when a location is identified by the user, the associated map should have an icon identifying that location. I have had to back track to a paper map or google to find the town.
Version 6.0 2012-03-25 3
While this is still a great app, the recent 'upgrade' is really a downgrade.  On the old version, once you selected a restaurant, the ones you didn't choose would drop off the map and it would show how to get there.  Now the map retains all of the pins, so it's hard to figure out which one you are traveling to in areas with many options.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
I have tried to publish a review of the Ryan's restaurant here in Crossville, Tn. So far they haven't after four attempts. Too bad... Oh yeah, Ryan's is a filthy place to eat. I was sick for 3 days after my unfortunate dining adventure.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 3
When you select an attraction and click around to read reviews and view pictures and then go back to the full like it defaults back to the beginning of the list and you have to hit "next page" a several times to find the place you left off. Very annoying.
Version 5.8 2011-09-09 5
It is very accurate and easy to use.  I rely on it and have used it all over the world.  People are different and everyone has a bad day but I find the accuracy dead on the vast majority of the time.
Version 5.8 2011-09-09 5
I used this in Charleston on vacation, found several good resraurants, avoided some bad ones and made reservations on line.  Zagate came up empty for the same town, and Google maps was not as seemless to use.
Version 5.91 2012-01-15 5
The app works well. Let's you browse web sites without crashing, then takes you right back to your original list. Ranks attractions and provides many reviews.
Version 3.0 2009-10-05 1
We really like tripadvisor online but this app doesn't work w/my itouch even when attached to internet at home. I can't rate information it might provide since I don't get that far and it leaves me hanging at "...can't find my location try back later." This app really needs a way to input w/keypad a location, which would be a nice feature when traveling to be able to check ahead to where you are going to be at dinner hour to find a place to stop. I'll keep hoping but this doesn't do it yet.
Version 5.8 2011-08-29 5
The absolute best resource for planning a trip and getting to know the good and the bad in a certain city, the reviews are detailed and helpful, I highly reccomend Tripadvisor for anyone planning a trip anywhere.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
Whether you're traveling cross country or to a city an hour away, this app will fill you in in places off the beaten path, and things not to miss. I especially love it to find local restaurants that are popular.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-23 4
I have used this website many times over the years.   Only once did I feel the reviews were inaccurate.  On the whole I have received accurate, helpful information to help make my travel plans successful.
Version 5.7 2011-07-06 5
Very useful, like having a local helping you. Also you can plan your day by using the maps telling you where the places you are interested in are located. Great time saver app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-08 3

Version 8.4.1 2014-02-22 5
Use the app every day to read reviews for upcoming trip. Works flawlessly. Can save destinations, view photos, read the latest reviews. Great app. Permanent spot on my phone and Pad.
Version 5.5 2011-04-30 4
It is very easy to find even international flights. Takes away the hassle of visiting multiple web sites to find deals. Only problem is that it doesn't support multicity search. I wish there was a way to track my wishes and get alerts on fair changes.
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 5
Real reviews, real photos. You can actually find out about restaurants & hotels not just the skewed marketing scheme put forth by the establishment.
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 5
Real reviews, real photos. You can actually find out about restaurants & hotels not just the skewed marketing scheme put forth by the establishment.
Version 5.8 2011-10-28 5
I find this to be a stellar example of true time saving informative usefulness.  My best app so far. I like that it uses location gps and all the reviews are easy so it will only get better and better.
Version 5.9 2011-12-31 5
I've used this app several times at my destinations. I don't have time to look up restaurants, so I went to the restaurants with good reviews, always turned out very delightful. This app stands out when you are outside US.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 4
I love this app. It's great because it lets you use your current location. Perfect for those last minute trips and adventures. However, I'd like it a lot better if the map feature would open in my Maps application. That way getting directions would be faster.
Version 8.2 2013-12-01 5
Clearly I like Trip Advisor. The iPhone app has come in handy many times on my travels. Check out some of my reviews while your searching. Look for the name soulprojector
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
The only way to write up your own itinerary, book your hotels and feel confident that you don't get a lemon!  Best to read all the reviews.  This IS my favorite website along with their city guides...Love it. :). :)
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-18 5
I like to travel A Lot, and I have learned that I will Always have the best experience when traveling if I first check out the hotel/resort on TripAdvisor.
Version 5.4 2011-04-27 5
I use TripAdvisor regularly. I think it's one of the most useful apps available. It's quick & easy, making it a wonderful alternative to the regular site for quick info on the go.
Version 6.6 2012-11-21 5
Downloaded this app before heading on a trip to Florida. We have used it for everything, from finding our hotels, places to eat, and attractions to see!  It's been spot on each time!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-26 5
Trip adviser is an awesome app! Any vacation I'm about to plan I check Trip advisor first before booking. You get a lot of great info from other people who have experienced it first hand.
Version 6.2 2012-06-17 5
We have used Trip Advisor for well over a year and have found it to be very helpful.  Thanks to all the commenters who have steered us straight to so many excellent hotels and restaurants.
Version 6.3 2012-07-20 5
The best resource when traveling to unfamiliar destinations. User reviews are the best way to make plans. And you can find hidden treasures you'd never see otherwise, even in your own backyard.
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5
I've been using Trip Advisor for 5 years but just found the app for my Touch. It's easy to use and gives me the info I need quickly. Just used it in Philly to find a great little restaurant for dinner.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-01 3
The only thing I don't like about the most recent version is that I can no longer sort my Saves geographically.
Now, I can only sort alphabetically, by date or by rating. I preferred previous versions when I could sort everything by its location. 

I hope this option becomes available again.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-19 5
I am on the road constantly. I use this app almost every day from places to eat to places to stay. Wouldn't leave home without it. Now excuse me, I have to find a place for dinner!
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 5
Came across this app while on vacation and it has been the most useful app in finding unknown secrets on vacation. This app has been very helpful and won't leave home without it!
Version 6.6 2013-02-19 5
The trip advisor app was EXTREMELY useful for our honeymoon in Puerto Rico! We were unable to plan much ahead of time so the trip advisor app helped to guide us toward a great experience! Thank you so much! :D
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 5
This is one of the best apps for anyone wanting to travel to unfamiliar places. No matter where you want to go you will find detailed info for flights, accommodation, restaurants and places of interest
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
Working in Waikiki reviews are very important. And trip advisor is the biggest supporter!!! Must have if you travel or even if you just want to check on your hotel.
Version 8.3 2013-12-19 5
I am such a huge fan of TripAdvisor. I use it every time I go out of town. Always able find something to do, somewhere to stay and some place to eat. Never disappoints.
Version 8.3 2013-12-29 5
Superb app for the amazing and must have tripadvisor
From hotels, cities, restaurants
Should always check reviews to have an idea where you are going to and know real people opinions
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Have used trip advisor for years as a website which normally you can find te truth rather than marketing. This app is just as functional, a well written app.
Version 6.2 2012-06-18 5
Quick and easy to use. Reviews help make or confirm decisions. Also like the 'Near Me Now' feature that helps find restaurants, etc., in unfamiliar territory.
Version 5.4 2011-04-18 5
Even in the most rural of places when roaming the west, I find that trip advisor always comes through, giving me solid advice on lodging and dining. It has become one of my favorite apps!
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5
I use it all the time to stay up on hotels for my vacation spots. I have never had it crash or freeze works better then 90% of the apps out there. Love the reviews from actual customers along with pics.
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 5
I don't make any vacation plans without "consulting" my travel bible! I highly recommend this app as the reviews are from travelers and customers, and not the business owners!
Version 7.1.1 2013-11-03 4
Used it to research hotels for an upcoming trip to Singapore.  The app has a few features I didn't even see on the website.  I like the app UI and ease of use. However, the traveler submitted photos are slow to load and sometimes the app seems to lag.
Version 8.2 2013-12-10 5
This is a great app for planning a trip. If wanting to go somewhere definitely use this!! It is helped me find restaurants in cities I've never been and great deals on flights and hotels. Totally worth it to download
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-20 5
Searching for restaurants, attractions, places to stay, and so much more - Trip Advisor is a great tool to have in your phone. You can favorite things to visit them later too. Definitely get!
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
I love trip advisor because I am all about options, it gives me that. Sure you want to travel on x-dates but here's a few other prices should you be flexible and save a few bucks! Love it.
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 2
I will give a 5 stars as soon I will be able to share any hotel I find in this apps to my friends and I would like to be able to get phone #' fax # or email add this way I can reach someone at the hotel before booking and also I would like to be able to see the price as one of the first thing on the page. So I thing this update can be done and hopefully others people would like that too???
Sincerely Thierry.
Version 6.4 2012-08-18 5
I always chk tripadviser B4 traveling anywhere. It has people that tell u what they think of a place and people don't BS around good or bad!! I like that real people review not people working for them!!!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-26 5
I use trip advisor regularly and it is awesome help. I used to use Yelp, but it's hard to know what reviews are real and which are crafted by the business. 
Would definitely recommend.
Version 5.9 2011-11-22 3
Option to save attractions to a list was nice, but this list is kept separate from lists you create on the website. You can't do your research on the laptop & then access that list from the phone.  Can't zoom in on photos. Great reviews, but I expect more functionality in the app.
Version 5.8 2011-09-09 5
The best travel app I've ever used. The only drawback is that you need 3G or WiFi coverage to launch it which is a bit annoying especially when you are roaming. Apart from this, amazing!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-11 5
I'm a traveler from way back, whether on business or pleasure, I may not have time to squander. This app helps me select the best places to see and things to do when I'm out and about.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
I love this app! I find it very helpful to locate quality businesses to patronize when I'm out of town. Reading reviews definitely helps me make decisions, and I haven't been let down yet!
Version 5.8 2011-08-10 5
Shows location of hotels and restaurants,gives pricing, and very current reviews. the street view of hotels is nice, since you can see the area where you"ll be staying. like it a lot!!!
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 2
This was a great app. The latest revision does not respond to selections, which start out too small for large fingers.
The app now makes it very difficult to get going without first logging in through Facebook, and has difficulty accepting NO for an answer. I hope that the developers will work to restore this app to the high level of usefulness that it used to have.
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
Very good tool for all travelers, excellent to have access to real pictures taken by the people that lived different experiences and not only edited pictures from professional photographers.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-10 5
Just like its standard desktop version, this app brings me all the basic website travel info I need and uniquely local suggestions as well. Great app!
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 5
I always intend to go home and write up reviews, but life gets in the way. The app lets me do this in the spot- so it gets done! I've gotten so much value from Tripadvisor so I want to return the favor! This helps me do so.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-04 3
There is no way for contributors to check on their previous contributions or status level. Needs more functionality for that. Some reviews are totally off. Cross check, and always best to ask friends and not totally rely upon anonymous people who may have an axe to grind in some cases. Otherwise, fine.
Version 6.2 2014-01-03 5
Every time we are here the staff is so friendly and willing to do whatever it takes to make your stay enjoyable. Food and drinks never disappoint. Awesome beachfront!! New Years is a must here!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-31 5
A great site for finding new and exciting restaurants and reasonable and clean hotels. I love to read the reviews. You get a good sampling of experiences and can decide for yourself--try it or skip it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-23 5
No complaints...great Tripadvisor reviews all in an easy to use platform. New hotel price search is awesome too.

If you're a traveler and have an iPhone you should have this app
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 5
Easy to use and find places. The reviews are usually accurate but you should check other sources as well. 
I've found some excellent places, some good BUT one was very bad.
Version 6.1 2012-05-23 5
Love this ap and use it all the time when traveling to find good local places. Only complaint is that you have to open each review individually and can't expand them all at once.
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
I love that I can use this app not just for hotels and restaurants, but also for things to do. Everything is linked to the map, so it's very easy to find what I need.
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 2
I use this service to go to places that I've never been before. I actually don't listen to reviews of other people, as their taste are not mine. I'm 80 years old and have done it all... Conquered the world and enjoying just being able to experience our local fare. This really a great way for information, just ignore the reviews, including mine.
The dragon tamer
Version 8.3 2014-01-02 5
This is the most helpful app for any type of traveler. Instantly see hotel reviews and ratings, near-by attractions, and travel tips. I use it while planning and during my vacations!
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 2
I figure an app should give you a lot more than accessing the same website with a browser. This one doe not.

It's harder to sort your searches. I can't seem to find out how to mark a review as helpful. I can't seem to write a review and I can't access my Tripadvisor profile. The only enhancement I see is the "nearby" search, accessing my iPad's location, but that is just not enough.

Try again.
Version 6.4 2012-08-23 2
I find there are things I can't do on the app on my iPad 2 that I can do on the full website.  I'm not given the option to preview my review before I submit it.  I tried to review a restaurant that wasn't already on their list and it wouldn't allow me to add it.  When I tried the link from a review to the hotel website, I got a distorted page that doesn't work.  I will just go to the full site from now on.
Version 8.2 2013-12-04 5
My go to app for finding restaurants and cool hotels while traveling.  Usually right on the money.  Needs better category for nightlife, bars, beer/liquor stores tho, to help us craft beer hunters out there.

Do you travel at least once a year? Well, this app is a MUST.

Hotels, restaurants, atractions... Everything in one place and driven by users like you and me.

In my opinion the best app for travel ever. Don't leave home without it!
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 5
The app is fantastic. Easy navigation, easy way of finding the destination for review, overall nice app to have if you are always on the move and need to compare vicinities which to attend.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-26 2
I just stayed in the #1 Tripadvisor hotel in Key West. Ha ha ha.  It's an old smelly motor court style hotel on the wrong end of Duvall and I didn't book the Casa Maria Waldorf which I'd originally planned that was #20.  Ha ha ha.  Jokes on me.  The #2 hotel in Key West on Trip Advisor The Almond Tree Inn ha ha ha another old motor court inn with new decor in the rooms.   Nice for a motor court inn but #2 ha ha ha.  Click....Trip Advisor Deleted forever
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
Love TripAdvisor. Very happy with the iPad app so far. The app is rather insistent about getting a rating, so this five-star rating comes after limited use. That said, it's free and I very much appreciate the app.
Version 5.91 2012-01-14 5
I used this App to plan my vacation in Russia based only on useful advices from TA and everything was perfect. 
So much information and so easy to get it!  It's just like having your own travel agent.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 5
Great reviews written from real people.  I like to see things to do in cities before I visit them.  It also gives me insight into a hotel before I check in, like the gym or Internet costs.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 5
Trip advisor is an awesome tool to share with others experiences that you've had to allow others to see how a hotel, attraction, etc...is before they make their choice. So thank you for having this app!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
I use this everywhere we go including around home. It's very helpful and I love reading what others think and I like to leave my reviews also. Great app!
Version 5.91 2012-01-17 5
Love using Trip Advisor on my PC, but this app for iPhone and iPad has me writing even more reviews, as well as searching out recommendations constantly!  Easy to use and navigate - fantastic!
Version 6.3 2012-07-31 5
We used your service on a recent trip to Maine and found it most helpful. The reviews are fun,full of information and for the most part dead on target.  Good job!  Thanks for the service!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 4
If you use an ipad from a foreing country, you only have the forums from your own country....for example.. I use german tripadvisor and if I search for hawaii in the forums I only see answers from german travelers. Not helpful at all!
Version 5.9 2011-11-30 5
Trip advisor is like having a friend in the area, the travel business or food industry.
I heard that companies will review themselves, but on the whole, if you go with the consensus opinion, you will hit a home run.
Version 5.9 2011-12-17 5
Trip Advisor is always reliable.  Family of five, we can hit the road without thinking too far ahead and always rely on Trip Advisor for reviews & info on the things we need, right when we need them: <3!
Version 6.1 2012-07-09 5
This is the best app for making sure you spend your hard earned money at hotels and restaurants and other attractions that are worth your time. Always use it to go to the best places and avoid bad experiences.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-14 5
I've really been happy this software. It allowed for planning ahead, save to my profile and then all we had to do was look it up on my phone when we were out and about.
Version 5.7 2011-07-27 5
It has hotels and restaurant reviews that have saved me a lot of problems when traveling. Now the first thing 8 do is check it in my cell before I go anywhere. Good to have it in my iPhone now.
Version 5.8 2011-10-04 5
I love flipping through actual traveler reviews. I'm much more likely to listen to normal people like me as opposed to travel writers. Haven't really found any issues with it yet. Will keep looking :)
Version 5.8 2011-11-01 5
I have found Trip Advisor to be very useful. Access to data and reviews while traveling is important to where you most need them. I found it to be a valuable resource on a recent trip.
Version 6.4 2012-08-22 4
This is a good app and extremely helpful. It could do with a map feature and an online booking section.

You can't have it all but it is helpful to get reviews of places you want to go to and feel like a real critic as well

Go TripAdvisor
Thank you
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 3
Either it's hard to find or the ipad version doesn't have it, but I cannot figure out how search for restaurants near me - something I can do on my iphone.   That's a pretty serious omission!  
I like tripadvisor over yelp especially outside the US, but now it's a PITA to find a place to eat dinner if I'm not planning big time ahead ....
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5
As a frequent traveler I like to research the places I am going prior to my visit. Trip advisor allows me to see tips that have been successful with previous travelers! Wonderful app!!
Version 5.7 2011-08-05 5
Love that you can see restaurants and things to do in the area(s) with ratings and comments. Trip Advisor
Has saved me from wasting my money on several occasions and helped me find fantastic local spots and eateries too!
Version 5.9 2011-12-31 5
I seldom go anywhere without first checking Trip Advisor. I find the reviews honest and insightful, even if they are often conflicting. Everyone has their own point of view.
Version 5.4 2012-01-10 5
I always start with trip advisor- then branch out to my frommer's guide (for finds) and other websites (for deals). But tripadvisor is the best aggregator of info AND source of traveler reviews, tips and feedback EVER. Love. It.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-12 5
Tripadvisor has the best and most comprehensive travel site.  I use it for every single trip-- for every aspect-- hotel and restaurant reviews- and for tips on places to see. Love the ease of using it.
Version 5.1 2010-11-11 5
Every summer i travel to a diff place and need ideas to stay. I always look on the web for hotels but every hotel says there the best & has the best pic but this app has pic and reviews from real ppl rather good or bad. Just an awsome app!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-23 5
Use this app a lot when traveling. Like checking reviews before spending our hard earned dollars. Still use full site when at home but great for on the go.
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
This made my Paris trip much more enjoyable. The best are the city guides and the "point the way" compass. So helpful in a foreign land. I also love the traveler photos and reviews. I feel I can trust them more.
Version 8.1 2013-11-14 5
Love being able to pull up the restaurants near me when on a trip. My husband and I always try to hit restaurants in the top 5 wherever we go, and they almost never disappoint!
Version 5.9 2011-12-17 5
...never lets be down. By far the most reliable city guides I've ever used. In puerto Rico as I write this at a recommended restaurant and extremely satisfied. Thank you for making my traveling so efficient and guaranteed enjoyable!
Version 6.2 2012-06-26 5
I always check Trip Advisor to help me find good places to eat and to stay while traveling. So far, I have found some real gems and have not yet been disappointed.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
Can't go wrong with this one.... as any other app... you have to play with it... navigate around and it's simple to do. Very Informative! And I love it... as do the family and friends I've asked to try this app. Thank you
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 5
I rely heavily on the opinions and advice from other travelers. I find most people are like me and give honest and fair reviews. This is so helpful when traveling and looking for rooms, attractions and meals!
Version 6.1 2012-05-14 5
I hate being surprised when making hotel or restaurant choices. Travel advisor takes the guess work out of choosing. It helps me plan better and know what awaits me.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-18 5
Love the new TripAdvisor City Guides. Have been directing all my friends to the site. I travel quite a bit Internationally and this app allows you to find places even while offline. 

Thank you!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
Fast, stable and provides exactly the information you would want in an intuitive format.  Helpful for personal travel, finding a nearby restaurant, or planning activities when family comes in town.
Version 5.9 2011-11-23 5
This hotel is top of the line. Awesome hotel staff, fantastic food and beverage and all around first class hotel. Best that Indy has to offer. No other property comes close to the level of service I experienced here.
Version 6.2 2012-06-13 5
Came in handy in trying to find restaurants worth visiting while in the super expensive Ketchican, Alaska. Hate to spend a crap ton of money on food that's crap and this app helped me avoid the dining pitfalls.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 5
I love the app and site I use it everyone we travel and now just as much for local stuff . I love to write honest reviews. Helps make the places better i think who knows who cares
Version 8.3 2013-12-28 5
Beautifully constructed app with easy to use interface. Makes it easy to read reviews by others and write one's own review of a place.
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 5
Trip adviser is most helpful when planning a trip to either a new location or you simply want to stay at a different hotel in the same city. I always use it when planning a trip for hotels and new places to eat.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
So much information in one handy and cross-referenced app is super!  I'm using this on an ipad2 although i see others with smaller screens have asked for some alternate displays of information.  Still, great app!
Version 5.8 2011-10-20 5
We always use Trip Advisor before going anywhere.  Reviews from travelers are honest and they have no "axe to grind."  Thanks so much for making our journeys that much more enjoyable!
Version 8.2 2013-12-19 5
My uses are primarily for restaurants & attractions, paying attention to reviews written n recent months. Reviews from veteran travelers and review writers are very helpful.
Version 5.7 2011-11-17 5
We've used this app mostly for European travel, and it's a winner. The reviews by other travelers helped us narrow down the field of possible hotel rooms, and now we've written reviews from our trips.
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
Excellent app to plan trips and get into great hotels for reasonable prices. This also helps you get your airplane tickets as well. Also the hotel reviews on this website are really helpful.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
Excellent app. Use it all the time and find very useful. Better than yelp, where or city search. Only issues are that it doesn't have restaurant opening/shut times and it doesn't display menu's.
Version 6.3 2012-07-16 5
Visiting Gettysburg was great.  The battlefield was excellent, visiting the Eisenhower farm was very good and the other historic buildings were excellent too.  Jennie Wade house is a must see.
Version 6.6 2013-04-06 5
Have used Trip Advisor on all my trips since downloading the app. I enjoy reading the reviews and adding my own. Cuts down on the trial and era of finding a good place to eat or stay.
Version 5.5 2011-05-02 5
We just used this app for the first time on a trip to Maui. The only word that comes to mind is invaluable. It truly is like using a Swiss Army Knife. It does it all... it uses your current location to point out restaurants, activities, etc. Awesome.
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5
I have used TA online for years. Just downloaded the app and have been planning my trip to Myrtle Beach. Real customer reviews make TA a valuable resource. I would not take a trip without using TA first.
Version 5.92 2012-02-21 5
Anytime I travel I always check TripAdvisor first. I get the most useful information in a great format. I love the rating system. You can check the rest but start with the best.
Version 6.6 2013-03-03 5
Trip advisor takes the pain out of some bad choices made spontaneously. Read the reviews first.  Perfect ap.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
I have found that the information that seems to be true for the most part helps in deciding where to eat or stay. Great place to start looking for what you need to know
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 5
Used this app to find a hotel where I was located. Showed me a list & prices. Booked it 10 min before I arrived & saved money! Very handy app to have. Also loved the ratings on every location.
Version 6.6 2013-02-26 5
We use it on the road as well as locally when trying a new restaurant!  Don't waste hard earned money on a bad experience!  Just see what others said before you splurge!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
I used this to make a reservation on my iPad but then could find no good way to save my reservation confirmation from within the app. I had to snap two screen shots and piece them back together in Pages to have something to print and email.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Not knowing much about a city is not an issue using Tip Advisor. The map, ranked attractions and comments have already been a great benefit. I'd recommend using this app -- especially for vacation destinations.
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 4
I love this app but my only issue is that everytime i try to do something it says "location services unavailable" Location services are unavailable. please make sure they are enabled and try again" but i dont know how to fix this. other then that this is a must have app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 5
This has got to be one of the best apps available for someone looking for a hotel and I haven't even tried using the other features for restaurants, etc.  I highly recommend it for anyone.
Version 6.2 2012-07-08 5
I used to use Yelp: however I deleted that shortly after using Trip Advisor.  

Reviews are much more dependable.  Dependability is very important as I travel a great deal.  

Get it, you won't be disappointed.
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 5
Very helpful sometimes you may need to take some reviews with a grain of salt. But nice to look at to plan a trip. Wish I would of had it when we book out last hotel.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
If in mood for some very fine Cuban food -$
& great ambiance , visit El Ambia's on Melbourne Ave in Melbourne Fl. Billy makes the best mojitos.   Excellent pork and really nice Cuban music featuring the owner singing on weekends.
Version 6.6 2013-03-03 3
Significantly less functionality than website. Worst part is when you try to narrow a search within a location, e.g. search for "brunch" in Shanghai, and then the search is again for the entire world. 

Also irritating is the fact that lists go back to start at #1 after starring/saving an item.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-21 5
I downloaded this app on our recent vacation to Kona, Hawaii.  It helped us find the best beaches and things to do.  Helped us locate the things others had told us to see.  It's is a great app.  I recommend it.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-25 3
Went to all the trouble to write a lengthy review, just to have it request a log in (I WAS logged in) and then it lost the whole review when I clicked ok to check the login. Also, please put ranking numbers on the map so you can tell what you are looking at, instead of just a field of various green dots. Thx.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
Great compliment to the website, always use tripadvisor before deciding on a hotel. The app is great for reviews, however, the photo usability can be a bit of a pain.
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-08 4
They really need to improve the search capabilities. It just isn't intuitive. If I want to find restaurants in a certain city it takes some some doing. I am sure it will just keep getting better though. The 'near me now' works great!
Version 3.0 2011-06-24 5
Just enter in your location & choose the hotel you're interested in and then pick a site (priceline, orbitz, etc) and it gives you the best rates! Easy to view everything and especially helpful in a pinch!
Version 5.7 2011-08-01 5
I REALLY go ALL OUT on our Vacations, Because of this app I was able to select a Beautiful resort and great Beach and Many great places to eat. I sent this app to all 3 of our daughters and to several friends!! Really a great app!
Version 5.92 2012-02-11 5
This apt is great with little effort I put in the dates I wanted to fly and I had several options cheaper than what I had trying several times going to many other sites and it was very easy to use I wish I had found it sooner.
Version 6.6 2013-02-11 5
I use TripAdvisor every time I travel.  Now that I have the app, I can use the "near me now" feature to find restaurants in the area.  NEVER misfire on a restaurant again!  This is my Top App, hands down.
Version 5.8 2011-09-25 4
Great planning vacation but I wish it will give you an option or recommend other areas not in the immediate vicinity!  For instance, I was researching places to eat in Farjio, Puerto Rico.  I wish there is a recommendation button for surrounding like old San Juan to eat
Version 5.9 2011-11-11 5

Version 8.2 2013-12-15 3
Struggle with the iPod and iPad apps includes the flashing of the screen anytime I type or enter a command(iPad) and when trying to book a hotel it won't move beyond the check-in and check-out dates(iPhone). Perhaps bc they're booked solid. But I don't think so. Just some minor improvements needed.
Version 6.3 2012-08-24 5
The very first time I'll go out of my way to rate an app! This app saves me money and time. Traveling to the US for the first time and I have used the app to plan my trip all the way. Thanks for such a great app.
Version 5.5 2011-05-02 3
I generally rely on Trip Advisor as a great resource to kick off a trip.  It was wonderful in Italy finding lodging and out of the way, excellent restaurants.  I would recommend. My issue is w the iPhone app. I can't seem to find a way to build a trip or save favorites. If it is there, obviously not intuitive. Please fix it soon. I am planning a trip to Spain and need it.
Version 6.0 2012-04-01 3
The app keeps forgetting my searched list. When I choose a hotel off the list and then I want to go back to the list, I find that it's disappeared I have to go back to the main menu to search for the list again. Otherwise, its been very helpful in planning a 6 week long trip through Europe :)
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 5
Very useful website!! Must to have access if ur traveling abroad. Do's and don't from fellow travellers is very useful. You can advise others as well in order to help others :)
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 5
And I like to get my rooms last minute.
Often Ill cruise by and see how it all looks from checking TA's app, then I call and get the best last minute rate, or drop in and talk to the front desk personally. Trip Advisor is great!
Version 6.1 2012-05-15 5
It's nice to know I can rely on regular people with honest reviews to help shape my trips.  I don't travel very often, but when I do it's usually to a place I've never been and Trip Advisor has yet to let me down!
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
Simple but powerful way to check new things out when traveling and to leave reviews for other people to check out.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-23 5
A small restaurant in downtown Kissimmee Fl serves some of the best food I have eaten in years. Be sure to try the Pesto Chicken Pasta and the Salmon salad. Prices are very reasonable.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
Our two families had such a blast sightseeing in Austin on our Segways with our awesome guide, Brian! He was so fun, informative and really cared about our safety. 5 stars for Brian, Austin and Nation Tours!
Version 2.0 2008-08-18 4
I use TripAdvisor quite a bit and I trust the reviews and opinions of TA's users, so I was excited to see this app. Pros: Works well, does exactly what is described and it's free! But I'd like to be able to filter by type of food and sort (by distance or rating). Overall it's simple and it works!
Version 6.6 2012-11-10 3
I am a huge Trip Advisor fan, but I'm disappointed with this app.  I often find I have to go to the traditional website to get accurate results.  The app may only show one  result when the same query in the traditional site shows many.  The mobile app map is glitchy. I hope the developer keeps working on it.
Version 6.6 2013-04-17 5

Version 5.7 2011-08-05 5
We found this app on honeymoon and it has made the trip so much better.  Now instead of guessing about a restaurant or a tour we can just search it!!!  Hopefully it will saves time and money!
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
I never take a trip without consulting TripAdvisor. And I've always found the reviews helpful. I've discovered many gems I wouldn't have visited if I hadn't used this app.
Version 6.6 2013-03-05 5
If you live to travel and love spontaneity, download this app.  It covers all things you need when exploring the familiar to the new.  Simple to use and comprehensive too.  Get it!
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-09 5
I love Trip Advisor!!!! We have found some of the best restaurants using this app! We use Trip Advisor everytime we go on vacation! It's very helpful in finding the best places to stay, and the best attractions in the area!!!
Version 6.6 2012-11-03 5
I use TRIPADVISOR for several years already.  Extremely helpful!  Chose hotels on Maldives, UK, Italy, Russia, Latvia - always 100% right.  Definitely recommend!  iPad and iPhone applications are really great!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-13 5
I'm planning our family's vacation already and this app is making it effortless!  Would love to see walking tours added, where feasible.  :)
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 4
Very useful for locations which are new to you. App would be better if it offered an opportunity to add restaurants or other places of interest. The app only allows comments on places currently in the app.
Version 6.6 2012-12-12 5
I love this app and I love trip advisor! I always check with them when traveling and have never been steered wrong. Use this app or suffer bad travel experiences!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-15 5
This app has never let me down. Power to the people. And seeing what my friends review is really nice. Want to find out what's around you that is worth seeing/eating/sleeping/doing, this app is for you.
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 4
Hi - this is my first time using Trip Advisor and so far so great!  I love the categories and I'm on line checking things to do in the next few cities we're visiting.  My husband and I, that is.  Will be back with more of a report after we've done what you suggest!  Thanks,  Phyllis & Reuben
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
This app is very good, no kidding. It helps plan trips any where in the world, tells you where and what to see, highlights and grads hotels for you at a glance including there prices what more can you ask for?  A crystal ball? Personally I like this app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-18 5
I love having trip advisor on my iPhone. It's like having a travel agent with me at all times. I've found the restaurant ratings to be consistently spot on! Great way to decide where to eat.
Version 5.92 2012-01-31 5
I'm planning a trip in October to Baltimore, MD and Washington, DC and am finding all kinds of information to have a wonderful vacation at my fingertips with this application.  It is an awesome program.  Thank you!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 4
Looking up information with this app is great. Where TripAdvisor could provide more is in the relatively limited input for adding a review compared to what is available on the full site.
Version 6.6 2013-03-06 5
It is a great app where you can express how you feel about hotels restaurants and touristy thing! You can also get suggestions for good places or if you have been to a place writw a &$&@ing review!
Version 5.4 2011-04-25 5
amazing app for the less traveled like me. a truly must have app when you are going to places you've never been before. this app will put fodor and zagat out of business someday.
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 4
Excellent app. Would be nice to have the option of an off line version. Also, would like to have better, more complete descriptions of the places to visit, rather than having to rely on reading the review.  But overall, one of the best travel apps I've found.
Version 6.2 2012-06-16 5
Tripadvisor has helped us find some really great hotels, restaurants, and things to do just about everywhere.

It also let's us rate places so that other people can enjoy them, or avoid them.
Version 6.2 2012-07-12 4
I wish I could see my profile via the app like on the website. Also wish the app asked all the questions an online review asks, but I LOVE having quick access to so much info when traveling!
Version 6.6 2013-03-14 5
I started using this since last week for a new trip to SFO and Grand Canyon and this provided tons of information with real user forums. A must to have app if you are travelling.
Version 6.1 2012-05-14 5
Great way to benefit from and also contribute towards letting others benefit from your travel experiences. I never plan a trip without trolling through TA. Rgds, Shirish.
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 5
This is something you just need. Treat it like Olympic ice skating. Throw outthe high & the low. Even if you really "know" a chain, you may be surprised. I'm  TA and this is one of my go to apps
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 5
I like how it makes recommendations on where you are (or where you choose). Much more interactive and user friendly than the web-site.  A great traveling companion!
Version 5.8 2011-12-24 3
It's fine half the time and the other times it crashes after you wrote a huge review and get ready to post it only to be kicked out and end up losing all info to the pt you don't want to write it again. Plus you can only write reviews on things that they list. You can't add new sites, places, or things on your own.
Version 6.2 2012-06-18 4
I always turn first to Trip Advisor for information when traveling or planning travel. I tell everyone about it. My only concern is that I find it a little difficult to explain to new users how to get into the Cruise Critic Roll Call and join a board
Version 6.6 2012-11-22 5
This app is making y trip planning much easier than I expected. It allows me to find my hotel, see what sites and restaurants are near and everything comes with photos and ratings.
Version 6.6 2013-04-13 5
I always check TripAdvisor for honest ratings and pics by fellow travelers before I book a hotel reservation or pick a restaurant. It's never steered me wrong. Thanks!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-20 4
I love Trip Advisor, but come on--I use my iPad in Landscape mode all the time. It took about 20 minutes to finally find out that the Save feature is only available in Portrait mode. Really?  How cumbersome. Please fix this!
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Traveling somewhere my family and I have never been... I've been utilizing trip advisor, and it's helped me find things to do, places to see, I would have otherwise passed over.
Version 6.4 2012-08-06 4
Two days in and it's still Really fun! We're headed for three countries we've never visited before and I am Very confident because of what I've been able to look up on this App.
Also by how Easy it is to find out how much in US$. Great links to hotel booking sites!
Version 6.6 2012-11-18 5
Really pleased with all the information and functionality available via this app, and it is very easy to use. 5 stars all the way!
Version 8.5 2014-03-03 5
I love tripadvisor! It is one of the best reference for traveling. I use it all the time when I'm planning my trip to find cheap air fair or hotels or b&b. I wish they will add train, subway or bus info soon.
Version 6.1 2012-06-14 5
Intuitive, easy to use, and packed with helpful information, tips and reviews from people all over the world.  Best travel planning tool I've found.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-14 5
I wish I had this app before my last vacation! I love it! The best way to get real reviews/pics from people who visited! Works perfectly without any issues on my 5c iOS 7.0.2
Version 5.7 2011-12-28 3
I'm finding it hard to move around this app...going from reading reviews for one hotel to writing one for another involves way too many moves... The search box should be on every screen. when I touched "submit", for example, it took me to a page from which there was no escape.  Now I'm caught in a loop!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 4
We have benefitted greatly in our travels from the reviews on Trip Advisor. We have tried restaurants & engaged in local activities we would not have known about, if not for consulting Trip Advisor. Keep up the good work & updates!!!!
Version 8.2 2013-12-01 5
Every time I go on vacation I live off this app. I use trip advisor online to book trips but use the app to find restaurants and activities. Has not failed me its awesome.
Version 5.4 2011-04-20 5
What a great little app. I like using this app for out of town business, of course, but this is also great for some in town travel when I'm just trying to find a different place to eat around me. It's cool!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 4
Little quirky. At times doesn't easily give you the business's phone number every time. You have to go to their website. However they do a good job listing everything and most reviews I've gone off of were spot on.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
Makes it easy to find nearby options when plans change. Good up to date information. Great for world travelers! Highly recommended!
Version 5.92 2012-01-29 5
The app is even easier to navigate than the website and links you straight to maps and directions.  Indispensable for restaurant hunting while traveling.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
I use several local user review apps for local restaurants but the true source for travel I always use Trip Advisor. I have used it for years and have found truly awesome hotels to stay at.
Version 6.2 2012-07-13 5
Love being able to check reviews before visiting. We're able to prioritize restaurants and attractions and get great tips for timing, pricing, etc.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
A must for traveling. Also, the more people who use it... The better it will get! I think there should be an option for quieter areas to go to, since most places are very touristy and crowded.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-09 3
The idea of this app is great and I love using it. But, still there is some improvement required. 
Especially, when writing reviews the app is not compatible with iPhone 4/5 and iOS 6.x. I. e. when writing a long review it is not possible to scroll/review the written text. Uploading pics fails sometimes.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-06 5
I use this app for hotels, restaurants and transportation wherever I travel.  Love the map and location functions that show me what's around.  Good, no nonsense reviews from travelers of all kinds.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 5
Used it both while booking my last two trips and while on them. An absolute must if you want ready reference while out and about in a foreign city!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-16 4
I use this quite often when I travel and bounce back on it and Yelp. But I wish this offered more options on nightlife - both bars and clubs. I'm 21 and love traveling, and having more nightlife options would be great.
Version 5.93 2012-03-01 2
I had several things saved for my Caribbean trip and it was all good until there was no wifi.  No wifi means everything saved was not accesible.  In other words, it was useless while on the trip.  What good is that?!

Needs an offline feature or the ability to export saved info to notes or whatever.

Luckily the iPhone 4S allows me to capture screen shots - there has to be a better way?!
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
I am always dubious of recommendations from random people who may not know much more than I do, but the combo of social input plus location is nice. Cannot see using it for researching locations like I would the browser version, but it is slick.
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 5
There's a reason this app is so well-rated.  It's global in reach and there's rarely "flaming" for unrealistic expectations.  I use it all the time for travel in the US or other areas of the globe.  It's truly a GREAT app.
Version 6.2 2012-06-26 2
This app is so frustrating to use that we quit and went back to the website. It never knows where you are (searching locally, when it fails, shows you a map of the earth? Gee, thanks!), it's sluggish as heck, and the filters only work when you select them twice.

Sloppy engineering, poor design and a missed opportunity for a good brand that depends on mobile users.
Version 8.5 2014-03-23 4
We use this anytime we are going out whether at home or on vacation. Only suggestion (not a complaint) would be to allow individual ratings for price atmosphere and service on the app like the main webpage.
Version 6.1 2012-05-31 5
Trip Advisor is my guru - my compass - my guardian - always guiding me in the right direction . A beacon of light in a dark sea . Without it I would be lost . I love you TA- more than my husband - who always gets us lost !!
Version 5.5 2011-05-11 5
I have been using this app to plan my trip to the uk, it has made it so much easier. Using it on my iPad is better than the web interface, I like being able to scroll the map.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
I use this all of the time. The ratings are generally accurate and always informative. Many know of Trip Advisor so I'll just rate the app. Easy to use, informative, and everything I would expect.
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 2
Hate that it is only landscape; want to view in portrait where more can fit on screen. Not intuitive finder. Can type names in of businesses (hotels, restaurants, etc) and it still can't find it. The web version finds them, even if you spell it incorrectly!!

This app version is only useful for "near me now" and even then its still limited and frustrating to use n
Version 5.6 2011-05-26 5
Using this app to plan my upcoming vacation and it has been very helpful. Lots of useful free information and I love that I can check out extra pictures of the places I want to visit. Overall a great app.
Version 5.92 2012-02-09 5
The best tool on the web for me. There is something about people sharing with other people and learning from people's mistakes and their "special finds"
Version 5.9 2011-11-23 4
I really liked the app; my only problem was that it kept sending me back to my current location and offered no simple way to bookmark, and not even MRU list. While that might be great for on-the-spot use, it's not great for planning.
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 4
The only flaw w/the iPad app is that even though I'm logged in to my tripadvisor account, when I go to my pc I can't see my Saves, the reside only on iPad.  Otherwise a great travel planning tool Great breadth of locations and excellent sorting tools.
Version 3.0 2009-07-07 5
CAN change location manually, not sure why everyone's complaining about that. Great FREE app, found numerous tastey food places I did't even know existed! You can even rate places and add new ones! Recomended!
Version 5.5 2011-05-07 4
This app is especially useful as an early stage trip planner, much like we used to use travel media and agent. With a few key strokes you can get some very good ideas and details about where you'd like to go and see.
Version 6.2 2012-06-26 5
I use this app, often, on my way back from a vacation/road trip, while my husband drives us back home.
I also rely on TripAdvisor for reviews prior to booking.
Version 8.2 2013-12-13 3
Have used as primary resource for Hotel info. But, since the app was updated; it's a little frustrating navigating the app. After you access the pictures or look at reviews, then the toolbar which has the map, call, save & email fields are not accessible. Frustrating!
Version 5.7 2011-06-27 4
This is a great app for planning trips. The maps allows you to always relate to your surrounding area from where you might consider staying,and places you want to go. The reviews very helpful,and all the information you might need for that fabulous vacation!
Version 5.9 2011-12-13 5
This app is awesome and gives you great information on all locations you might be searching for and has numerous photos from guests and reviews so you get a real feel of the property!
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 4
The app is good to find information about hotels, things to do, and restaurants. In this app you can also see photos from travelers and experience fist hand how things (hotel's rooms, lobby, outdoors) really are. I totally recommend it.
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
wanted to check out restaurants on our trip.  it was great to download Tripadvisors and have a listing of all of the restaurants on the island and having them rating.  Wonderful App.
Version 5.91 2012-01-16 5
I didn't think an app could be this helpful. We've been trying to plan a trip for spring break and wished we new about this app sooner. It saves a lot of time & is very user friendly.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-03 5
Great app, useful reviews and tips. Has been a boon to my travel planning since I've heard about. Have used it quite a bit on my pc and find this mobile app very useful.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
I had thought it would take hours to plan our weekend DC trip and find just the right place but with TripAdvisor I'm done in 20 minutes and have the rest of the morning to play!
Version 8.3 2013-12-28 3

Version 5.9 2011-11-08 5
I have found some great places to eat and stay through trip advisor. Love to read the comments from others! Love how it ranks the various establishments!
Version 5.9 2011-12-07 5
This is so helpful and came in handy. 
I was on a family vacation in palm springs and I lived about an hour away. I thought I knew my way around.... Well this app showed me I didn't know anything. 

Thanks for an awesome app.
Version 5.92 2012-02-21 5
Per my subject, this app is very minimalist which makes it quick and very easy to use. More importantly, has competitive prices.
Version 5.92 2012-03-09 5
This app rules my world - I travel A LOT, and I'll never book a room without checking with Tripadvisor first. I'm never misled, reviews are spot-on, and I'm a happy traveler thanks to this app. Rock on, TA!
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 5
Easy to use. Fantastic tool to use on spur of the moment trips. Makes finding dinner anywhere a breeze. I'll never leave for the weekend without it again. Unless i'm camping.
Version 6.6 2013-03-16 5
Great app so far. Very user-friendly. Love the option to "save" places to go to. Overall - terrific! Only thing I wish is that I could "favorite" form threads. That would make this app absolutely amazing.
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 5
Great app, works great for all my travels for both business and personal. If I want to take a customer out for lunch or dinner I know exactly where to go, and know that it will be great.
Version 8.3 2013-12-19 5
It's a great way to find a new food place even if you have lived there forever, I guarantee this app will find something new for you to try or see. 
I like that you can post photos.
Version 8.3 2013-12-30 5
I use this app almost every day no matter where I am. I always like to try all of the local restaurants, so I'm almost never repeating a location very often and this app comes in handy
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-08 5
This app is a must-have when on the road.  You can quickly find the best of what's nearby -- food, hotels, attractions -- and read user reviews, too!
Version 5.8 2011-08-14 5
I've always used the website and finally downloaded the app. I found the app easier to use than the website and its results were more exact for I was looking for.
Version 6.1 2012-06-10 5
I love to travel and I love the fair and honest reviews I get from trip advisor travelers.  Other sites(yelp) are just full of themselves and fuller of negative self serving reviews.  This really is the best one for my needs.  Thanks T.A.  Due Travelers
Version 8.2 2013-12-01 5
I count on it for everything from food to hotels.  Right now working with Trip Advisor on a stop at Vicksburg.  Love this app and trust the people who rate they're experiences.
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
User-friendly, great access to reviews, partner booking sites within app (with option to open in safari) and easy way to save your favorite hotels. Excellent iPad integration
Version 6.3 2012-08-02 5
When vacationing without a rental car, this app is our lifeline. It lets us know what is closest to us and the reviews and pictures help us to narrow done choices.
Version 6.6 2013-03-21 5
I use this whenever I am thinking about taking a vacation, so I know what fun things I can do, what great restaurants I can discover, and where I can rest at night! Perfect!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-27 5
I love Trip Advisor on Facebook. When they came up with this app I got it immediately. It is great to get ratings for everything needed in my travels. I haven't been disappointed yet, since using this app.
Version 5.8 2011-08-27 5
There are only a few apps on my Ipad, the ones that are really usefull! And TripAdvisor is one of them. Its trully helpfull and user friendly, fast and practical. If you love to travel as I do this is it, you wont regret it!
Version 6.0 2012-03-13 4
Finally trip advisor updated the iPad app to take advantage of the bigger screen than on the iPhone. 
The app is also much more intuitive to use than the old one. I now will use TA only via the app, no longer through safari.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 3
This app is useful, but not as functional as it could be. I find it's setup for navigating forums counterintuitive - the forums are one of the best tools tripadvisor has!
If you travel a lot, its worth having this app, but i hope they continue to work to make it better and more easily navigatable!
Version 5.6 2011-06-08 5
So far it seems to be a great app! Test will be when I actually her to go on a trip trusting this app. I am not a snob in general, but am a hotel snob, so I shall see. Ratings seem to match that of AAA to which I trust for the most part.  So for now I have to go with 5 stars.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 4
The TA app is very helpful to scout out spots for meals and to find places to visit. The iPad version is a little clunkier than the PC version but it is sufficient. There is a wealth of information from fellow travelers. There needs to be an easy home page non-FB sign-in area.
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
Our family took our first road trip this summer and found the app very useful in finding good places to say but more importantly for us good local places to eat. Good job creators!
Version 5.9 2011-12-06 5
this app makes me want to go explore every nook and cranny near me, near you and everywhere in between! A must for anyone who gets out and loves to really know what life has to offer....swn
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5
Using this app for this first time during our Smoky Mountain trip.  From finding a hotel to using the reviews for the attractions, it's making planning this trip more successful.
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
I'm currently living in Germany and me and my family are always in the go. This app helps me to get around recommending places to go and restaurants to eat. It goes with me everywhere! :)
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-22 5
If you're a traveler who wants to get special offers with great prices, you'll love this app. I've downloaded it and five minutes later, I'm booking my flight tickets :)
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 4
I use tripadvisor on the web frequently and the app just makes it that much more convenient. There's room for improvement with regard to searches, filtering and navigation but not so much as to dissuade me from using or recommending the app.
Version 6.6 2013-04-12 5
Perfectly points a traveler in the right direction.  Locating nearby providers and sorting by rating takes the guesswork out of travel decisions. 
Get this app!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-31 5
Very useful app if you travel a lot in some unknown places. Not always agreeing with notes and comments but at least gives a good indication on "should I enter or should I run?"
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 3
Hello!

I love the redesign. However the first two things I wanted to do are impossible with the app.  Those things are:

1. Change my screen name. 
2. View reviews I've written. 

Neither of those options are available. In fact, the only option under "account info", is to sign out.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-26 5
Before we travel, which we do a lot, I always check TripAdvisor! Whether it's help with a hotel, a restaurant, or just local attractions. It always proves helpful. I've not been disappointed!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-17 5
I travel a lot and this app has helped me get the best quality experience on all my trips. I recommend this to everyone that travels the US and overseas. Overall excellent!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-02 5
I have used trip advisor for years on my desktop computer and now I have it on my iPhone & iPad!  This app has made the difference between an average vacation and an Awesome vacation. It's a simply a must have.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-12 5
This app is fabulous! Not only is it extremely helpful for trip planning - but you can take a "virtual vacation" by viewing the beautiful photos others have uploaded.
Version 8.2 2013-12-17 5
I use this app a lot to write reviews, they need to have the option to add pictures from your mobile device. Other than that it's very reliable!
Version 5.8 2011-09-03 5
Loaded this on my iPad 2 for my upcoming trip 2 Portugal. It's like having hundreds of travel guides all rolled into one. Handy, helpful and weighs nothing. What more could a traveler ask for?
Version 5.9 2012-01-10 5
So far this is the best I've found. Its like the yelp of traveling apps. Great for young travelers on a budget too. Easy to use and very useful with "near me" search functions. Thanks for making it!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 5
The user interface is very, well, user friendly. Great to be able to access reviews quickly and easily from my phone. :)
Version 8.5 2014-02-24 5
When trying to figure out what I wanted to do while house sitting, trip advisor pointed me in the right direction to interesting things to in an unfamiliar area, two thumbs up.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Whether you are planning a day trip or a two week vacation this app is a must have. It has helped me create two great vacations for my family.
Version 6.1 2012-04-04 5
I have been using TRIP ADVISOR for both my domestic (North America) and foreign (mostly Europe) travel for over two years now. It is of great assistance for most of my lodging and restaurant selections.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 4
Between Yelp and TripAdvisor you can't go wrong. You'll likely need help when visiting a new area. If you want the opinions of the paying customers then look here before you go.
Filter out the extremes and decide for yourself.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-07 5
Please add the option of emailing listings and reviews.  Also the downloading of pictures when you are doing a review could be more user friendly.
Version 5.6 2011-08-09 5
I love this app. I even use it where I live, not just on places I travel. I have found many goo restaurants and hotels from this app that I did not know existed. I recommend it highly.
Version 5.8 2011-10-15 5
Love this app. I am new to the iPhone and this was really easy-to-use couldn't ask for anything better. I'm a big fan of trip adviser and use it all the time on my regular computer too. Nice to have it on the go.
Version 5.9 2011-11-15 1
Flight planning does not work at all. I select two airports, dates - and it gives empty page instead of results, plus "Refine Search" controls that do Nothing. No matter what airports or what dates I pick. 
List of restaurants is... incomplete. It will show you a chain restaurant 5 miles away, but fails to show an identical place next door from your location.
I do not see any reason to use this app. I'd rather run a Google search with better chances of success.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 2
Sometimes useful but mostly frustrating with it always asking you to sign in via Facebook every time you enter app. And, bad luck if you accidentally tap 'yes' and enter Facebook sign in on iPad. There is no escape. 

Even though on iPad, the main site is still a better option. As the functionality and accuracy of the app are both weak.

Do yourself a favour. Avoid!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Great app for travel and even finding interesting things in your area. I use it all the time to find a nice place to eat or something to do either in the states or in Canada. Lots of user reviews and even pictures
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-13 5
Recently took a trip from PA to FL and back.  Trip Advisor provides many credible suggestions for you need and very much helps to point you in the right direction
Version 8.2 2014-03-10 5
It's a good apps for checking hotel's reviews, common tourist areas. The reviews are credible and up to date. It's a handbook for planning my travel.
Version 8.5 2014-03-15 5
This is an amazing app. I have used it in the US as well as in Europe. I have been extremely pleased with the results and have found places that I otherwise would not have found.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-11 5
Trip Advisor is my go to place for things to see and do when I travel. The app is easy to get in and out of and get the info that I need quickly.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 1
The forum section of this app is appalling.  You can't save posts, follow posts, see any information about the person who posted (like if they are a destination expert etc). 
The search seems to be missing TONS of information!! So many hotels, activities, etc SHOW UP ON WEBSITE BUT NOT ON APP.
Also, you can't access your profile for messages or saved posts/information etc...
I have the app and I use the website instead...
Version 5.6 2011-06-08 5
I usually use trip advisor web site when planning a vacation or trip.  The iPhone ap is great and with the map you can locate hotel or place to eat in seconds.  It's a must for your iPhone and it's free.
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
We travel over 100,000 air miles a year and find this app a critical part of trip planning. I recommend using trip advisor for anyone. Make sure to use both American and foreign reviews.
Version 6.4 2012-08-20 5
What makes tripadvisor the best is he community of reviewers. App isn't as friendly as the website but you just can't beat the info here for planning an awesome vacation.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 5
We do not step foot into a hotel without
checking trip advisor! 
It has never let us down, always fine the best hotels!
Great when traveling to show you all the good things to see/do in area.
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
We have planned our entire Gatlinburg vacation with tripadvisor without a single missed step the entire vacation :)
Version 6.2 2012-07-26 5
I am a big Trip advisor fan but was skeptical about the app until I tried it. Very handy when you are on your trip, need info., and cannot get to your computer. I have used it in Vegas and in Estes Park.
Version 6.6 2013-03-06 5
This is my most frequently used app while I'm traveling. Some our favorite restaurants came from this app. It's a must have...
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 5
I loaded this on my iPad while traveling in Florida....  What an asset!!  It helped to find restaurants, lodging and points of interest quickly and easily.  It gives you a real reference point to see what's around you.... LOVE IT!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 3
I love this app! It has been sooo useful for finding hotels and restaurants. I especially like the "Near me now" feature. However, it would be really helpful if some features like the saved restaurants/attractions were accessible offline since when traveling, it is not always possible to use Internet.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-16 1
Difficult to use, have to repeat steps; makes entering a review a total chore; makes you do way more work than before.  They asked me for the address i am adding as a favor to their site?

My god, what has happened to Trip Advisor? Did they do any usability testing at all? They ought to pay attention to their own reviews.  I am so disappointed with this new upgrade, I wanted to get out of this app 2 minutes after I started!!! Terrible, terrible....
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
Found the perfect B&B for our anniversary from my phone--and avoided a few disastrous motels. For the app, I wish the list of venues had an icon showing which Ive reviewed and visited. Like Gowalla.
Version 8.5 2014-02-27 5
This app is so nice to have if your looking for lodging, attractions, or restaurants in an unfamiliar area as fast as possible. Quicker and less confusing than doing a Google search.
Version 8.3.1 2014-03-03 5
I never plan a trip without this app or the full site. It's full of real reviews from people like myself, so you can trust what you're reading. I absolutely love this app!
Version 5.8 2011-09-24 5
I nearly always rely on Trip Advisor when I travel, and the Trip Advisor app makes it very easy to find the best of anything, even when I'm not near my computer.  Get this app - you'll love it!
Version 6.6 2013-04-08 5
I use the app all the time to find anything I need about traveling. The reviews have always been accurate. I would recommend this app to everyone.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-13 5
I love to review places as I pay the check when it's fresh in my mind. I also feel like I have a vote in helping smaller businesses survive that deserve the positive reviews.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-14 5
I have found a good value of tripadvisor to all traveller to learn about an exact place before going there. 

I would recommend to all for your traveling tips
Version 6.4 2012-08-31 5
So easy to navigate and great information! I would recommend this app for any travel research.  It's got a comprehensive selection of various travel reviews and helpful photos.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-12 3
It's too bad you can't give helpful votes via the app or mobile. Makes me wonder if no one really likes my reviews or if they do and just can't let me know. Should I even bother leaving them? I made this suggestion about a year ago and still no update. You can give a thumbs up on the Yelp app.
Version 5.9 2011-11-22 5
Now that I have an ipad2, working with trip advisor to plan my trip to Chicago is amazing. So easy! Love the reviews. Easy to decide where to stay and what to see.
Love you tripadvisor!
Version 5.9 2011-11-24 5
Love it! At first thought it was another advertizing gimmick but actually this is a  very useful tool to check out new places. Now I use it all the time.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
Use the TripAdvisor app all the time, often to select/make reservations, but also to choose a place to eat on the fly when on a road trip.  Couldn't live without it!!
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
I found Tripadvisor years ago and it is very helpful. Great for locating B and Bs. I have used it for travel in Italy, Scotland, Ireland, England, and the USA. The app works great.
Version 6.1 2012-06-19 5
We use Tripadvisor as our go to travel info sight.  We travel a fair amount and find great tips, as well as sharing our experiences.  We look for value rather than luxory.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 5
Easy go use app for all types of travelers.  Mobile access requires very little bandwidth which is key when traveling.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 4
Helpful app for arranging travel plans. It's organized with headings that make easier to find exactly what you want whether it's a hotel or B & B, or sit down or fast food restaurant. It's also nice to view reviews of my work in the tour industry.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Absolutely love the website, and the mobile app makes everything so much more accessible for on the go. Can't wait to use this while traveling soon!
Version 5.8 2011-09-28 4
Works just like the site, only problem is it brings back some resulta with the incorrect price range, there should be some edit option where we could correct the price ourselves, or someone who could check the prices oftenly!
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 5
I used this app to set up our trip to Europe and it was a total success. This is an example of the real power of Internet when people use it for the good of others.  Great site.  Great unbiased info.
Version 5.0.1 2011-08-09 5
Just spent 25 minutes laughing uncontrollably at the horrifically bad reviews for a place we were thinking of staying. Thank you, Trip Advisor! This app rocks.
Version 5.5 2011-04-29 5
The first place I look for places to see and things to do in a travel destination.
I love being able to read the reviews and get different perspectives on restaurants and hotels before making a decision to go there.
Version 5.7 2011-07-14 5
Great to use in foreign countries where you don't know what's around the cities to eat. It's very convenient for finding places close to your hotel if you need to walk to them.
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 4
The one thing that would make it better is if you could sign into Facebook with the app. I already have information saved within the Facebook version of this app. It would be great to integrate that information within this app as well.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-25 2
Wrote a review on my iPhone hit submit, it told me to log in which I did. hit submit again and it gave me an error stating that I was missing something and the review couldn't be submitted, then it kicked me back to the page of the place I was trying to review and discarded my review. Guess I'll do it again later from my tablet and make sure I check all the right boxes.
Version 6.0 2012-03-26 5
We traveled to Ft. Myers Beach for the first time in March 2012 and did not know where to go for breakfast and dinner.   Trip Advisor helped us find a great breakfast bagel and a fabulous fresh fish restaurant.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
Have used Tripadvisor for years on the web. App duplicates most of the functionality and appears to be a cleaner interface. Great for use on the road.
Version 5.8 2011-08-29 5
If you travel and dont have this app, what are you waiting for? I have used the recommendation and suggestions all over the world.  User are pretty honest about their reviews.
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 5
Used for search cities for work and personal travel.  It's great in the us and abroad. Very reliable.  Helps to get good information that google won't give you.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 5
I have no problems with this app. I absolutely LOVE that I can get recent and relevant reviews before I waste my time and money. Hubby and I use it all the time when we're out of town.
Version 6.6 2012-12-21 5
I like the app.  It is attractive and easy to get around.  I am not sure why I have to login each time even though I specify to remember me, but that is the only annoyance.
Version 5.9 2011-12-31 5
This app helps find information about activities, food and hotels that are nearby. It's especially handy when staying without a car.
Version 5.7 2011-08-05 5
my wife and I have used plenty of sites and trip advisor and jet setter are the best to forecast a vacation!!! must use must download if u have a smart phone/tablet!!!
steve b,

Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
It was just a complicated phone with benefits until I was traveling and wanted to find a very good, very close restaurant- TA app was a revelation. Why can't all apps be this easy & useful?
Version 6.0 2012-03-13 5
As title,all the reviews in this app really help me a lot. The hotels and results which are highly ranking are all good. Save me a lot of time for looking around to find some good hotels and restaurants.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 4
I use this all the time before I start a trip. Even if some places are closed. I will open tripadvisor app instantly for other near by places.

The only prob is the address are not clear for uncommon places.

However I like this app a lot.  A way to explore new places!!!!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-12 5
What a great way to find some wonderful places to eat and stay.  We haven't been disappointed.
We've had great meals and crisp sheets and comfortable beds since. It makes travel so much more fun.  Thanks
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 5
For the constant Road Warrior "Up in the Air", and I do NOT mean George Clooney, this takes all the work out of searching or reviewing. Thank you Trip Advisor! I wish that you had this app several decades ago!
Version 5.9 2011-12-03 5
Exceptional app, easy to use and very functional.  Makes negotiating for a room so easy.
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
I've been to many places and I trust the ratings in the app above everything. It does really take you to the best (and near you) spots everywhere.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-13 4
My favorite website for any. & all information for travel, restaurant, & the like. It enables me to know what places to go immediately just by reading a few reviews. I'm so glad to have Trip Adviser at my fingertips!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-28 4
This is a good travel app if you already like to use the website. I wish it would store my account info more easily, keep me logged in and have a section for my reviews. Other than this it seems to function as intended.
Version 8.2 2013-12-12 4
All the travel apps have missing features but this owl is near perfect. The reviews are key to their success - and we all benefit from so many honest and insightful contributors. Easy to use and find good suggestions.
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 3
Helpful  but a bit clumsy with slow internet connections, which are common when I travel abroad and could use suggestions.  Takes way too long to load!  Disappointed there is no way to upload photos or view profiles like on the website.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-15 5
This app can save you from wasting good money at bad places.  Read at least 5 or 10 reviews before deciding.
Version 6.1 2012-05-25 5
Looking for something to help find everything you need for a trip this is the app. This app help keep my family best while traveling cross country to our new  home.
Version 6.1 2012-06-10 4
This app made traveling to Australia and New Zealand a breeze.  The iPhone version has a weak search and map system and it's still difficult to search say "Best Western" nearby to quickly check reviews. Aside from that it's fabulous.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
We used this app during our vacation in Puerto Rico. It was AMAZING!! We thought it was a spectacular tool to have for finding our restaurant options, maps, hotels -- the perfect travel companion! A must have app!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-01 5
I have used this app for a number of years. It is the most helpful for checking out sites and places to stay worldwide. I also write reviews myself to help fellow travelers.
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
Finally the app that allows me to do my travel research on the fly. Any business traveler will tell you that plans change rapidly so you need to have real reviews handy at all times.
Version 5.7 2011-08-07 5
Absolutely phenomenal app. First time in Gatlinburg, and this app is making it super easy to find a place to eat dinner. So easy to navigate through and customize.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 5
Our family loves the Trip Advisor website and we have used it for a long time. We are excited about the iPhone app as we now have all the great features on the go with us.
Version 8.3 2013-12-31 3
TA is a REALLY useful group review site for hotels and activities in an area. It helped us a lot when we were stuck without a hotel late at night.

My request for improvement is for the App functionality. There's lack of access (as far as I can see) to your own reviews and image uploads.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
Driving from miami to las vegas with wife and baby. This has been the best app i have found for everything that i need it to find on the highway. Easy to use and precise, great job!
Version 6.4 2012-09-08 5
I made such great use of this app. Initially I used it to plan some of the meals on my vacation. As for the rest, I winged it and used the app to find some really great restaurants in my vicinity.
Version 6.4 2012-09-08 5
I can't complain so far!  I am able to find things and make educated decisions and hopefully help people out as well when going to places.  Very helpful!  :-)
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 4
The TripAdvisor app is a great tool for those on vacation.  The mapping features come in handy, showing points of interest as you drive.  I wish it had the full functionality of the webs site, but this is not a complaint, just a wish for the future.
Version 6.2 2012-07-04 5
This app is so easy to use and so helpful! I travel for work frequently and use this app to locate restaurants and things to do in the are and to get user reviews on hotels.
Version 6.6 2013-03-26 4
I used it to plan ahead my stays for business or pleasure. My wife got me into it. Nice to used when you are looking for restaurants and or safe places to visits when I'm abroad.

  I highly recommend to use it when overseas.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-02 5
Works wherever we go in the world.  Currently trying it out in Korea! Most entries for places are in English. Though as you would expect many are in the host countries language.
Version 7.0.1 2013-08-05 5
I use TA regularly to help me research trips and find  lodging and restaurants.  I trust the reviewers and the comments are usually very accurate. Really wouldn't do without this app.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
Amazing people!  Wait on you hand and foot!  Luis and Carlos are the best waiters.  Alex and Alice worked hard to find our lost luggage.  Our favorite was Isaias!  He helped us with our excursions.
Version 3.0 2009-10-14 3
Works well on my iPhone but database is woefully out of date. Prior reviews also note this. Too bad there is no way for users to clear old data out. Some listings in my area have been gone for nearly 10 years and some appear to be business listings for private caterers rather than places one could eat.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 4
Fab App showing all the great places, activities, and food in any location you visit! I love reading real people's reviews of local attractions and their candid remarks. Often guides me.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-08 5
Very handy tool for finding hotels.  Let's me read the reviews, check amenities, and see photos.... As well as compare prices.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
I like both to plan carefully and to improvise, and this app lets me do both, on the fly. I'd say our trip to new England was at least 50% improved by this app and Yelp.
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
Another one of those apps that I couldn't live without when traveling! It relies on audience participation. So if you read it, make sure you post too!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-31 5
I found this app super helpful for building a basic schedule for my family vacation. Now not one mundane meal nor tourist trap will hamper the festivities!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 5
The interface is nice and easy to use, loading speeds are very fast, and it has everything you would need for what you're looking for. I reccomend this app
Version 1.0 2008-07-15 1
Right from the start it (the program) asks you / or tries to determine your position (Location)... that's nice, however, it NEVER determines your position. It only tells you to try again, and again...etc. That tells me that this program is poorly thought out or written. 
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 5
A very useful iPad version of the site. Pictures are easy to scroll through (even moreso than the site) and reviews easy to follow!  An app any traveler should have and will use regularly.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 2
I tried to find a link to write a review on the iPad app because the website said it was having maintenance issues. I went to the hotel entry and there is no link to write a review. What is the problem here?

I am a loyal Trip Advisor fan but I hate the fact that using it on the PC, iPhone and iPad are all different experiences. I seem to find what I need fastest on the regular site. Best to stay with that.
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 5
Love the new layout.  Currently living and traveling abroad and use trip advisor as a reference for everything!  Hotels are always spot on, but restaurant reviews can be iffy.  Thanks for all the help!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-07 5
I use this app as my primary travel tool. There are a few times it doesn't have the best deal listed, but the majority of the time it has great information . Highly recommend !
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Tripadvisor is the best website out there for anyone traveling. It's my number One go to website for anything locally or internationally. The reviews and tips are spot on and allow you to make informed decisions.
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
This app is very comprehensive, intutive and so easy to use. It bring the bundle of good information right into the Ipad screen in a very compact way. Use this app very extensively.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
This a like a thesaurus when you want information on travel! I use this to check ratings of hotels and restaurants more then any other website! It is extremely user friendly!
Version 5.7 2011-07-26 4
If the application opened to where the user last left off, or at least gave the user the option to do so, it would be even better. Overall, it is only a minor hassle and does little to detract from the overall quality of the application.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 3
I have been using trip advisor since last two years and found to be very useful in many occasions. There are times when reviews are manipulated by people and trip advisor should add some sort of artificial intelligence to prevent that happening to save people from thugs.
Version 6.1 2012-06-14 5
Tripadvisor always gives me revalent information no matter where I'm traveling or eating. I always check hotel suggestions before I go.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 4
Love this app, only problem I've had is that it won't let me log in. It tells me to log in, then says there is no account under my email, so I try creating an account and it says one already exists under my email. Very frustrating.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-17 2
On a trip this summer, we tries numerous times to book rooms with this app. For one thing, the rate was always 50+ dollars cheaper on the app than the motel was. The motel said we had to book thru the app to get that price but the app never would give me a confirmation number. I think the app had quoted too cheap and couldn't get a room. Had a lot better luck with other travel apps.
Version 6.0 2012-03-29 5
I travel for a living and use the app. all the time ... for looking up places to eat, stay and see, and then to rate them once visited. We've been on the road for 20+ years and Trip Advisor rates right at the top!
Version 6.5 2012-09-13 4
Trip Advisor is very helpful to research local restaurants, and is an invaluable tool when out of town. I have used it many times and find others reviews, while sometimes very different, very helpful.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 4
Love the map view! Makes the app worth using over the website.  Good info on hotels. Wish you could filter your search to certain brands. Also it would be great if you could pin attractions that you're trying to stay near.
Version 6.2 2012-07-08 4
Would have rated it 5 stars but it doesn't pull up all the places when you are trying to write a review. I googled "Bakery" which lead us to a fantastic local owned bakery. Went on Trip Advisor to write a review, but it wouldn't recognize it so I couldn't leave a review.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-17 5
Having been using trip advisor for quite a few years, I find the ap to be very useful.  I have never had any difficulties with it,  very user friendly.
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 2
My main complaint is that for some reason this app does not find all the hotels in a town or city and it doesn't allow you to search nearby towns or cities to expand your search. Ot would be nice to search by map like their website. Finally, when I go to their website from my phone it brings up their app! Very frustrating when you are on the road.
Version 5.91 2012-01-14 5
I love this app!  I use it on every trip to try new places to eat and stay.
I see that your website is now covering vacation rental homes and I'm hoping that a future update to this app will cover vacation rentals as well.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-13 5
Love the regular website and the app makes it twice as easy to find all your travel info!
It's a great reference  for trip planning, day tripping or local exploring!
Version 8.3 2013-12-30 5
On vacation this app can save you from bad experiences and wasted money. Even in town I use it so we don't walk in to a bad situation. I highly recommend this app!!!!
Version 8.3 2014-01-04 5
This is where I check first before going anywhere! The app is easy to use and I am thankful for this website for helping with all my travel needs!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 4
I'be found that I use Trip Advisor over the others like Yelp for instance more and more. Primarily because the reviews tend to be more accurate. I like having this app on my phone for quick referencing. Nice job.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 5
LOVE IT!!!  This was my go-to app to plan my stay-cation in NYC.  I found the most amazing things to do around the city.  I would highly recommend this as a source to my family and friends.
Version 6.6 2013-04-05 5
I've come to rely on Trip Adviser wherever I roam.  I've found the consumer-supplied ratings to be pretty accurate in identifying great food and great places to stay.
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 4
This App is one that I use daily. Not only do I like the well thought out travel components, but I have become heavily dependent on the forums for their timely, reliable travel discussion.

Great job!
Version 6.6 2013-01-03 5
Great app especially if you have cellular Internet where you are, but if you don't, make sure you look everything up before you go out of the hostel/hotel.
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
I have long been a fan of Trip Advisor, so naturally it was one of the first apps I downloaded on my iPhone and iPad. I check Trip Advisor when planning ANY trip...
Version 5.92 2012-01-25 5
I'm finding very handy for checking and view all the hotels from different cities around the world!! Excellent!!
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
I have used this app for easy access to a wealth of info for planning and for last minute needs while oh the road. I highly recommend it!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
It is great to hear what impresses customers most.  TripAdvisor helps us focus on what people love and address things we can improve!  Thanks for helping first timers choose us!
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I'm able to post pics right away as I review the hotel I'm staying in. I choose hotels not by the professional pics only and it allows me to give credit to those hotels that go the extra mile
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 5
When my phone doesn't seem to be understanding me, I can always go to Trip Advisor and find a phone number to a hotel or directions to a restaurant. Thank you, thank you!!!'
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 5
Very helpful for those of us who are looking for some advice from travelers who have preceded us.  Best to do your own research of course but this is a good starting point.
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 5
I love the reviews and photos that are submitted by actual visitors. It's always good to read about the experiences of "real-life travelers" (good or bad) before investing in a trip or stay at particular location.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-12 5
Every time I decide to travel, the first thing that I look is at trip advisor. It has never let me down. Each time I travel to a different place, I'm so grateful for trip advisor.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
I use tripadvisor constantly, even for local dining and attractions. I have found the reviews here especially helpful.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
I use Tripadvisor for ALL of my vacation planning throughout the year. I can always count on plenty of reviews and a friendly user interface. LOVE the app, their website, everything!
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 5
Just downloaded this app. to my new iPad and can't believe how easy it is to use!  Was able to look up airfare to our next destination in mere seconds....what a great app!
Version 6.6 2013-04-17 5
Tripadvisor is one of my favorite apps/websites.  I wouldn't think of traveling without using it before I go and during my trips.  Awesome  reviews have never let me down.
Version 6.6 2012-12-17 5
I would never plan a trip without it. Even when using a travel agent I double check with trip advisor if I really want to stay in the hotel they book!
Version 5.93 2012-03-02 5
This app is the best source of information for travel. You get first hand info right from people just like you who have been there and done that.
Version 6.6 2013-04-16 4
Best travel app ever can give me great places to go any time! I get reviews of restaurants, places, and a lot more! I can even look up how to get there my only complaint is you can only look up towns but not neighborhoods like Manhattan
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 5
I love Trip advisor and it is always very helpful when I travel out of town. It is so much easier to find a good restaurant or attraction when I'm in an unfamiliar city with this app.
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
We travel allot and regularly use TripAdvisor for our dinner and events.  They send me updates on who has found my review helpful.  Feels like a real family.
Version 5.7 2011-08-03 5
I was apprehensive when reading reviews. I find Trip Advisor to be honest and trustworthy. On my recent trip to Europe, I relied on Trip Advisor recommendations for my hotels. I found them to be 95% accurate.
Version 5.7 2011-07-06 5
I work in Asia and need to research all over the world for hotels and meeting space.  This app has helped me streamline my work by making it easier and more accessible on my iPad.
Version 5.8 2011-09-03 5
I'm on a trip in LA and it has been a lifesaver.  It provides you with hotels, restaurants and gas stations from your current location.  The days of driving around in circles are over!  Thank you.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-15 5
This application is very much help us tp plan our vacation, no doubt tripadvisor always give best reference :D
Version 5.5 2011-05-01 5
Wow this app has been fabulous in researching an upcoming trip to Tuscany. It has the reviews, photos, maps, and even street view of driving through the area. I hilly recommend it.
Version 5.92 2012-02-14 5
I have used trip advisor and love it. It is a useful tool, giving map locations, reviewing reviews, and sharing photos. I've also shared my own experiences as well. Ty Trip Advisor for being sooo handy.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-27 5
Our travels now are rarely disappointing because we follow people who have similar taste & service expectations!!

Love love love it!!!
Version 6.6 2013-03-21 5
This App is like asking dozens of neighbors what they thought of a certain place they visited. It's a must do on any trip planning.
Version 5.9 2011-11-13 5
My family and I would get stuck in a rut trying to decide on great restaurants, but the Trip advisor app puts information right at your fingertips while out and about.
Version 6.6 2012-12-01 5
Just recently planned an entire trip locally with the app. As long as you read all the reviews, you get a good opinion. Easy to search and easy to use. It's free, give it a try
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-25 5
I have been using Trip Advisor for several years, and it has made my hotel and restaurant experiences 100% better!  I couldn't plan a trip without it now!
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
Very powerful thing and what's important that hotels and restaurants teams are really worry about their reputation here so they are trying to improve provided services for us to get better reviews )))
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
This app saved me from staying in a horrible hotel during a trip to New Orleans.  Thanks to everyone that has posted pictures and reviews!
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
So far, of all my apps, I am the most impressed by this one. I am planning a driving trip in California and selecting my hotels using this app as I virtually drive up the coast. Very cool.
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
We are going to Kauai in October and TripAdvisor has already been helpful with our planning. The reviews from other travelers help us to make decisions on lodging and restaurants.
Version 8.1 2013-11-07 5
Using TripAdvisor to plan my trip to Italy. Pretty awesome to see other travelers' reviews to decide where I want to go. Easy to use and understand. Must have if you love to travel!
Version 8.3 2013-12-27 5
Ever since we started traveling I began planning our vacation based on the reviews from trip advisor they are very accurate in return I began to post my own reviews...love this app
Version 8.4 2014-02-02 5
Always check out a new place on Trip Advisor before going the first time. Great insights from locals and visitors alike.
Version 5.5 2011-04-29 5
I discovered this app before our vacation in Pigeon Forge, TN. It was awesome to look up attractions and see other people's experiences before spending our money on them. Highly reccomended!
Version 5.6 2011-06-01 5
I look at TA everyday. The iPhone app is good but on iPad is where it is really amazing! The only thing I would like to see would be a place to make my default view my choice: i.e. Hotels, restaurants, see
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-22 5
There is no yelp in South America and we used this to help us find every meal. The city guide is available for some cities- and basically guided us through buenos aries. Highly recommend!
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5
Even better user experience than regular Internet page. The location based services are really helpful when trying to find restaurant recommendations. Good job!!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-17 5
This is the most consistently useful app I have. I know that my time spent traveling the world has been made easier by having the reviews of hotels, restaurants and attractions at my fingertips.
Version 5.8 2011-08-19 5
I downloaded this app and within five minutes was able to successfully plan a dinner in a new town.  Good stuff.  The "near me" search was choice.
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
We enjoyed the crab cakes and shrimp spring rolls were excellent!! The atmosphere is enjoyable and service is friendly. We would recommend the cottage to anyone visiting siesta key.  Our server Michael
Version 8.5 2014-03-07 2
Noisy! The boiler sounds like a plane turbine every 10-15 minute cycle, accompanied by whiffs of natural gas, and we can hear everyone's bath water gurgling. Curtains installed over, not beside, the windows block the view. And NO comfortable chairs or lazy boy, just stiff sofa and oversize chair. Nice pool and hot tub and exercise room, but NO resort activities.
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 4
:-)
Finding surprising and interesting sights, but also missing A LOT of the important top sights and activities in both Sweden and Denmark.
I strongly suggest to include a submit sight / activity from within the app. I really miss that!
Version 5.9 2012-01-04 5
Just got this app for my iPad and it is great. Great for my co-captain status on our road trip. Connected to my AT&T so I get the GPS as well. Great to find restaurants nearby, etc. very easy to write reviews as well.
Version 6.6 2013-01-26 5
Whenever I travel I use trip advisor for hotels, places to eat and sightseeing. It never steers me wrong. Found some great places I'd never have tried otherwise and avoid a few bad ones too!
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 2
The new (complete rewrite) version is a disappointment.  Very slow to no response to photo paging requests, lack of hotel search facility for a given city and incomplete searches for hotels.  These are just a few problems I noted on first use of rewritten app.  Needs some work.  Hopefully there will be an update released soon.  This used to be a great app.
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 5
One of the best travel apps I have used and I have tried several. Extremely well organized feeding off of their great reviews and user contributed pictures.  Can't beat it for the price!
Version 5.9 2011-11-08 5
Ever wonder whether that restaurant, hotel, resort, or golf course is a good idea? Worry no more - you can find great info on Trip Advisor. I don't know which I enjoy more - writing reviews or reading them.
Version 6.2 2012-06-19 5
I always check with Trip Advisor when looking for a hotel.  I write lots of reviews . The app makes it much more convenient.  It is easy to use.
Version 6.2 2012-06-20 5
I refer to this app first when planning a trip. It has lots of information, maps, etc for virtually any place in the world. It certainly is a good starting point for your adventures!
Version 6.6 2013-01-10 4
Like the full web site, trip advisor is chock full of accessability to much, much info.  The game remains how to navigate for what you need without heading somewhere you don't want to. Same-o, same-o, just less screen!
Version 6.1 2012-04-05 5
As a road warrior I find this app to be a useful tool for restaurants and hotels.  At times the reviews are too personal ("the receptionist was rude") but overall the reviews are objective and helpful.   it's a very useful app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
This app is well prepared and user friendly. Loved the "My Saves" option, which categorizes favorites by location. 
Wish to have an option to email My Saves.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I travel for business and pleasure roughly 20-25 days a month and find useful info on Trip Advisor for 95% of the places I go. It is good for business travel and essential for vacation travel.
Version 6.5 2012-09-20 5
I like to travel and eat at random but good restaurants. Trip advisors helps my find the best place. It has cool location based searches and saved places for trips.
Version 8.3 2013-12-28 5
It's a must when it comes travel, dining, the amount of information is massive. It's a must when it comes to smart phones now a days
Version 6.3 2012-07-19 5
Perfect for planning a vacation, a weekend getaway, or night out. It's community spans the globe and provides excellent, and unbiased, reviews. Don't leave home without it.
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 5
I've always been a big fan of Trip Advisor and never go anywhere without clearing it through TA first, but this app makes the experience easier and even more fun to explore. Thanks!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
Love this app..can't count the number of times we've made choices based on reviews we've read there. Seems every place in every town has been covered! Thanks, guys.
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 5
Used this site on my computer for a couple of years. The iPhone app and iPad apps are so handy for home, vacations and business trips, alike.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 5
Love having this app available, especially when traveling.  You can get reviews of almost anything in a city or country right when you need it.
Version 5.9 2011-12-02 5
Doing a quick check can save you from a less than desirable experience.  It has us!
Version 5.93 2012-03-06 4
Trip Advisor is my go to app for getting reviews on restaurants and hotels.
Very convenient and simple to use. 
I appreciate everyone who takes the time out to leave a review of places they've been. Y'all have saved me unnecessary headaches several times!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-01 5
We don't book anything without checking Trip Advisor.  And, it provides a great opportunity to give feedback on our experiences.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-11 5
Helps you plan before you go. Enjoy while you're there. And remember where you went when you get back. Simply awesome.
Version 5.8 2011-10-12 5
This is a excellent app and it give me price for cheap ticket and convent location  better than any other app. If you travel a lot you have to download this app. I give it two thumbs up
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 1
I have read online skepticism about the validity of TripAdvisor's recommendations that were actually posted by them.  So on a recent vacation with our extended family we reviewed the hotels and places we ate and submitted them to TripAdvisor.  Much to my dismay I found that TripAdvisor was VERY selective on what they posted.  In my opinion, I have to wonder what kind of arrangement they may have with certain resorts and hotel chains.
Version 6.6 2012-12-08 5
A great place to read many interesting, sad and funny experiences of others as well as obtain useful information. This is a great app and very user friendly on iPhone and iPad.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-23 5
I am very happy with the helpfulness of Trip Advisor.  Today I am in Wichita Kansas. I have never been here before. Trip Advisor  has helped me find attractions and restaurants. I love this app!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-07 5
I love this app. It could not be easier to use and provides me with any and every bit of information I need to plan my trip- either before or during. Great job!
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
I use this App almost on a daily basis. I recently have started to submit some of my own reviews. Excellent concept and extremely helpful.
Version 5.93 2012-02-26 4
I had several Apps on my iPad to help me find restaurants and activities but none of them measure up to Trip Advisor. This app is very easy to use and provides useful and accurate information in whatever city i am visiting. I am very glad I found this app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-18 4
Enjoyed our honeymoon at the bed & breakfast for one night!  Had the pleasure to taste home-made rhubarb pie and bought a jar of the home-made rhubarb jam and a bottle of the orange liquor!  The host and hostess were delightful to meet and the location was charming.
Version 5.7 2011-08-09 4
The App is fantastic very user friendly. I just tried writing a review of a hotel and want to add pics, every time I submit a pic, it kicks me out of the App.  The good thing is my review was still there when I went back in and searched for the hotel.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-12 5
Outstanding.i use it all the time to plan travel abroad. I noticed that it is very popular throughout Europe. Hotels really take the trip advisor rating of their facility very seriously!
Version 5.8 2011-10-15 5
This app brings everything I like about the trip finder website with the convenience that I've come to enjoy from iPad apps. Easy to use.
Version 6.3 2013-02-25 5
Tripadvisor is my go-to website before booking any hotel anywhere! This app is convenient for everything from researching to booking. Very pleased :)
Version 8.2 2013-12-01 5
An extremely helpful app to locate hotels, restaurants and things to do. Easy to navigate around the app and very intuitive.  A must have app for checking out restaurants.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 5
I have used this app countless times while traveling the reviews are very helpful, I have joined TA with reviews the more people review the better the app. Best traveling app.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-26 5
Amazing service, super-duper fun! Ask for James Bond, Edward Luciano & Nabuk at the various activities on the resort, and when at the bar, ask for Ynocencio! His drinks are awesome!!!!
Version 8.0 2013-10-14 3
App works fine, but I'd like to be able to fully view my account (contributions as an example) on the app. Also, the rating functionality is limited on the app versus the website - the app only allows you to give an overall rating and doesn't break it down further.
Version 8.3 2013-12-30 5
Trip Advisor is my go to app for all travel and has revolutionized the way I travel. I enjoy the functionality of it and the fact that I can explore new places.
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
Have you trip advisor in planning vacations in the past, and now looking forward to using it through my iPhone.
Version 5.8 2011-10-20 5
I love this!  Have never been given bad information.  Enjoy reading the reviews and looking at the traveler's photos.  Always come here first when starting to plan a trip.
Version 6.6 2013-03-27 5
This app is very helpful in planning trips.   The reviews can be grouped and viewed together by trends of what reviewers are "saying".  Also has lots of pictures!
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
I've been a Trip Advisor fan for years  using my desktop. But it's good to have a mobile app as well while traveling or just searching from home.
Version 5.92 2012-02-05 4
Gives many tools to plan and on site to modify plans in real time. Reviews and links useful. Restaurants may not take into consideration level of cuisine. Such as #2 of 58 restaurants is a pizza pub. More filtering would be useful.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
The most important thing about tripadviser is the reviews section and I am grateful that there are enough opinions to get an adequate hearing on most things.
Version 8.2 2013-12-17 5
Good App but not always accurate when searching. The website is better but the App is the best way to search when travelling.
Version 5.6 2011-05-17 5
Downloaded it as an afterthought while on location in Philippines.  Looking for forums or reviews on guesthouses in semi-remote Tacloban.  Extremely helpful app.  Would download again!  Haha!! 5 stars.
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
Whether traveling abroad or just looking for something fun to do locally this app has it all with its user friendly interface and finds great prices on flights.
Version 5.9 2011-11-13 5
I always go to Tripadvisor for information on a hotel or resort before I book.  Reviews and traveler photos have aided in my ability to book perfect vacations!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-30 5
This app works really well on al apple products. I love it because i can write all my reviews right away versus waiting to come home on my laptop. Very accurate!
Version 5.7 2011-08-18 5
Accurate info, many listings, helpful info when deciding where to stay on a road trip. Definitely a must have for me.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 4
Just downloaded the app after looking at recommendations on the website. Easy to use and apparently fair assessments of the restaurants I have looked at. Like the ranking, makes it easier to get consensus on where to go. Eg only a top 50 place, for example.
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 5
With several trips planned this summer, I've started relying on this app for local restaurants' reviews for planning our meals. I'be not been disappointed. Thanks to the reviewers!!
Version 6.6 2013-04-04 5
I will always book my hotel through this site. It is helpful with all the reviews plus shows you all the prices from different booking websites. 

Love it!!!!!
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
I do not plan any trip without using trip advisor.  The app works very well and is updated constantly!  I would 100% recommend trip advisor.
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
This app helped me avoid some of the tourist traps while on vacation! It helped getting around a city that was very confusing in layout
Version 5.6 2011-08-06 2
This app is just okay. The main problem I have is that it doesn't let you access all the information on the website. I'm looking at vacation rental villas in Italy on my desktop through tripadvisor as I type this, but I cannot pull them up on the app. Even entering the exact name of the place yields no results. What's the point of the app if I have to go to the full site anyway?
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
Fast easy and very informative way of getting the inside scoop on places before u go there. Use your own judgement when believing some of the reviews. But at least this is a great place to get some good ideas beyond the advertisements.
Version 8.5 2014-03-01 4
This is a very informative app that's very useful when traveling for it's generally well considered reviews by people like us. The only drawback that I'd  like to see corrected is the lack of good maps.
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 4
I love reading and researching trip advisor. It's the best way to get the true vibe of hotel, especially knowing nothing about a new visiting city. And since working at a hotel, I appreciate the honesty, some reviews are to harsh and need weeding out, but 85%of the reviews I read, I agree with.
Version 5.9 2012-02-25 5
I'm an obsessive planner and I use trip advisor for planning all of my trips and now I use the app to plan activities while I'm on them. Love having the information at my finger tips at all times!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-25 4
I use Trip Advisor all the time on their Internet site. But two issues with their app: 1) can't do multi-city flights and 2) can't choose Premium Economy as a travel class. These are pretty basic functions. Otherwise it is good.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-25 5
This is a great site for the weary traveler. Always bear in mind that opinions vary, so read lots of reviews for a balanced assessment. User-friendly and chock full of good info.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
Use for anything that has to do with travel. The reviews and information is easy to use. The best phone app when traveling and need information quickly.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
This app is extremely easy to use, and has a very helpful layout that shows you the location of whatever you are looking up on the map on the side. Great app to use while traveling!
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 5
This app tells you, quickly, every possible option near you or where u may be going. Nice view through the camera as well. All around cool.
Version 8.2 2013-12-06 5
This app is pretty good, but it could use the info like Overview, Weather & When to go info, etc. I would like to see that info because it would be like the website.
Version 6.1 2012-06-15 5
Tells you exactly what you need to know. Having the comments from other people really helps out making your trip the best ever. I would recommend this app to anyone.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 3
Recent updates have improved the app but, still can't sort reviews based on ratings. I hate having to scroll through all the reviews just to try to find the bad ones. Please, please allow sorting of reviews again. Was available in previous versions, but no more.
Version 8.0.2 2014-03-31 5
This is one of the most user friendly apps I've experienced.  Having it at my thumbs allows me to submit reviews while the experience is fresh.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
Find it to be reliable. Consistent and accurate. We travel all over the US also used it in UK, Ireland, EU for hotels and restaurants.  I have it on my iPad and we use it as our number 1 guide.

Still rely on it
Version 6.6 2013-01-19 4
This app is excellent for making basic searches, but it is extremely difficult to narrow the searches; for example, trying to find bed and breakfasts in any particular area becomes a game of sorts, and not a fun one.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 3
The newest update seems to only want to link you to book a hotel room. You can't click on the ratings review to skip to just the good-bad-terrible reviews. At one point trip advisor was the only site I trusted to give real reviews. I don't feel the same anymore. It really is sad.
Version 5.8 2011-08-28 5
I have used the trip advisor Website for years and truly appreciate it for the honest everyday person opinion. Now its even handier in this app. I won't plan a trip without it.
Version 5.8 2011-10-28 5
App gets five stars for being useful and current. Annoying and intrusive popup demanding rating gets zero stars, since it apparently doesn't understand the meaning of "no thanks".
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5
Downloaded the trip advisor to help me navigate on a 10 day motorcycle ride through Canada with no set destinations. Came in extremely handy for lodging, where to eat and what to see! Excellent App!
Version 5.8 2011-09-11 5
Most informative. Use it all the time to book hotels for vacations. I always keep in mind each person is entitled to an opinion. Don't always believe the hype!  I have never been steered wrong!!
Version 5.9 2011-11-12 5
Really shocking the first time you press the "near me" button and find it actually works! Really excellent application. Would be killer app if it linked to a travel book...
Version 5.9 2011-11-30 4
The only reason I won't give this 5 stars is because you can't access your saved trips from your TripAdvisor account online. Wish they would link the two so when you save online you can get it on your phone.
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
So far all of the recommendations have been very accurate!  This app has made it very easy to find fun things to do wherever you are! Very pleased with this app!!!
Version 5.93 2012-02-29 5
Helped us plan great excursions, restaurants, hotels on 2 of our recent trips. Traveler review were exceptional helpful.
Site is easy to use, I wouldn't travel without it. 5+ stars
Version 6.1 2012-05-03 5
I have used this app when planning my last 2 vacations. And without it I would have been lost. All the reviews were sooo helpful and very easy to read on my iPhone.
Version 6.4 2012-08-23 5
This app is awesome! Handy app to have while traveling for lost & clueless single mom like me lol Best part are the photos, reviews, link to map/directions! Easy-Peasy!
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-01 3
Hi, 
I love your app, but I've been having a problem with the iPad version for it recently. The tab for the saved places and sights has become unavailable. I have no trouble finding on my iPhone, but the iPad app doesn't have it anymore. Hope you can resolve it soon!
Version 8.5 2014-03-20 2
This app seems like it's just mobile website stuffed in a wrapper.  Trying to load photos , especially after a filter will glitch and send you back a few steps. Very silo'd, difficult to navigate in and out of hotels in areas.... View photos and hit done, bam you are back to the start.   

Not sure why it has four stars.
Version 5.7 2011-06-30 5
This app I'd designed for I-pad so it makes a great app even better.. Easiest to read, no need to click and wait for maps to laid.. It's all right there on the same page. Can not travel without this app!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
Why would you NOT use others' help when choosing restaurants or travel options?  It's what these smartphone devices are made for - staying connected.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-23 5
Love this app. Have it on my iPhone, iPad and computer. They all sync. Nice. Use it on-the-go to look up restaurants and use it to research all our trips. The reviews and forums are great trip tools.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Very intuitive, search that actually finds stuff, very convenient. 
I have been trying some different travel apps and I find this one one of my favorites.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-30 5
I have found some of the best restaurants, hotels and attractions using this easy to use App.   It has also kept me away from some not very good ones!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-16 4
Room for improvement. Difficult to navigate and use with ease. Toggling between review mode and search mode is difficult and cumbersome. Still one of the best travel apps out there but tweaking it up a bit won't hurt. I still love it.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
Love this app! Helps me find great places for my family to visit that we might not know about. This app has never failed to find us great places to go and it's so easy!
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
This incredible app is an essential element for all of my vacation and travel planning. Flights, hotels, B&Bs, things to do, restaurants - this app captures them all!
Version 5.9 2011-11-03 5
I've used the Web version for years. Having it as a mobile travel companion is terrific!  It's saved me heartache and led me to undiscovered joys when I travel.
Version 5.92 2012-02-08 4
Great app!  Reliable and user friendly!

Could be better if there were more options:

1.  An option to see your listed reviews
2.  Administrative options, (i.e. account settings)
3.  Contributor updates and standings

Otherwise really good app :)
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 5
Trip advisor has become my new best friend when it comes to finding the best restaurant or hotel in a planned destination.  It has not let me down once. Even used it for our recent stay in Morroco!
Version 6.2 2012-07-11 5
I'll definitely be using this app on my next journey. When I compared the reviews to my own experiences I found they matched very well. Thank you.
Version 6.4 2012-09-09 5
I found a fantastic restaurant near my hotel, and booked it through the open table integration. My wife loved it, and we both remarked how TA saved the day.
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5
This app rocks!

Get the inside scoop on every aspect of the destination you're either at or planning on going to. A must have for all iPhone & iPad users.  It's functionality on my iPad2 is amazing!
Version 6.6 2013-03-19 5
I've travelled in and out of the U.S. And have found this app indispensable. I always check it out once I book a trip. This time I actually used it to find a place to go!
Version 6.1 2012-05-14 5
I never take a trip without first checking with trip advisor and when I leave I take trip advisor with me on my iPhone or iPad.  A definite trip essential.
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 5
This app is awesome!! You can leave feedback about a place you've been or check out reviews for a place you're thinking about going to.
Version 8.2 2013-12-17 5
I use this app from beginning to end when planning a trip or going out of town for business.  So convenient and easy to use.  Love the rating system!
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
I have used this on PC before I found the app. Use it for hotels mostly, but use it occasionally for restaurants. Reviews very useful. Don't leave home without it.
Version 5.9 2011-11-16 5
With this app I was able to research a dozen hotels in just as many minutes; the same searches took my sister a couple of hours!!  I highly recommend this app!
Version 6.6 2013-04-02 5
Wherever you are you are always connected to your guide and available to review any venue. Always helpful to learn experiences from others!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 5
I travel for work and for pleasure. This is one of the most helpful tools on the market. I love the flight tool which always helps to get the best fare available.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-15 5
Love that you can save your stops on a trip for easy reference. We've really benefitted from using Trip Advisor and loce the ease of access that comes with the app.
Version 6.3 2012-07-22 5
Fun to be able to write reviews on your favorite places to visit! Very helpful app for people who don't know the area where they are visiting! Will continue to use it and write my reviews.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-27 4
Tripadvisor is always my first choice for my travel information, not just for long travel but local places as well. Lots of information on lots of places I might not have known about if it wasn't for Tripadvisor.
Version 8.3 2013-12-26 5
Very good app. Use it all the time when I'm on the road for work. Better than using google maps for everything.
Version 8.3 2013-12-26 5
Very good app. Use it all the time when I'm on the road for work. Better than using google maps for everything.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Better than the iPhone app!  Intuitive and easy to use, which is key when you're in an unfamiliar city and are scrambling to find somewhere to eat or stay!
Version 8.2 2013-11-30 5
We use Trip Advisor all the before and during our travels. Most of the commentaries are very helpful in making our trips successful.
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
This is a great app...I love the email alerts.  It would be great if they added cruises.  I'd also like to buy event tickets from this app.  One of my favorite iPad apps for sure... It's free, get it already!
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 5
The Westin Gaslamp is a beautiful hotel and hosts one of the nicest staffs I have ever encountered. Everyone bends over backward to make you feel welcome and at home. "no" is not a word used often.
Version 5.8 2011-08-29 5
I've used this for just a few days now, preparing for a trip to Europe.  It is very helpful, combining maps, reviews, and rankings with an easy to use interface.
Version 5.9 2011-11-16 5
I am very grateful for this app. Was looking for somewhere to go with my hubby on our anniversary but also found something to do for my birthday in Paris.
Version 6.2 2012-07-04 5
Invaluable when considering where to spend your hard-earned money and holiday time!
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 5
I frequently use trip advisor,therefore I love having the handy app for my iPad! everything is easy to find and self explanatory. A must have app for on the road traveling!
Version 5.9 2011-11-24 5
This app is excellent. Trip Advisor is known as an excellent service and this app makes it even more user friendly. The fact that it's a free app makes it unbelievable. Download this app!
Version 6.6 2013-04-04 5
We have traveled across country three times....this was the go to app for restaurants and accommodation reviews.  We avoided a lot of disastrous choices my husband wanted....need I say more.
Version 5.8 2011-12-30 5
We have used trip advisor for several of our soccer tips with the kids to find restaurants and places to go after games and it has always come through for us!!!!
Version 6.2 2012-06-17 5
This is the first place I go when planning a trip. Love the reviews from locals and visitors; have found it to be right in the money. Great resource for travel ANYWHERE!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-04 5
Been using Trip Advisor for a long time now. I've gotten great advice. I'm a contributor too and decided I should review the app now. Get it. Use it.
Version 8.2 2013-12-07 5
My number one app for searching activities, checking reviews, planning travel, and coordinating plans with others!
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
I use it all the time on personal and business travel. Find out what others are saying about things in the area instead of just guessing or trying and being disappointed.
Version 5.92 2012-01-30 5
I always have to have a plan. Always. This app was great because it Gave me great ideas on what to do, where to go and and what to expect and I was able to have a great plan and a very memorable trip.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
I have found trip advisor very reliable.      Because it is written by travelers that actually have used the places and give unique reviews I really like it and use it all the time.
Version 6.6 2012-12-17 4
I love using this app to just find attractions in and around where I live and heading out somewhere with my family. So helpful! I took out a star because I wish it gave more info on the attractions. Otherwise, great!
Version 6.6 2013-02-01 5
Trip Advisor helps you make an informed decision when you are planning a trip.  It is reliable and the photos are a great way to visualize the place of interest.
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
My go to before I travel.  Gives a great overview of travel locations and activities.  Great way to share your experience as well.  Easily able to navigate the app.
Version 5.7 2011-08-03 5
It very important to know what to do and what restaurant you have in your town, this app gives you alot of reviews and shows the exact location of the place which is realy great
Version 5.4 2011-08-08 5
TripAdvisor is a savior ! Whenever we are out of town or just need a new place to go we just check the app. We are pleased with all the info we get through their app.
Version 6.5 2012-09-29 5
Always a great place to check before heading out. Was a wonderful aid when we traveled to Ireland. Didn't waste time or money on mediocre stops.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 2
This so-called app is hardly different in performance from going to the mobile website. The sluggish nature is enough to drive me to throw my phone out the window. I've even had the app prompt me to install the app, so it's obviously no more than a link to the website. 

On a positive note: The real user reviews, information and functionality are great.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-12 5
Great reviews given by users! I look forward to getting travelers opinions before setting out and giving mine when I'm done with a visit. Very easy to get and give reviews.
Version 5.0 2010-05-10 5
Big fan of TripAdvisor - and this is the cherry on top! What a nice improvement to the Local Picks app by adding hotels, flights and more! Really comes in handy on the go. I can even review places while I'm still there! Sweet!
Version 6.2 2012-06-29 5
Great when you're on the road. App loads quickly. Love that it's reviews from others. The reviews are usually dead on. We use it before going out to eat or going anywhere. Love it!
Version 6.3 2012-07-21 5
I have used Trip Advisor for years and depend upon it whenever and wherever I travel. This app has made it even easier to search locations and I use it regularly. It's awesome!
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 5
Tripadvisor is one of my favorite websites and I'm very happy with this app as well. The app is conveniently designed and very easy to use. Good job, Tripadvisor
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-23 4
A lot of times the pictures take a long time to load, other than that, it's a really good app. I'm using wifi and they fail to load or load slow, I use 3G and they load fast, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?
Version 6.1 2012-06-05 5
Honest, sometimes brutally honest, reviews by a wide range of travelers. Lots of pictures. Helpful advice.
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 5
Especially when looking for something to do or eat when visiting an unfamiliar area...or when looking for something new that is close to home!
Version 6.6 2013-05-29 3
TripAdvisor is terrific, very reliable reviews of hotels, restaurants, etc. the iPad app, however, is not well executed. I don't like being forced into landscape mode, and I find the review writing page to be impossible to use. Better to just log into the full site via the browser.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 5
I was looking for things to do in an area we are traveling to- this website is perfect and not only gave a map but reviews. I will use this site again and again
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
This app has helped me find everything from last minute hotels to everything I've been looking for such as resturant and things to do near by.  Love It:)
Version 8.5 2014-03-25 5
Fluid app with real reviews. Pretty accurate on rating scale with links to booking.
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 5
Would not want to travel without it. My family and I took a recent trip and this app could not have been more correct. Photos and tips are on point. Thank you so much.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 4
Great app that has everything one needs to search and review. I am able to be much more active on TA now than before! Would be even better if one could add a business that is not listed.... That would make it 5 stars in my opinion.
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 5
I love this app!  My husband and I take a week long road trip with no reservations every year, and the reviews on Trip Advisor help us find great hotels, food, and things to do!
Version 5.9 2011-12-22 5
The user's reviews are very helpful and the list of places provided usually fulfil my expectation. 
Greatly helpful App for travel plan.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
Love this app, anytime I need to find a restaurant, a place to stay, or any other business I check out the reviews whether I am traveling or looking locally. A terrific reference!
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 5
I refer to trip advisor for every trip I take, and always review every restaurant and hotel that we frequent.
I trust all of the feedback. This is all real feedback from real people.
Version 5.92 2012-02-16 5
I use Trip Advisor all the time. I won't go on a trip or new restaurant without consulting Trip Advisor first. My own personal, trustworthy advisor. Consistently awesome. Can you tell I'm a fan?
Version 6.2 2012-07-13 5
My husband got me hooked and I will never go anywhere without it or without putting a review. It's helped the last couple of weeks and has been spot on.

We had a great experience at this holiday inn & suites on top notch rd in Columbia, SC.  Our check in experience was awesome Leah was who helped us she was awesome very friendly, knowledgeable, great. Our room was great clean and comfortable
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-11 5
Traveling a lot for work I love this app! It helps me find great off the beat and path places to eat. It's super helpful when looking for specific types of food!
Version 4.0 2009-12-04 5
A great app now that it has the reviews available within the app. Also now lets you write reviews and take pics which makes it a pretty complete restaurant solution.
Version 5.9 2011-12-03 5
I consistently use Trip Advisor for determining everything from hotels, restaurants, local points of interest, and a host of different things. Highly recommend!
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
fantastic app, full of so much great information with ratings and reviews. Helping me plan out options for what i want to do and see months before my arrival to Indonesia
Version 5.9 2011-11-27 5
We use this app consistently when traveling. It has helped us find restaurants, hotels and things to do no matter where we are. It is like having a travel agent in your phone!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
I never know there are so many interesting place in my town! Not to mention how easy to use when traveling around the country. Thank god it's free !!!
Version 6.2 2012-07-05 5
I am trying to plan a family vacation and the online pictures have been great! Reality is quite different from the web site pictures.
Version 6.6 2013-02-23 5
I love this app on my phone and the iPad app is maybe my favorite.  Go anywhere, stay in a great hotel, eat well and thank TripAdvisor!  Oh yeah, and find a few fun things to do too.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 3
Fine app when browsing the restaurants, but what really made me angry is that you cannot access saved places when offline?!? I couldn't see the address of restaurants as I did not have the internet connection when I visited Italy.

Useless without net!
Version 5.9 2011-12-20 4
First glance is decent look and lot of options to proper evaluate your trip
Like navigation and forums,it might even get better if deals and comparisons would be easy to find
Thanks! Definitely worth of having one
Version 8.5 2014-03-13 5
I love this app.  It's reliable and whenever I dig or dislike a place, it is a snap to provide a review.  When I see the recommended sign in a window, I am happy to stop.
Version 5.7 2011-08-15 5
Impressive. Very much like the "regular" version. So helpful to have when on the go. Good job, TripAdvisor! One of the few computer to iPad apps that works as promised.
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 5
As long as tripadvisor keeps reviews coming in from real people, this will continue to be an excellent app.  I have been satisfied will the app while traveling.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 5
Most comprehensive of apps I use. 

Combines features of multiple apps into  one nice package. 

Becoming my go to app when I travel.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-19 5
I love this app. Use it every where I go, even in my home town. I use the off line app for the cities it is available.  Can't say enough good about tripadvisor.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-23 5
Joined trip advisor this spring. I find the reviews to be very helpful and want to contribute. I've picked and ruled out hotels based on trip advisors' reviews.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
I always check Trip Advisor for insights from fellow travelers. Sure, anyone can have a bad day and write an unfair review but the balance of all reviews paint a helpful picture.
Version 5.7 2011-07-22 5
This app is exactly what I wanted! I wanted a place to keep track of awesome restaurants I see on TV shows and I can with this app. The only thing I wish it could do is let you add notes to your saved places.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
I used to love this app. After the update, it is almost useless. There is no overall map function now.  And the individual map links take you to a separate safari page with Bing maps (which is impossible to use on the iPhone when you are walking around a place). Overall functionality went way down as well. Don't get this unless they bring back the map functionality of the old version.
Version 5.8 2011-08-19 5
This is a great app to research all things hotel, and dining. I use it on every trip now. Super easy to add reviews which is after what this site is al l about, "paying it forward".
Version 6.6 2013-03-25 5
I am really using this Tripadvisor to receive information about hotels restaurants, etc.  The reviews by others seem to be in line with my experiences at the places reviewed.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 5
Easy-to-use, only wish more people posted thanks they find in their local areas so people had a better idea of what they can do from a local perspective
Version 6.2 2012-07-12 4
Love having access to reviews and advice from other travelers!  I wish the mobile app was a little more like the full Internet version, though, with access to my own profile/reviews.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 4
Can be awesome if it had better sorting and more details to add to reviews. What time of day if it was your first trip occasion. A way to see who the review is. Also needs more participation and better sorting. Not just popular/ price
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
This is a must.  My family uses Tripadvisor every time we travel and have found the content to be accurate and the site easy to navigate.  It's even easier with the iPad app.  Highly recommended.
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5
I've learned to rely on Trip Advisor almost since they first hit the web.  This app just makes them more useful.  I never leave home without them.
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 5
Use app whenever you're traveling. Whether for business or personal, I can always find what I need. Love this app for planning out my travel.
Version 5.9 2011-12-26 5
In a short summation. Tripadvisor has not let us down. In hotels or attractions we were looking for they have us the best not from them but from people who use their services
Version 5.92 2012-01-23 5
Above I said, Great app that I've never experienced before as long as trip to abroad.
It's made of lots of useful information, great reviews and state of the art stuff.
Thumbs up.
Version 6.1 2012-04-27 5
iPhone 4s latest iOS. 5.01? No issues with crashes, I see all photos. Tripadvisor is my go to app, then TripIt to keep all my plans together. I travel a lot and I wouldn't be without TripAdvisor
Version 6.2 2012-07-02 4
There appears to be a bug in the ipad app. When submitting a review it keeps displaying red message asking to correct the red marked area whereas there is none to correct. I spent a lot of time submitting reviews and don't know whether these will be posted.
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 2
1. It's TripAdvisor not Yelp, why does the app default to my current location?
2. If you leave the app and come back it loses everything you were doing and puts you back at your current location. 
3. I can't find any place to save a list of favorites or places of interest, which would be really helpful when planning a trip. 

#2 is the killer and the reason I rated so low.
Version 5.7 2011-08-10 5
I Love this app.  I go to it first whenever planning any trip.  Great ease of use, very detailed, love the reviews from other travelers and map integration.  One of the best apps I have come across!
Version 6.6 2012-12-07 3
There seem to be many problems with this app. Sloppily assembled and a number of glitches that crash the iPad. Can't book rooms because the calendar doesn't let you move back.  Additional problems with the app being glitchy and crashing.
Version 6.6 2013-02-06 2
Find it annoying that when looking at specific restaurant in a list for a location and cuisine, and trying to go back to the list, Tripadvisor forgets location and/or cuisine and you have to start over.  For eg when go back to list, it will have other cuisines, then when try to respecify the cuisine, Chinese for eg, it shows restaurants all over the world.
Version 5.9 2011-11-11 5
This app has been so perfect for me and my friends! My home is in Central Ohio, but I go to school in Northern California so obviously I'm not familiar with the area! This app has led us to some great adventures!
Version 8.5 2014-03-23 5
We travel a lot and we find this app indispensable. We are so happy with TripAdvisor that we started posting reviews and always use this app - wonderful!
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 4

Version 5.93 2012-03-10 5
I live trip advisor and to access to it so quickly through the ap is just awesome. Check it out before you book anything from dining to extended vacations. The best
Version 5.6 2011-05-30 5
I always test travel apps and books by seeing how they do with places I know. This one is easy to use and the information seems to be more or less accurate.
Version 5.6 2011-06-25 5
Every time we take a vacation Tripadvisor is my go to site for all my info. The apps are great, they've made lots of great improvements since I first started using them. Keep up the good work!
Version 5.92 2012-02-25 5
This app does it all for me when it comes to travel needs. Quick, efficient and has all the info I need. It has never steered me wrong! It is A#1 in my playbook!
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
My only request is a search by hotel name option. As occasional TA users, both my wife and I find it reliable and traveler friendly. Now on my iP4S it's convenient too.
Version 6.6 2012-12-21 5
Tripadvisor has always been of great help in planning my overseas adventures. To have an app for my iPad will prove even more helpful as I carry my iPad with me wherever I travel.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-23 5
As good and better than desktop version. Not a huge social media travel review user but becoming one for travel because of TripAdvisor.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5
Just spent 18$ on my booking! Use "hotel tonight" and when sign up use promo: hoteltonight2
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 4
I love the app and it's very easy to use. I wish you could choose to stay logged in and It would be better if you could do a lookup by location and pick from places on the map, similar to the way Yelp and Urbanspoon work.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-24 5
I use the site extensively for planning trips like the one we took to Hawaii. It helped us pick our hotel and the restaurants we ate at and the excursion we did.
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5
I waited too long and actually did a 11,000 mile road trip without it.  I will use it for my europe trip next fall for sure.  There is too much fantastic information that I will not live without.
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 5
You get a really good idea of places to see, where to eat and stay. Shuffle through the good and bad, comparing your tastes with that of others. Love how the map feature ties in with the places. Great App!
Version 6.1 2012-05-08 3
Many establishments are correcting their issues upon bad reviews
But still paying the negative impact long ago as tripadvisor keep reviews for years, it should offer option to remove reviews after 1 year or after specific issues have been corrected
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 4
It is a great app for traveling or when you are out of ideas for things to do.  Some places are not being properly displayed on the maps... right address is displayed but incorrectly positioned on the map.
Version 5.6 2011-05-18 5
Especially when you're clueless about where to start.   The up-to-date reviews are invaluable.  If you're travel plan is flexible it's so easy to search for the lowest fares.
Version 5.6 2011-06-09 5
Love the app, especially the range of reviewers.  We used Yelp alone, until we happened to be on vacation and found Trip Advisor to have a more diverse range of reviewers.
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
This app really helps me when I am planning a trip or on a trip looking for options and/or information. This is the first place I go, and usually the last place I need to go to.
Version 6.6 2012-10-29 5
I've found my fellow travelers' opinions more valuable than any commercially available travel guide. Highly recommended
Version 6.6 2012-11-27 5
This app is wonderful, and as a business traveler I frequently check Tripadvisor for hotel/restaurant recommendations. I have found the reviews to be very helpful!
Version 5.8 2011-08-22 4
I love this app and TripAdvisor in general!  Never failed me or my family so far whenever we go for our vacations or weekend getaway!  Easy to use especially in the iPad, posted photos are bigger and more easy to navigate.  Thumbs up!
Version 6.6 2013-01-16 5
I am on a Backpacking journey around Asia and I have been using trip advisor / and the offline app for most of the planing and I love every thing about these apps
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-21 5
This app is really helpful to get an idea of a place before you go I love it even though its other people's opinions. Some of us think the same more than we realize.
Version 8.3 2013-12-28 4
Great for recommendations on restaurants, attractions, and tours, etc.  I can use the app on the go but I feel like the computer version is better; sometimes I can't do everything with just the app.
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 5
I just added this app last night, and I love it already!  I can always count on the Trip Advisor reviews, and this app makes it easier than ever to access them.
Version 5.92 2012-01-24 5
Easy to use, up to date and a great travel companion. Also people writing reviews are in my opinion honest and devoted to write an objective opinion. Highly recommend using tripadvisor.
Version 6.6 2013-02-08 4
A lot of times the pictures take a long time to load, other than that, it's a really good app. I'm using wifi and they fail to load or load slow, I use 3G and they load fast, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?
Version 5.6 2011-06-20 5
This is the one and only application to have on vacation.  Forget the hotel maps and suggestions...this app is always the number one way to plan your day!
Version 6.6 2013-01-05 5
We use this app whenever we travel or when planning a trip. Would be lost without the helpful reviews when deciding on hotels, restaurants and motor coach resorts.
Version 8.2 2013-12-12 5
I love trip advisor they give precise and helpful reviews that go over information that's needed when your going to a resort and country you don't know.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
Easy to use and indispensable when planning a trip. Love the satellite view feature. I have been a long time user on the Internet but this iPad app is even more amazing! Highly recommend!
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
The ease of browsing Trip Advisor on this app is excellent.  This app features plenty of reviews, addresses, pictures and links to make planning a trip easy.
Version 5.6 2011-08-16 5
As long as people participate rating and writing fair and objective reviews the app will provide better info.
The app is well built, solid and reliable.
Version 6.4 2012-09-09 5
Traveling from VA to ME and it kept me aware of traffic jams, police and ways around problem areas.  It also helps the passenger entertain his/her self!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-11 5
I love having trip advisor on my iPhone and iPad. Just discovered the nifty point me there feature. Awesome for us directionally challenged folks.
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
More intuitive and useful than the website. Wonderfully organized and easy to use. Jump between destinations things to do hotels and flight information in a snap.
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
We travel often and this app has been a great help to us. Thanks to it we have found some excellent hotels and restaurants that we may otherwise have overlooked.
Version 5.6 2011-08-20 5
I depend on the honest reviews of others through TripAdvisor.  This app helps me to make informed decisions and the search and filter functions are very useful.
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
I use the app to plan my vacations to the Ukraine and elsewhere. The advice of fellow travelers is extremely useful and greatly appreciated. I am glad to have it and use it quite a bit.
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 3
I don't consider myself a big "shopper" but when I travel, I always want a day to peruse local shops. Unique boutiques give you insight to the community as a whole. Who lives here, who buys here, what makes this area unique? Why doesn't trip advisor consider shopping an event worthy of ranking or featuring?
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-13 4
The update took away a few of the functions from the app I really enjoyed.  For example it was a summary of all the major points of the reviews. Loved it. Made things easier. But it's all still good.
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
Seeing the different opinions and comment trends over time is really helpful when choosing a hotel in city that is not familiar.  People are very honest.
Version 8.5 2014-04-01 5
The best app/site available for ratings of restaurants, hotels & attractions.  My primary resource for such things, especially when traveling.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
I am planning a trip to New York and have spent weeks researching and downloading apps. This is by far the best overall resource and the advice from members is invaluable.
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 4
I've just began using recently for work and personal travel.  I like it so far.  It is helpful to find local hotels, restaurants and activities. I am not certain how inclusive it is.  Seems like it is.  I will continue to use this utility.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-10 5
The reason I really like this app is that real people like me actually use the app and write the review. Hard to blow smoke with so many of us using it now.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 5
It's great having this info on my iPhone. I'm trying to plan a trip to Europe at the same time I'm really busy at work. Just 5 minutes of Trip Advisor is actually really useful.
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
This is such a handy app, at home, but especially traveling. I'll use it often. I've learned the value and now try to leave reviews myself, to help the next person.
Version 5.9 2011-12-13 5
They both have pluses. Enjoy the convenience and ease of the app with one hand, but to dig a little deeper with more reviews, don't stop referring to your web based version too.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
I love his app because it helps me make informed decisions as well as help others. I always use this when I travel and I love writing reviews for trip advisor.
Version 6.6 2013-01-13 5
This site is always a "go too" whenever and wherever I travel. I can always get helpful hints on hotels and what to see when we are in a new town. The app is easy to use and navigate.
Version 5.8 2011-09-21 5
This is a very easy to use app that has yet to disappoint us on our travels. We refer to the reviews before we decide on lodging and dining.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
It's great to be able to see user submitted photos of hotels, but the app has some annoying quirks with the search functionality, maps, etc.  it is helpful to use it along side some other trip planning apps.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-12 5
Just left one of the most memorable weddings ever!! It was held at The Barn in Leavenworth,KS.  If you are looking to get hitched....check out this facility as it is a gem!!!!!
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 5
Use it all the time while traveling, never disappointed, has improved quality of traveling tremendously.
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
I've only been using it about an hour but I like it better than the site. The speed is great and it's much easier to browse hotels than on the website. Great job!
Version 5.93 2012-02-29 5
After driving 14 hours we had to find a place to crash.  This app was great!  I was able to find a hotel one exit away from where we were and got a great rate!  We won't leave home without it!
Version 5.93 2012-03-07 5
This is an excellent very easy to use app.  Offers everything from hundreds of resort photos from real people not the advertising agency, reviews and rates and packages .
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
I've used this app for all of my planning. It has great guest reviews and pictures. Easy to use and navigate through. All the information you need in on place.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 5
I don't have a personal assistant but  my work requires a fair amount of travel.  This app makes me feel like I have an assistant taking care of my travel plans!  Love it.
Version 5.8 2011-09-05 5
This app is very handy whether you're new to a city or are a local. User feedback is of a quality that seems a little better than other sites I've used so it's been really helpful.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 4
I used this app to book a whole vacation without even going into a separate browser.
It's got a nice layout and let's you do everything you want including airfare.
I wish there was more pictures of the resorts, but that's up to users to upload I guess.
Version 5.8 2011-09-02 5
I luv trip advisor. Saves me a lot of research when planning my trips. I haven't checked to see if it has info on foreign countries or cruises. Now that woul give it a 10 in my book.
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 5
Trip Advisor is a must when looking at your travel options and destinations.  Easy to use, informative and covers all travel topics.
Version 6.4 2012-08-18 5
I'm planning to go to London with a friend and this app I helping me a tons love it now I know I will sleep at a wonderful hotel the flight, and everything. Everyone needs this app to help them travel
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
I have used Trip Advisor for several years. Never go anywhere without consulting Trip Advisor reviews. I've not been steered wrong yet
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 3
This app even if you select view all saves still forces you to only see saves for one location at a time. I like Google + Local saves option much better. Outside of the saves and lack of professional reviews (I hate relying on user reviews) this is the most useful travel review app.
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 5
Trip Advisor is the Go-To place for me when in search of any information.  Wether on a trip or at home for a special occasion restaurant.  A search you can trust.
Version 6.5 2012-09-23 5
Without fail I find great restaurants and pet friendly hotels in seconds.  I don't have to eat in a franchise and can enjoy meeting locals when I am on the road.
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 5
Love using this app, my wife and I have used it for every trip we plan to get very useful information about potential locales and hotels we're looking into.
Version 5.6 2011-07-04 5
So far Trip Advisor has been my one stop shop for researching locations, hotels, etc. I am really enjoying reading the reviews and have found the contributors pretty accurate!
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
No matter where we travel to, I count on this app for tours, eats and more. I get all my information in one place instead of visiting multiple websites. Love it and very accurate.
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 5
More than 4 years of Tripadvisor at our side! Hiking,biking,Hotel stays and scrumptious eats have been at our fingertips. There is NO OTHER app or site we trust more. Thank you Tripadvisor!
Version 6.1 2012-04-18 5
Outstanding & timely info.  We use and share what we find on this site with friends on a regular basis.  Keep working to make it as user friendly as possible.
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 5
TA is great site to find out the info about dining, hotel, all other thing you need when you are on the go. 

Highly Recomended & widely used by me & other. You will love it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-07 5
This is a great app to use while traveling.  I pay attention to the reviews.  I also write reviews when I'm on the road so others can share my experiences.
Version 5.6 2011-05-19 5
Works better than the website, very intuitive and incredibly easy to use. Love the map views and the entire format of the app. Use it, love it. Trip advisor will never let you down :)
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
This app is everything you need or would expect if you went to their website: find new places, read reviews, see pictures, and write reviews. Great app!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-14 5
Glad I have this app to shared my experience and also read reviews of others! Hotel and dining reviews have been extremely helpful!
Version 6.3 2012-07-31 5
This is an excellent source for finding information on places you are thinking or planning on visiting.  Most of the review give a prettty acurate review of the facility  .
Version 6.3 2012-10-18 5
I never travel without using this app. The suggestions and reviews make all the difference in planning a great trip.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-22 5
We are planning a trip to New York.  We have never been here before and we find this app very useful.  Photos, Map and reviews are what we looked at the most.  Thank you!
Version 5.92 2012-01-29 5
Intuitive, easy to use app.  If you are going anywhere that you are unfamiliar with or just checking things out locally this app gets you answers right away
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
Protect yourself, time, & money by using this app.  Do your research and don't be disappointed.  The near me now feature is not always accurate.  Great app.
Version 6.6 2013-01-17 5
Trip Advisor is a great service and they have produced a great iPad app to go with it. As a pro pilot, I use it all the time for hotel selection and things to do around the world.
Version 8.1 2013-11-11 5
Just like American Express, don't plan a trip without consulting this app. Invaluable information.
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
Could find here other guides do not show. What to do, where to go near your location, plus the reviews, simply awesome. Thanks for creating this application.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
This is so handy. I never thought they had one like this app. I like it showing how many miles you are from the place. I would recommend it for anybody.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
This app is great! I like the fact that I can map around a particular area to see what's there. I just did trips to 2 new areas that I wouldn't have considered if not for this app.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
I plan all of my vacations from my iPhone now. Or, when I'm traveling, I use it as a quick reference for reliable restaurants or last minute hotels.
Version 7.1 2013-07-16 5
This is my favorite travel app. We have used it for restaurants and site seeing. We've found numerous restaurants and "things to so" thanks to tripadvisor. Invaluable!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-26 4
It's a very good app with integration with services like hotel reservations and air tickets. 

Sometimes the UI doesn't seem to respond to touch screen and can be resolved using the option icon above.
This is only a minor problem!
Version 5.8 2011-10-28 4
Used this app to prepare for and during a recent NY City trip.  Mostly worked well for the things we did and some food options.  My wife loves it, mostly because the reviews seem accurate to our experiences.
Version 5.9 2011-11-08 5
I check in with Trip Advisor before trips or meals mainly because the reviews are spot on.  I have a high trust factor with TA and rely on the data found there.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 4
Be sure to call first, some restaurants named were no longer in business. 
Version 5.92 2012-01-20 5
This is a great app to use to plan trips. Before I travel I look over the restaurant reviews and save the ones that look interesting. Then when I get to the city I'm prepared to ask the locals their opinions, too.
Version 5.3 2011-07-28 5
Great app better network of opinions. When I don't check a review and have issues, I go back after the visit and read the reviews to find they did not lie. Well done.
Version 5.8 2012-01-14 5
Rarely steered wrong with Trip Advisor.  Love this app for finding a good restaurant close by when we travel.  We travel a lot and this is my go-to app when in a new place.
Version 6.6 2013-02-23 4
It was easy to look for flights and hotels, comparing side by side. I booked a flight through it. The one thing I would fix is that it loses your results after you browse around. Wish it could remember my last search.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-19 5
Easy to search site for places to go,  where to eat, and things to do whether looking for something local or something further away.
Version 5.8 2011-09-16 5
Can't travel without this app. We have found some really neat places to stay by searching thru this app. Helps eliminate bad experiences of cheesy hotels too!
Version 6.1 2012-04-03 4
I really like this app,have used it a few times now and have always found useful info on the places that I am in. Would definitely download and give it a try next time your away or even think about going away.
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 5
Tripadvisor has always been my "travel bible" & I've never been let down. I am thrilled to have access on my iPhone through this very handy app !!! I give it a 5 star rating !
Version 6.6 2013-01-03 5
I really like the app mainly because of the reviews. Talking to my friend who owns a couple hotels, trip adviser is the main app they follow for feedback on reviews.
Version 8.1 2013-11-07 5
If not for this app we wouldn't have found Evening Shade Inn in Eureka Springs, AR where we married and honeymooned. Also, it has led me to some great hometown places that I didn't know existed.
Version 5.9 2011-11-21 5
Looking forward to our next trip to Istanbul, gathering all useful info and restaurants through my new trip advisor app. A must for travelers!
Version 6.1 2012-04-16 5
We have discovered lots of great hotels and restaurants with this app. Highly recommended. I wouldnt plan a trip without it.
Version 6.1 2012-05-26 4
So far I'm enjoying the ease of use of this app. It would be nice if all of your account management was available instead of having to login to the website, but I'm sure future versions will move more over to the app.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 5
I use to never do this type thing but I write my reviews while I am in the establishment if at all possible. And I have shown my review to some owners and managers from my table.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 4
My first time using Trip Advisor... I liked it but there were some things that were confusing such as sometimes there seems to be an option to filter by distance and sometimes not.  I'll definitely use it again, though.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-21 5
This app is wonderful. Everyone has their opinion but there's always pictures to back up the claims, good or bad. I don't travel without Tripadvisor
Version 5.7 2011-08-17 5
I use Trip Advisor all the time on my home laptop.  Having the convenience of having this app on my iPad is fantastic.  I always have my iPad with me, not so my laptop which stays home.
Version 5.8 2011-11-01 5
I use the website all the time and love the iPad app. It works perfectly and great for when I travel and want to find out what is around me.
Version 6.0 2012-03-25 5
Great app! Use it all the time to check out restaurants & attractions wherever we go! Best to find out from actual users rather than the establishments whether a place is actually good or fun.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 3
The app is easy and intuitive to navigate, and I like it, save for a few drawbacks:

Photos don't link back to their reviews, and almost every time I switch to another app then back, the app does not keep my history but puts me on the main search page.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
First used this app when I traveled to a resort area. Very helpful in scouting out top eateries, accomadations, attractions. I love it! Helps prevent expensive time wasting mistakes.
Version 8.5 2014-03-06 3
When using this app throughout the world, it is often frustrating to use the app because there is little or no internet. The database of addresses do not necessarily correctly map to locations in many places. Otherwise a very useful tool.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 4
Tripadvisor is a good resource with honest reviews from folks. This app is super helpful as the search for locations is fast with good autocomplete and easy access to photos of the lodging. A must have app for your vacation planning.
Version 6.1 2012-04-18 4
Since I don't always get things lined up in advance, trip advisor makes it easy to know and go almost immediately.  That is so, so helpful.
It's also good to be able to have the flexibility to re-plan things when the need arises.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 3
I much prefer the iPhone app to the iPad so that I can see things in list form rather than on the map and then have to try to sort everything out. I like the map as an option but not as default. Also, the rankings differ from the full version online.....very misleading to a potential visitor of a place!
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
Easy, simple smooth and perfect when you just need to tell someone about your experience! I always know my app is ready to either let me vent or praise!
Version 8.3 2013-12-27 5
Just downloaded trip-advisor mobile App and submitted my first review. It's very cool! I love Trip Advisor and make most of my choices based on Trip-advisor reviews !!
Version 5.5 2011-05-21 5
I have been traveling in Asia for about a year and Trip Advisor is an essential tool to find good accommodations at a reasonable rate.  I recommend it for any traveller.  The iPad app works great too!
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
Been doing a lot of traveling thus summer, wish I would have found this app sooner. Works great and thankful fir all the reviews folks leave behind!
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
I use this for every trip our family takes. Makes it easy to weed out the overpriced touristy spots and focus on the best places to visit and eat at the top restaurants.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-18 5
I wouldn't even CONSIDER booking a hotel room without consulting this amazing app.  No where is there so much info. And photos of where you are considering to stay.
Version 5.6 2011-06-11 5
Love having a map of the area next to the info on loding, restaurants & attractions.  Can't imagine planning another getaway without it, let alone not having it as a travel guide once I arrive!
Version 5.8 2011-11-27 5
I have been using TripAdvisor for years, and this app is exactly the quality and service level I would expect from this site. Great job!
Version 6.1 2012-05-10 2
Now provides only a single listing in "map" view which is much less use-friendly.  Could be a great restaurant or hotel next door, but now must use 3rd party mapping (Google maps or Mapquest) in addition to this app.
Previously, you could view many listing locations at same time on map view.  A step backwards!
Version 6.6 2013-04-20 5
Easy to use on the iPad or iPhone for traveling and quick searches for restaurants. For trip planning its better to log in on a computer to see the full application.
Version 5.8 2011-08-17 5
TripAdvisor provides an excellent interactive approach to trip planning and research.  Utilizing the iPad app makes the process incredibly easy and productive.
Version 5.3 2011-08-26 5
Trip advisor has brought me to sooooo many places to eat in far away towns. Could not do without it. The details and navigating the app function well.
Version 5.8 2011-10-14 5
Helpful to find things in a country where I am unfamiliar with the language. Maps are useful, kept us from getting lost after a long day driving!
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
I have been using this app for few months now. It has become my first choice for any vacation/sight-seeing planning. Keep up the good work guys!
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 5
Where is the jewel in Ocho Rios Jamaica? Maybe the query isn't picking it up because it didn't have a real address?!?! Please fix so i can continue reading 5 star reviews :)
Version 6.4 2012-08-27 4
I think this is a great travel app that uses very well the spaceprovidedby the ipad.
Still... Would begreat to be able to book hotels and restaurants directly from here, without moving to other websites or apps
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 5
This tool comes handy when planning a trip. It does cover most of the traveler's concerns and offers some good ideas for sites to see and things to do while away.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-03 5
It keeps getting better and better...  Just used it for a trip out West to some remote locations and it was a big help, both for dining, lodging and attractions.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-13 5
This app has great information, integrates it well with Maps, and gives decent search options.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 4
Works great and looks terrific on my iPad. Would have given 5 stars if there was some way to minimize the map. Maybe I just haven't figured it out yet, but it annoys me that I can't get rid of the map when I'm just trying to read reviews.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 5
I have always regretted it when I travel and don't check out it out on the "Trip." The reviews always give me something to base my decisions on.
Version 5.6 2011-07-09 5
Just booking a trip and decided to use my app. So far so good, easy to use and lots of helpful reviews. Will definitely use for every trip! What's not to like!
Version 5.92 2012-02-07 5
I enjoy traveling to different cities around the nation and the trip advisor app is perfect for getting insight knowledge on the best places to go and not waste time and money getting suckered into a TOURIST TRAP!
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Used tripadvisor app for the first time while planning my last trip. Incredible. Trip was perfect. So easy to use. Better than the website in my opinion.
Version 4.0 2009-12-06 5
We just got back from a 2 week trip through Italy.  Was able to get wifi here and there.  We used This app alot to find some great meals while we traveled around.
Version 5.5 2011-09-23 4
Also hard to provide feedback and most of the time goes to a black hole. 
BUT, what other app is out there that will give you a good list to brainstorm? Get it.
Version 5.8 2011-11-01 5
I use TripAdvisor often to plan trips and tell others about gems unearthed.  You should have this app loaded if you travel.
Version 6.6 2012-12-30 5
I love this app.  It has been very useful in planing my trip itineraries!  It is extremely useful to have actual reviews from people who have been to the locations.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 2
There are no links to original websites for hotels.  I really hate being locked into one vendor's version of truth (and lack of details).  Please add links (or make them more obvious if I overlooked them) to original websites for all items since your app can't possibly include everything the original site can provide.
Version 8.5 2014-03-19 5
Never again do I have an excuse. The reviews help me make good decisions whether traveling with the family or on business.
Version 5.8 2011-08-17 4
Found the app while searching online on Trip Adviser, downloaded the app and it has been open on my iPhone and iPad2 all week while on vacation.  We have found good restaurants and saved time as well.  Good find!
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
Since I don't travel but once a quarter or so, the updates and improvements are often a nice surprise when I open the app after not using it for awhile.
Version 5.93 2012-03-17 5
I used to check and rely on yelp all the time. But last time I travelled to Cancun tripadvisor saved me! If you are traveling this is the app you need. What would I have done without it
Version 5.8 2011-10-12 5
I have used Trip Advisor on my last two vacations and I will never use another!  This app has everything I need to help me make my choices!
Version 6.1 2012-06-19 5
I can't say enough great things about this app! I use it constantly at home in the USA and in Europe. Last summer we traveled through Italy with the help of Trip Advisor. It's the app I use most!
Version 6.6 2012-10-10 5
I did try it in my trip in Istanbul, it was unbelievable it sometime looks like you don't need to meet or asking any one more cuz of this app it's really full app
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
Great product for hotel nerds like myself. Fun to look up random hotels around the globe and read the commentary. The revamped pictures section is a huge help!
Version 8.5 2014-03-02 5
You are not steered wrong in using this site to find precisely what you are looking for in a place to eat or sleep.  Candid reviews that you can trust.
Version 8.5 2014-03-12 5
I love giving feedback on different establishments. It is a great way for a business to improve, and for consumers to get ideas when traveling or locally.
Version 5.92 2012-01-17 4
I was using this app at the beginning of 2011 while traveling in Europe. It was quite good and very informative. However, once it gave me the wrong address of the hotel, and I nearly missed it.. Now I prefer to use Google Maps instead.
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 5
Love this app.  Let's you tell others about your experience and also let's me find out what to expect at a destination.  Very helpful when planning a trip.
Version 6.6 2013-04-03 5
The ratings from users are so helpful.  Love the mapping part too. Just needs to work with iMacs or another map program to get from point to point
Version 6.0 2012-03-15 4
The update has really made this app much more useable, in my estimation.  I really like how easy it it to use the 'nearby' feature, but I ESPECIALLY like that you can now go straight to the business' website from within the app.  Much better!
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 4
So far I am enjoying this app. Just installed yesterday and have gotten lots of additional info regarding our upcoming trip to Vancouver Island and Torfino and Vancouver. Glad I installed it, just for the reviews! It has helped with hotel choices.
Version 6.6 2012-09-29 2
I like TripAdvisor, and cherish the iPhone app for handy, reliable info when traveling.  Just started using the iPad app tonight, and am quite disappointed.  Searching by name or geographic proximity is unreliable, entering a review takes 3 screens, and gives the impression of 'incompleteness'.  Big screen apps aren't always better....
Version 5.9 2011-12-24 5
This app has improved my travel and given me essential info when I needed it most. Lots of users gives me more accurate ratings, too.
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 4
This is a great app and I really like the quick glance at the 1-5 radio type buttons for ratings. However, Yelp also has a great App and I am split on which one I prefer but find myself using Yelp more often.
Version 6.6 2012-11-28 5
When traveling anytime anywhere, all I have to do is open one app and there it all is. Easy to add, easy to modify. My go-to travel app.
Version 5.8 2011-10-25 5
Just downloaded this app and am thrilled with it. Extremely easy to navigate and all the information I've come to expect from TripAdvisor.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-27 5
Always use Trip Advisor. Since it is so reliable, family and friends now assign me the task of selecting where to go or what to do.  It makes me look like I'm smart.
Version 6.5 2012-09-13 5
Great app. I use it all the time before I go on a vacation. I love the fact that I get to read what other travelers have to say about their experiences. Must download.
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
This app gives viewers information about things to do, stay, eat, etc. making it a must use app if one does a lot of traveling. Interesting info.
Version 6.0 2012-03-25 5
We use this app all the time to make choices from finding small parks and getaways to major vacations.
You can't go wrong, a must have for any traveller.
Version 6.2 2012-07-02 5
For the past few months I've been making an effort to write a review a day about the different places I go.  Not having to wait until I get home is the absolute BEST!!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 5
We are members and use this app to plan and research our trips. We rate our destinations and enjoy the reviews written by others and find them helpful
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
We have been planning a vacation, and now it is 2 days away! In 5 weeks of planning I haven't found half as much information as I have on this app!!!
Version 5.8 2011-08-31 5
Love this app! So easy to use.  You can search by area using the map and easily read reviews, go to street view or book a hotel.
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
Trip advisor is an excellent resource when I'm on the road.   I use it daily for recommendations regarding lodging and restaurants that for the most part have been dead on.
Version 5.9 2011-12-06 5
This app is great. Allows me to purchase ticked leaving from the U.S and also leaving international. It also gives me things to do while I'm on vacation. Its worth the download.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-09 5
I have tried its info a couple of times and it always turns out very reliable. Great service with this app. Just give it a try.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-27 5
Very easy to use! It also expends the search to other websites to assure the best price. I have used it for many times  and very happy with each result!
Version 8.2 2013-12-14 5
I used this at home to find new lace to try as well as seeing how my favorites are.  I travel for work both domestic and international  and it hasn't let me down yet.
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 5
I've been a fan of TripAdvisor for a long time and to have the app with you anywhere you go is fabulous. It's easy to navigate and always up to date. It's a must have if you do any traveling at all.
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
The app is even more user friendly than the website in terms of looking at pics and using the map. A must for travel research.
Version 5.8 2011-10-23 5
A must have app/website for traveling and finding whats good. Either solo,  with friends, or with the family I've found the reviews dead on, and the software is easy to use.
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 5
Don't leave home without it! Using 3G network in the car found a great restaurant in Maine I never would have found any other way. Met a friend there for dinner and was a star for finding it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
So far so good. Limitations are only what people have not reported on. This app has nothing but upside potential. Already found things to do (and not do) based on others recommendations.
Version 6.1 2012-04-22 5
A must have!  We always check it before we do anything!  Use it before make any reservations and get real info from real customer!!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-10 3
Trip Advisor mobile is a bad implementation.   The mobile site won't let me sign in using my Facebook account and the mobile app is only good for searching-I can not access any of my account data. Therefore I cannot access my trips or inbox.
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
I use trip advisor to know where to go a d where to avoid.  However I do not take it as gospel truth, but as a reference allowing me to make an informed decision as to where to go, where to eat and what o see.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
Checking Trip Advisor before venturing out can make the best of your experience. Genuine people with genuine comments!
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 5
Definitely the best app for travelers. You have the options you need when choosing a place to stay and the ratings are pretty reliable. Glad I chose it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-18 3

Version 8.3.1 2014-01-26 3
Very basic and friendly app, but needs some work done. Still prefer to use the main website. The app will occasionally close no matter what mobile device it's used on and takes a while to start up. Overall, I'm sure it will get better with time.
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
I bought a handful of apps for my trip to Oahu that were supposed to be specific to Hawaii.  All of them pale in comparison to TripAdvisor.  TripAdvisor has the best coverage and best advice.
Version 5.8 2011-11-11 5
While no replacement for the full website, this is a super useful app.  Trip Advisor is my first destination for any travel planning. Highly recommend.
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
I spent nearly 3 weeks traveling from Rome to southern Italy and back - stayed at 9 B&Bs booked through this app, and it was flawless. I love it!
Version 6.2 2012-06-20 5
This app is great!  Helped me plan a well desired vacation on short notice. Please keep up the great job in updating the app. It has everything you need to plan that needed getaway.
Version 6.6 2013-04-11 1
When I first downloaded TripAdvisor to my iPad about a year ago it functioned great. But now, after recent updates, it's user friendliness and functionality has gone down. It shuts down a lot. It says I'm not connected to the Internet when I am. And this is just to name a few issues. I will always use TripAdvisor, but it's unfortunate that my favorite devise to access it, no longer works as well as it use to.
Version 5.8 2011-10-26 5
This was the best experience our driver Phil was very knowledgable and very considerate he took photos of us at the famous sites and told detailed stories absolutely FAB
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-24 5
We just did a 4000 mile roadtrip to and from California, and really got a lot of use from this app.. We stayed at very nice hotels and ate at some nice places that I wouldn't normally visit.

Super application!!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 5
We were on a road trip from Houston Texas to the Grand Canyon and Trip advisor never let us down, finding great restaurants and things to do that we never would have found on our own.
Version 5.92 2012-03-09 5
I love this app! We travel a lot and while some people love to complain of you read a good 5-7 reviews per hotel you will see its worth listening to people on trip advisor.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I find this site better than Yelp in finding recommendation for restaurants, hotels, and attraction nearby. Would highly recommend relying on this site...
Version 6.6 2012-10-28 5
Our trips are so much more enjoyable because we can get the information we need ahead of time. I don't know how we ever did without it.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5
I am still here in Florence after Rome. All the forum advisors and reviews that I read and advises from Donna about Rome were a HUGE help. Thk u and will definitely use tripadvisor for next trip!
Version 5.92 2012-01-19 5
I use it all the time even around my home I have found fun things to do when I have been out of town, and great places to eat right down the street from me...a must have
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
When I travel I have come to rely on reviews from Trip Advisor whether it is restaurants or lodging. I don't know how I traveled before without the great information.
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
I've always enjoyed the TripAdvisor website and now I have a handy app that lets me access all that information from the convenience of my iPhone. This is great!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-04 5
I've been using this app during my vacation and it's been incredibly handy for finding nearby restaurants. Great app!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
I have been using this app for a while now. It has been extremely helpful and I have enjoyed writing as well reading reviews.
Version 5.7 2011-07-06 5
Our family is always on the go and this is the greatest app to help us on our way. Weather it's hotels or food or something to do in between games this app points us in the right direction.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Works like a dream every time. Loads quickly, and very uncluttered yet comprehensive interface.
Version 5.9 2011-11-22 5
Have used it numerous times and will continue to use. It's a must to check this app before setting sail on your journey.
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 5
Nice app.  Clear, well organized and easy to use.
Works the way you expect it to and gets to the information you want to know quickly.
Version 6.6 2012-10-16 5
Love it for finding local food establishments when traveling.  We have used it on both coasts and states in between with great results.
Version 6.6 2013-01-29 4
I love trip advisor and the app is very easy to use. However within the last couple of days I've been getting lots of error messages when trying to search for flights.
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
I used this app several times while we were on vacation to find good local restaurants and other places, and for help on what to avoid.  Very useful.
Version 8.0 2013-10-08 4
I use TA as my source to find the best restaurants and hotels when I travel. The community contributing to TA is reliable and rather descriptive which helps make decisions. You gotta love travel technology!
Version 5.3 2011-04-25 5
Great app, easy to use, lots of info - for some reason I like the app more than the website. I enjoy reading reviews and especially the follow-up responses from hotel managers.
Version 5.6 2011-05-19 4
This is one of those rare apps that isn't used every day but is hugely useful when you want it. Well organized and written it gives you the info you're used to from the wonderful Tripadvisor. There truly is no substitute (sorry Porsche).
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
One of the best apps I have used so far.  Quickly provides all the information in a easy layout on many popular vacation destinations! Love it!
Version 6.6 2013-01-18 4
TrapAdvisor is my go to app when I want to go somewhere.  Reviews and ratings have assisted me in seeking out places to stay, dine, and visit. Once, a negative review of a cruise made me book that cruise line as the negatives were positives for me.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Great application if you are planning a trip. I read the reviews every day to make sure my trip will be enjoyable. Highly recommend.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 5
I absolutely love trip advisor, and use it anytime I travel. It's simple and incredibly helpful with picking where to eat and what to do on vacation. A must-have app.
Version 5.8 2011-08-27 5
Very nice app. Functions well with out crashing and most of the hotel reviews are spot on. I usually try to stay at a hotel that is within the top 10 if my budget allows.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
If you love traveling you shouldn't go anywhere without this app. Sometimes I can't find a place that I know is on the website. Overall, it's great :)
Version 5.5 2011-05-05 5
I love this app! Have been to Washington DC and Lisbon recently and have had amazing recommendations from fellow travelers! App is better than website because it knows where you are!
Version 5.4 2011-08-16 5
We love this ap and have added it to all of our mobile devices. It has proved accurate for everything from local fare to out of state attractions.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Vey useful app. Now I mostly use this app for trip wif my bf n his families. We've use this app for information from as close as to San Francisco to as far as Canada, vancouver!
Version 6.2 2012-06-14 3
Restaurants are missing from the listings and the way the map works is funky - I would suggest it should work more smoothly an intuitively - or just drop the Bing Map and go with Google.
The TripAdvisor service is awesome, I love it - the app just needs some work.
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
Found a great hotel in Milan. Found great restaurants in Milan. While walking around found a wonderful cafe, and better yet, avoided the bad one! Awesome app!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-22 5
I have written a couple of reviews with it and it is easy to use.
For hard to find places it takes a little more effort, still  easy to use.
Version 6.1 2012-06-13 5
Trip Advisor has not failed me yet!  I love the candid feedback and rely on the site to find the best food options when traveling. Thumbs up!
Version 6.2 2012-06-15 4
Good app but it seems to be missing a lot of restaurants and other places in a number of central eastern European capitol cities. Too bad it doesn't allow users to input new places that aren't yet listed in their system.
Version 6.0 2012-08-30 5
I travel quite a bit and I find this app very useful. Unfortunately, I cannot choose the hotels I stay at for business but at least I know what to expect.
Version 6.6 2013-01-30 5
I really like this app. It's simple and easy to use. Gives you just the right amount of information you'd need when planning a trip. Thanks!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
I don't book any travel without checking this app.
Version 5.5 2011-05-12 2
I like the full website rather than the app. Why doesn't it give you any options or suggestions of destinations in the case the someone doesn't know the location they would like to travel to? There's only the option of entering a name of a city or "near me now". Well, if I don't know where i'd like to vacation to and i don't plan on traveling near my home location then this app is useless.
Version 5.9 2011-11-22 5
I find TA to be an invaluable source of information for all travel. Love that travelers can share opinions and help guide one another out here in the big world of travel options.
Version 6.1 2012-04-17 5
My wife and I are researching tours to Italy. We have checked out hotels listed in travel booklets and found tripadviser to be very helpful. Keep up the fine job!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-17 5
We never do anything on a trip without first checking things on Tripadvisor! I love having this app so I can keep my favorite review site with me at all times!
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
Whenever I'm looking to travel, I always look at TripAdvisor to get a feel for hotels in the city. I like the real reviews and pictures taken by real people! 
This app is great and works pretty seamlessly too!
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 4
The app doesn't tell you every hotel around you. We passed several to get to the one that was nearest to us. However the app did show me everything I needed to know about the hotel, food by it, and things to do around it. We knew where to avoid., so thank you!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-01 5
Worked just fine for us in our 3 week trip to Europe.  Helped us find good food and lodging the only time we got a bad meal was when we didn't use it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-02 5
I love this app, what I find especially useful is being able to see actual ratings from different patrons
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5
Since trip advisor is recognized as the most common site for traveling, this app makes trip planning so much easier.
Version 8.5 2014-03-29 5
Before I make any reservations or plan any trip I ALWAYS ALWAYS check with TripAdvisor. They are the first step in the process.  Thank you TripAdvisor !!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
I've used it to find local restaurants and to plan trips. It works great and makes good recommendations. I only wish it could or I knew how to export my saved info.
Version 6.6 2013-02-14 5
This is a great app. For traveling on the go.  It gives you a great idea of what you're in for. Very nice to know all about places before you get there.
Version 6.6 2013-04-20 5
On vacation with the family and was able to find things to do very easily using the Trip Advisor app as my only resource.
Version 8.4 2014-02-03 5
We use this app all the time when traveling or trying new places and restaurants in our area. Reviews are pretty spot on most of the time.
Version 5.92 2012-01-19 5
Anytime I am planning a trip or need a review of a restaurant, hotel, cities, etc...I always check Trip Advisor.  It is the absolute best site.  They always come through with honest criticisms.
Version 6.6 2012-11-18 5
I love using Trip Advisor!  Have planned many trips using hotels, restaurants and excursions off the advice of my peeps on trip finder and have NEVER been disappointed!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
Easy to find places near you and see reviews. I like the saves button. I wish it would save the My saves with a user account and remember from iPhone to iPad.
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 5
Right in line with the site. You can check on many hotels and restaurants and also read reviews. Tremendously helpful!
Version 8.3 2013-12-29 4
Great app for searching, I just wish reviewing my reviews was as seamless as the website.

All in all, I use TripAdvisor and Yelp concurrently, but trust TripAdvisor over Yelp because of the more dedicated users.
Version 5.92 2012-01-29 5
I love the Trip Advisor app!  It is my "go to" app for all things to see, eat & do in Italy.  Haven't tried it for other countries yet, but can't imagine why it wouldn't be as wonderful.  5 stars from me!
Version 6.0 2012-03-20 5
Having tried many "restaurant locator" apps,  Trip Advisor remains a favorite.  Layout is easy to navigate and the reviews are generally in agreement with my own observations.
Version 6.6 2012-11-01 5
I went to Rwanda on vacation for the summer of 2011,so this app really comes in handy to know a good hotel,sight seeing,restaurant ect.
This app is the best.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-10 5
This is a great program.  I have been using Trip Advisor for a while and really appreciate the feedback from other travelers.
Version 8.5 2014-03-25 5
Extremely useful domestically in the USA and international. Reviews give a truthful look so that you don't get disappointed.
Version 5.8 2011-08-20 5
I use trip advisor all the time when I travel to look for good hotels and restaurants. It's never let me down! A must for if you want good advise on food and places to stay...
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5
Great travel review app. Lots of helpful reviews in a streamlined format. Easy to find what you are looking for. Quick and simple to add your own reviews, too.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 3
I used to use the app quite a bit when traveling and planning trips. The latest versions have a problem sorting my saves. I'll try it by location and then by type (hotel) and it simply won't sort. Please fix this annoying bug to what used to be a better app.
Version 8.5 2014-03-25 5
I love this app.  It helps find great places to eat, wonderful attractions...hotels...the works.  Don't forget to give your reviews for each place you visit.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-20 5
Helped us many times to find the great restaurant all over the world! Invaluable. Also good to help us pick attractions to see and visit.
Version 5.7 2011-06-27 5
Well designed app that provides the functionality of tge full website and Trip Advisor is my primary information resource no matter where I travel.
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
Information is very up to date. 

Used for a trip to Europe and so far so good. Well organized site will make me want to use it over and over.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-17 4
I use this app quite a bit overseas where yelp doesn't exist. It's a bit buggy at times with random crashes and weird UI functionality, but it's the best app for travel info outside the US.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-23 5
I've been using TripAdvisor for over 5 years and LOVE it.  I love to travel and it's always the absolute first place I go for research and the most helpful & most reliable.
Version 5.5 2011-04-26 5
Great app. In some ways, this app us better than the full-blown website, particularly regarding viewing photos and some navigation.
Version 5.8 2011-10-03 5
Used this app on two extended trips.  Ratings reliable.  Nice to be able to see the opinions of others about all things related to travel.
Version 5.93 2012-03-07 5
This app does what it says it does, and works great. Its also really easy to use. I looked up hotels in california and booked 2 rooms from texas and planed my tours. I love this app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Use this app all the time as I travel a lot for both work and pleasure. Dependable performance and intuitive design.
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 5
I love using trip advisor for planning trips. I use feedback from others to determine where to go, stay and eat. Thanks to all who rates the places you go.
Version 5.5 2011-06-08 5
Trip advisor is the most current travel tool out there! It allows you to check dining, things to do and places to stay within minutes.
Version 5.93 2012-03-12 5
No need to carry your laptop to access info from tripadvisor - app is easy to use and the gps locator makes finding nearby restaurants and attractions quick.
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 4
Love the App.  My only complaint is that material accessible is not as updated as website.  I checked "Things to do" in Incline Village , Nevada and just got a bunch of golf courses.  The website has far more.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
You get the masses opinions that could save you from wasting time and money.  Places to eat, attractions, sites, you name it, it's on here. You can gripe if warranted or praise if deserved. Great FREE app!
Version 6.6 2012-11-04 5
An un-complicated, easy-to-use, website that gets you to your destination before you can leave your home. Love it
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 5
This app has been very helpful in planning our trip.  Haven't come across anything yet that it couldn't find info on.
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 2
With the latest update you can not sort through the different reviews for a place or restaurant. Before you could click 'terrible' or 'average' and read only the reviews giving this rating for a particular place.
I like being able to jump to the bad reviews to know what I might have in store for me. 
Please fix this!
Version 8.3 2013-12-30 5
I never plan a trip without extensive research on trip advisor. The app is also well designed and easy to navigate.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 2
Ok the app itself works and it could be useful, but the data is so out of date, how could this possibly be helpful?  I searched my local area (a very large town, which is incidentally 10 min from TripAdvisor's main office) for restaurants.   About a quarter of the hits were for places that have been closed for a few YEARS or more!!  Not very valuable advice.

Update your database!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-25 5
Got a smartphone for our trip to St Maarten & the trip advisor app was indispensable to have! Not sure I could have googled & found some of these places we are excited to try.
Version 5.7 2011-08-17 5
This is now a must have app for travel. It's especially useful since I take my iPad with me. I can look things up before I go so I know what to expect. This is a great app.
Version 5.91 2012-01-15 5
I have been using Tripadvisor for the past several years and is the only search engine that I use because it is easy and truthful. Thank you Tripadvisor  you are the BEST!!!!!!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
I was looking for a hotel in the outer banks, but all google maps was showing me was creepy dangerous places.  Trip advisor guided me to a Pawnshop that didn't ask questions and that night I slept safely with a 12 gauge next to me!  Thanks!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
Trip Advisor is my 'go to' app when I'm researching hotels and vacations. I trust the reviews and have never been disappointed. The app is well designed and easy to navigate.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
This is a terrific app! If you are traveling or just staying local check it out.  I've used it internationally as well as in the USA.  It has become my go to for info.  Thank you TA.
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 2
Love Trip Advisor, but this app definitely lacks substance. For example, cannot search on vacation rentals or access my personal account details (except for "saved" hotels).  Also had app crash several times during navigation. Hope to see improvements in future releases, but for now it is truly a bare bones version of the full site.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 5
When we travel we check TA first for hotels, attractions and restaurants. We find the reviews here the most authentic and reliable. Look here for honesty.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-11 5
This is by far the best resource for travel. The tips and forums has made a big difference on my Experience of Europe. What an amazing site!! Thank you so much!
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 5
They seemed to eliminate all of the navigational quirkiness that was in previous versions of this app! And it's now very fast. A very useful travel guidebook.
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 5
This is one of my favorite apps. It never freezes and very easy to navigate. So nice to have T. A. one touch away to plan trips or review a destination. Thank You for another great app!
Version 6.4 2012-08-21 3
Could stand to be upgraded to include the disabled community.  I am a two time stroke person, and i found your site   very difficult to navigate through for my needs.  I am very computer literate, and a college graduate, i found the navigation very difficult.  M.G.C.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 5
On a road trip from LA to Washington State, trip advisor was so helpful!  We did not have many planned stops so we used the app to help us find places to stay and eat! Love it!
Version 5.6 2011-06-24 5
I use this site constantly!  It is amazing to read reviews from people who just got back from where you are going only days before.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
I am on the road 200 plus nights a year .  I solely rely on Trip Advisor and it's reviews to choose the hotels I stay in.  They are the number one source for hotels.  I would be lost without them!
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 5
Would not travel anywhere without checking tis website first! Thanks to all of you who are sharing your experiences!
C Odell
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
I've used this app more times than I can count and have chosen hotels & restaurants based on all reviews good & not so.  I recommend this site and app to all.
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5
Who needs travel books when you have an IPad and the Trip Advisor app? We visited multiple cities in Europe and relied on the app for the top things to see and do.
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 5
You must have this APP if you're traveling, or use the website. It will save you hours of looking and the misery of bad places and things to do.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-27 5
I like using trip advisor to look for restaurants in areas along with hotels. I like the fact when there is a negative report, the owner can rebuttal it online.
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
This app has saved me! It pointed out bed bugs in high-range hotels. In one city I drove 15 miles to find bed big free hotel! You can count on the reviews!
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-05 5
Great for planning all the important aspects of a trip. Sleek and convenient; doesn't get much easier then this! Highly recommended for anyone planning a trip
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 5
This app has been great for traveling. We have found some very good places to stay and to eat.
Surprising were the restaurants that were close to us that we did not know about.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-15 5
Running my own business this app is ideal for keeping me connected with customers to see what we can do better or just keep doing!
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 4
Useful app to have in your mobile device if you travel at all. Especially great to have if your plans deviate a little from the itinerary and you find yourself off course and needing a meal, accommodation or the like.
Version 6.6 2012-12-01 5
Lots of quality reviews, quick to use, and can check prices and book easily
Version 6.6 2012-12-22 4
I really rely on Trip Advisor when I'm traveling to help me find places to avoid and places that are those "great finds" in a sea of endless options and so I like to return the favor and leave reviews. The app makes writing reviews super easy!  Love it!
Version 6.2 2012-06-19 5
You shouldn't go anywhere without first consulting Trip Advisor. Honest reviews and great information source!
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 5
Fast, easy to use information. I should use it more than I do, Internet access is a barrier but not the fault of the app of course.  Highly recommended
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 4
Enjoy reading other's reviews and find this app to be helpful, but the site could be better for someone trying to write a review. 
Find the Urban Spoon app to be better when looking/leaving reviews on restaurants.
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 4

Version 6.6 2012-10-23 5
I am a trip advisor nut!!! This app has saved me several time from making terrible travel choices. I love this app and travel advisor network!!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 5
Just like the website but sized for the iPad.  Excellent reviews.  Knows your location and tells you good places around your location to eat and sleep!
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 5
Lots of helpful information, well organized. It has quickly become the first place I check to scope out a city, a hotel, an attraction or an eatery.
Version 6.1 2012-06-09 5
I think this may be one of the top useful apps I have. It is great to see how a restaurant, attraction, or hotel you might want to choose rates. I use it all the time.
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 5
This is a great way to find out for locations that we are trying to visit, you can save so many problems reading the  comments!
Version 6.6 2012-12-15 5
This is a must for anyone who loves to travel. I can instantly see what's around me no matter where I am. We've found some amazing restaurants and fun places thanks to this app!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-12 5
I use TripAdvisor before staying in any hotel and depend on it for finding things to do and the best places to eat. 
It's like having a travel agent in your pocket!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-11 5
I've never run into any problems on this app. with neither my phone nor tablet. It's so handy in travel, but I wouldn't recommend for hotel searches. Otherwise it's awesome.
Version 5.8 2011-08-15 5
This has been a huge help to me in evaluating hotels. Some reviewers are completely full of it, and this app has tons of photos so you can judge for yourself.
Version 6.6 2012-10-13 5
I absolutely love this app!  Easy to use and the reviews come from real travelers and their experiences.  And photos add to the credibility.  Try it, you'll like it!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-18 5
Thanks TripAdvisor.  FYI, your app is much better than the website as far as map search and finding places nearby.
Version 5.8 2011-09-02 5
Simply a great app, easy to use, and full of helpful, current information. User reviews are informative and so far, found to be accurate in every way.
Version 6.6 2013-03-20 4
Overall the app is pretty good although I often can't find what I am looking for with the search, even if I use English or the local language spelling.
Version 5.9 2011-11-13 5
I love Trip Advisor and this app is just as great as the website. It never crashes. I don't go anywhere without checking reviews on this site and it's always been right so far.
Version 6.6 2013-04-24 5
Love having this app on my iPad mini so I can research and plan for my trip to Venice whenever I get a spare moment!!!!  Haven't had any problems with anything so far.
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 5
I use this app all the time to read reviews about hotels and restaurants. I am also an avid reviewer myself. I like the simplicity and efficiency of the app.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
This application saves you time and money by telling you where to go and what to expect.
Excellent tool to use when you are traveling and even when at home.
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
I use TripAdvisor primarily to chose hotels and restaurants while traveling. It's great to have a realistic idea of what I can expect.
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
Very helpful app while out and about. Only wish is that restaurants could be sorted by type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack).
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-24 5
I use the app over all other booking sites. The reviews by users are very helpful in determining where to stay, eat, etc.
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5
I found this app extremely helpful when deciding on hotels and excursions for my upcoming trip to Hawaii. Thanks to everyone for their input.
Version 6.2 2012-06-26 5
Love that this site is as good as those who contribute. Reading the ratings and reviews has helped plan multiple trips. Thank you for this site.
Version 6.6 2012-11-15 5
No matter where in the world you are traveling please check in here. Before and the again when done. It's  bind  -blower!
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 5
I enjoy the site. Please add your review. A few don't give a true picture of a place. Gripes and the overly enthusiastic can dominate on just a few reviews
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
Complete guide for the modern day traveler, well designed app to show what you want to see: hotels, restaurants, attractions. Easy to navigate, trustworthy info.
Version 6.2 2012-07-11 4
Good app to have when you go on a trip or want to find a new place to eat or place to explore. I used in Puerto Rico, very good but the Bing's maps are horrible it gave me direction to a place in USA. Please fix this. Use google map (this is a iPhone app)
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Handy way of negotiating the world or your neighborhood. Reliable app, but it's the content that makes it great. Thanks TA and all the contributors.
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
Found this app to very useful for finding restaurants and lodging while traveling and at home. Also found great hidden treasures and places to avoid.
Version 8.5 2014-02-27 5
Easy to use and I always use it when I want to try something new. I really appreciate other users opinions they make it easy to choose the best that's out there.
Version 5.8 2011-09-05 4
TripAdvisor is paying the price for my lazy usage. I won't give out 5 stars, because I just don't yet know the app well enough to give it a perfect score. FWIW, I think it's a 5. As I use it more, I will come back to revise the ranking.
Version 6.0 2012-03-16 3
I use this app a lot, the listings need a choice of being sorted alphabetically.  I don't want to scroll thru 300 restaurants looking for a certain name.  Also, the app is too quick to think it knows what I am going to enter in the search box.  How about letting me turn the autocomplete off?
Version 6.6 2013-02-18 1
So I decided to review a restaurant I recently ate at.  I write up the review, rate  the restaurant and hit the "submit" button.  Now I'm told I can't submit my review until I type in my password that I don't have because I didn't register.  Isn't something a little backwards here?  Anyway, I'm sick of registering and using passwords.  I just won't write any reviews.  However, I will continue to read other reviews so I'll grudgingly give this app one star.
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 5
Great app to get info on any place you want to travel! Accurate reviews from other travelers..and great recommendations for thing to do. I use this EVERY time I travel.
Version 8.3 2014-01-10 5
I love, love, love this app! It is easy to use and has just as much info as the online website. Easy to navigate with wonderful graphics and such. Download it!
Version 5.93 2012-03-07 5
Wanna sight see tour travel and not even have to think twice. With the trip adviser you got your food
Places to stay,things to do local to wherever you are on the fly!5stars
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 1
Who would have thought companies could ruin the beauty of the iPad interface. This is so terrible I go out of my way to use the browser version. For example, Cat Island, Bahamas. On the website Shanna's Cove is listed as a #1 spot.....search for it in the app, nothing. Talk about a backwards minimalistic application that applies none of the features in a fluid fashion that make tripadvisor a good tool. Ill be deleting this and creating a shortcut to the website.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-30 5
It's hard to please everyone & nothing will be perfect, but this is an awesome app to get atleast an idea before traveling to an unknown place. Thank you!!! Happy travels!
Version 5.92 2012-02-05 5
This is my go-to whether it's for a review for a local restaurant or for travelling. I highly recommend. I'm never disappointed with restaurants or hotels because I check here first.
Version 6.1 2012-05-06 3
I don't normally leave negative reviews, but since you nagged me to do it via in app popup...

I like the app but I very much dislike the new landscape only orientation.  I always use my iPad in Portrait.

Please bring this feature back!  Otherwise the app is well made and reliable.
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
Trip advisor is the best app for anyone planning a vacation or even just interested in a particular area! I never fail to find the perfect place to stay when I use this app!
Version 6.2 2012-07-02 5
What more could you ask for from an app dedicated to finding the best deals on the best travel services? It has all the tools I need.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
The reviews with this app for dining and accommodations are spot on!  No surprises, like what you get in reviews in "Yelp".  If the review is good, you can rely on it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-30 3
So many other sites have great visuals but I kinda like trip advisors stripped down appeal. However, it is too stripped down. It is primarily for travelers, if you are a host, forget it. Sites like Roomorama have stunning apps, and cheesy websites, trip advisor has sort of done the opposite here.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 5
You can find interesting places from anywhere. I love that option i hope in the future they could add more places
Version 5.8 2011-08-19 5
I LOVE to travel, especially taking road trips!  TripAdvisor is an excellent road trip companion!  Whether looking for a hotel, restaurant, or fun side trip!  TripAdvisor is the way to go!!!  Love it!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
I've been trying to plan a trip for weeks now and installed this app last night. It has been tremendously helpful!
Version 6.6 2012-10-18 4
Great info but it would be nice to sort by hotel brand- that way I can pick based on where I can get rewards points. It would be nice if you could define a radius around the search location
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
I love the street view pictures and map view. Perfect for vacation when you need a place to stay or a bite to eat. It is helping us save money by helping us avoid bad places!
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
Polished, easy to use and quite useful. The user reviews let you travel to new destinations with confidence. My go- to app for travel
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-31 5
Love this site and I have been using it for years.  I put in my own review when I try something.  I cannot figure out how to write a review on iPad though.
Version 5.7 2011-08-08 4
I love this app. It's even easier to use than on my computer. I love to see the customer "realistic" photos instead of the perfectly staged pics usually on the hotel sites. It gives a much better view of what the hotels really look like.
Version 6.6 2012-10-01 5
Tripadvisor is my go to travel site and has not disappointed me ever in my travels around the world. Good place to get honest photos and review of vacation destinations.
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5
This is a great handie tool I use it all the time all over the world . It is spot on . The food things to see just wonderful . Life is short use trip to take full advantage of time kent
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 5
Great app for traveling. I have used this app for the last week and it has come in very handy when pulling into a town that I'm not familiar with.
Version 5.7 2011-06-29 5
I love having Trip Advisor on my phone especially when I am out of town!!  We use it nonstop to fin things to do and places to eat!  Not sure we'd enjoy our vacations as much without it!!
Version 5.92 2012-01-27 5
Planning a vacation is an important part of the fun of traveling and trip advisor is a great tool for comparing choices at various places.  This app makes access so simple and easy to get started
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
Great app.  I wondered how everyone was uploading so many pics on tripadvisor.  I have used it online for years.  Now it is in my pocket.  Love the save feature for attractions!!
Version 6.6 2012-11-24 5

Version 5.8 2011-09-15 5
Best travel app I have seen.  Easy to use, great mapping. You can go from reviews of your neighborhood restaurants to the best spots outside Paris or Hong Kong. Travel Advisor is a travelers best friend!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-19 5
I use the trip advisor website to research hotels but this App is great for finding restaurants using "near me now" function.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 5
I travel very frequently and this app has been great for quick planning. It's fast and accurate. Makes booking complete packages fast and painless.
Version 5.92 2012-02-14 5
Makes searching for a hotel incredibly easy.  Plus real pics from actual visitors gives a more realistic view of destination- all in a click!
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 5
I've used the web site to gather opinions of other travellers about hotels I'd like to go to, and it's been very helpful. This app does the same, it is really useful.
Version 6.2 2012-06-13 5
We use trip advisor almost every day. We research cities to SE where we want to visit and then use the things to do for planning where are are going to visit. We find it a great tool.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 4
This is a great app except for being extremely difficult to update/change/remove your review.  There needs to be a tab that allows the reviewer easier access for this.  Otherwise, Trip Advisor is a great app.
Version 8.4 2014-01-31 5
Very helpful.  Useful to help find great places to go and directions to get there.  Indispensable if you are traveling and looking for diverse dining and hotels.
Version 6.1 2012-05-15 5
For those of us who rely on the reviews in TripAdvisor this app is perfect.  It maintains most of the functionality of my Mac version and on the iPad it's quite easy to use.
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5
This is a great app to use for general trip planning. It makes it easy to browse and rank your favorites. Great for planning a trip to a city you've never been to!
Version 7.0.1 2014-03-25 5
Trip Advisor is the best app to find great places to eat particularly when traveling. I would not dream if leaving home without it!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-12 5
Stumbled on on a family trip to Maine found a great restaurant in the middle of our drive. Looking forward to using this on my next road trip
Version 5.7 2011-09-18 5
I'm currently in Berlin and this app is great for finding places to go to and makes it super easy to show cab drivers where to go.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
This app is a must have if you to find out some great information. It helps to hear from those that have experienced a local place.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 4
Very helpful, clean, uncluttered appearance, easy navigation. Could be improved with more info up front on attractions(cost, hours of operation) instead of having to visit the attraction's website. No probs so far!
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I have found tripadvisor to be extremely valuable in planning trips and vacations. The app works well and is a needed extension of the website.
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 5
I love the trip advisor website but the iPad app is simply stunning! It's very well thought out and really easy to navigate. the new trip lists from users is also great
Version 5.6 2011-06-26 4
Nice to go so quickly to my favorite travel site, but I don't like that there is no history if I want to continue a search I started and want to go back to but it brings me to where I am currently. I will ask for that info if I want it.
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 5
We travel a lot and this app is really helpful. I have been using google, but I find myself using trip-adviser much more often.
Version 6.6 2012-11-18 4
I use it daily to check places and see what other people have to say so I'm happy with it . It's not like Yelp and you can't "Check In" @ places and they don't have a lot of the places as of yet but I'm sure it will grow in time.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
I can navigate through this app very easily and I really am enjoying the way I can just post reviews. Thank you TripAdvisor!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 5
I use TripAdvisor a lot during my travels, and I enjoy helping other travelers by writing my own reviews.  This app makes it all so easy.
Version 6.6 2013-02-27 5
Extensive listings of attractions and reviews by wide variety of travelers. I simply wouldn't travel without doing reads arch on Trip Advisor first.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 5
I usually don't book anything without checking out tripadvisor first. And the app makes it much easier
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
This is a must-have app whether or not you're traveling. My only suggestion:  ALL eating establishments (from dining to fast food) should have prices.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 4
Some places that had menus on the old version are missing them on the new one. Other than that the app is extremely helpful and easy to use.  Much improved navigation.
Version 6.2 2012-07-03 5
Love this App! We always use it before and during travel close to home and faraway! Don't leave home without it:-)!
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5
Love it, love it, love it.  Hubby researches on laptop while I use this app.  Super app!  Used Trip Advisor to plan tour of Venice.  So helpful.  We loved the Molino Stuckey Hilton in Venice and all the info on TA was priceless.
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 5
Got me through 3 weeks in Europe knowing nothing about any of the places I visited. Helped me book great hotels and awesome dinner reservations!
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 5
It remembers my searches, u can price comparison! You can even view pictures it has it all to book your trip!
Version 5.8 2011-08-28 5
I've written reviews and used this on my laptop for years now to fully use it on my iPhone. This is such a big help when traveling.
Version 5.8 2011-10-03 5
The most usable app for the most expansive and reliable site! Thanks for all the guidance over the years.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5
I have used this app all over the world. Almost never disappointed. Would recommend this as a trip starting point for anyone.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-12 2
Now that the ads (that help pay for the site) have taken over for hotels on the right, you can no longer 'save' hotels for later.  This makes it very difficult to plan a trip and makes the app useless. For me, saving places restaurants, and hotels is what I use the app for.  It also crashes frequently and looking at photos are difficult.
Version 5.91 2012-01-17 5
I use this app on my iPad and iPhone.  I have done some bookings  with it, but mainly for browsing and becoming informed.  It works equally as well as the website.
Version 6.1 2012-04-23 5
This app has been so helpful! The reviews of parks that are posted by users are super helpful! So easy to have all the info together rather than searching the vast Internet!!!!
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
Trip advisor has been invaluable to my husband and I. We re grateful for this application. Keep up the good work!
Version 6.5 2012-09-26 5
What a wonderful app this is we have used trip advisor with great success. Thanks to all that contribute with honest recommendations.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 5
I don't go anywhere without checking my tripadvisor ratings and see how other people enjoyed shops, attractions, Restaraunts.
Version 8.2 2013-12-04 5
I always check Trip Advisor before I consider hotels, attractions, restaurants. It's invaluable and a great resource. Can't go wrong with it.
Version 8.2 2013-12-06 5
I use it as much for planning and having the perfect trip as I do for reviews on things close to home. My 73 year old mom loves it too!
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
I just was using it on the web one day and came across it as an app. I thought I'd try it and now I just love to fool around with it and look at different areas!
Version 6.0 2012-03-14 5
I love this app for the iPad. I can search for flights and find places to eat while I'm traveling. It's so comprehensive you won't need any others.
Version 5.5 2011-05-01 5
Great app! Love the reviews, love the pics, love the tips! This app is a must-have for anyone who loves to travel whether for biz or pleasure. I'm never booking a trip again without consulting Trip Advisor first!
Version 6.1 2012-04-18 5
This app is a serious life saver !  I cannot stop using it for hotels, restaurants and Things To Do.  Photos and the reviews are super helpful.  LOVE the feature to Save or Call !
Highly recommend this app to everyone.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-01 5
This app is great. Have been adding restaurants and things to see to my saved list so it will be very easy and convenient to find the places on the go!
Version 8.2 2013-12-03 4
I like being able to both learn from others' experiences and pass on my own. It's fun revisiting. I just wish I could find my previous reviews-maybe I'm missing something.
Version 6.6 2012-12-16 5
Great at helping to make decisions about where to eat or spend the night. Gives right on feedback. I trust the Trip Advisor evaluations.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Trip advisor has been the most helpful source of travel info as I've planned trips in different parts of the world. Glad I have the iPhone app now!
Version 6.6 2013-03-06 5
I have been using the Trip-advisor web site for years. This mobile app just makes it that much handier to use. I love trip advisor
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-01 4
Really enjoy using this app for research. Heading to Puerto Rico with the family and found many good ideas for day trips.

Would like to see an activity menu for more specific searches.

Overall great app.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-14 5
I absolutely love this app. It is so helpful when traveling, and also helpful at home to see what other people are saying about my favorite restaurants.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-14 5
I absolutely love this app. It is so helpful when traveling, and also helpful at home to see what other people are saying about my favorite restaurants.
Version 5.6 2011-05-18 5
Just arrived in DC and was able to use trip advisor to locate everything ... Just too easy ... And I thought as a young teenager that I would never use a computer!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 5
We have used this more than out AAA book!  The reviews by locals and other travelers have been extremely helpful
Version 5.6 2011-07-28 5
We use this app to review hotels before booking....actual photos that travelers post are most helpful too.
Version 5.92 2012-02-07 5
Some of the reviewers are very particular which makes this even better. Their critiques are usually small to me but it assures me I'll enjoy the advice.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 3
Used to have one, just did an update and there's no longer a back button so when reading posts resulting from search terms you have to re search and reload vs just going back to the results list!
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
I have used this app while on vacation to find out about nearby hotels in order to plan next years vacation. I would recommend.
Version 5.9 2012-01-07 5
This app is A++ for looking up the real scoop of anywhere you plan to visit. Complete with reviews and pictures, this is a must have when planning a trip.
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 5
I just wish I had a "homepage" with past reviews and locations I have traveled.  BUT, what an incredibly user friendly ap.
Just moved to Italy and I use it almost daily.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
I have used Trip Advisor for planning trips to NYC, Florence, ITALY, Prague, and Reyjkavik...have found it particularly helpful in choosing hotels...no bedbugs yet!!!
Version 5.7 2011-08-09 5
In a week I'm going for vacation, this app helped me in great way to explore that place. Highlighting must visit places is wonderful thing in this app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5
Whether your looking for a flight, a hotel, or a vacation, nothing beats tripadvisor.  Easy to navigate you get all the info you need in seconds!
Version 6.6 2013-01-03 5
Love using this for my own cities and surrounding area ... and also of course when traveling.  So simple and helpful!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 5
Love this app so far. I needed a restaurant tonight in a city completely foreign to me and this app delivered with a variety of choices, and the reviews were spot on.
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 4
Great hotel info based on location but i would like to see more description of ammenities.  Pool? Indoor/outdoor? Fridge? Food? Other than having to read every review to hunt for clues this is a great place to find a place to stay.
Version 6.0 2012-03-14 5
Enjoying the new layout upgrade.  Much easier to locate specific restaurants, hotels, etc.  Always the first tool when planning a trip.
Version 5.7 2011-08-12 4
My girlfriend and I are going on vacation and did not no much about the place we where staying. This app shows you everything you need to know from where to stay , eat and go!
Version 6.2 2012-07-17 5
Especially terrific when traveling, if wi-fi is available.
Now if the whole world could get together on one type of cell service...........................
Version 6.4 2012-08-23 5
I travel a lot and I use this app every where I go... Telling you what restaurants to go to and rating them is very helpful. Best app to find places to eat out of the eight I have tried...
Version 6.6 2012-12-04 5
I've been using this app to research for an upcoming trip in Belize and it has helped a ton. I plan on also using it once I get there to find restaurants and stuff to do.
Version 5.92 2012-02-14 5
I have just downloaded it and I am using it to plan our trip to Lima & Quito.  So far it looks really useful.  We will have our iPads with us as we tour and review this summer
Version 6.0 2012-03-20 5
I travel a bunch and whether it's Cape Town or Christchurch, Amsterdam or surprisingly small towns in between, this is just the best for hotels, 
restaurants, things to do, etc
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 4
This app is truly a wonderful tool. 

My only complaint is that one can't add a restaurant that is not already listed. I often eat at great places that are not on TA, so I can't rate them. 

That being said, Most good restaurants are already added.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-31 3
It's a great app that I use whenever I travel. Only issue I'm having is when I am viewing certain hotels and I click on the images, it takes me to the middle or last images for that selection. I don't want to have to flip through 1000+ images to get to recent pictures.
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 5
This is one of best apps to have especially when you are traveling a lot, this app can and will help you make a better decision on. Where to stay and what to do.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
It was perfect before i installed the latest update..now it's hard to use and i can't find my location on trip advisor, also i cant find all the things to do that are on the website..
Version 5.8 2011-09-27 5
Trip Advisor us the best. We find excellent restaurants and things to do. You can't go wrong using Trip Advisor before making any plans.
Version 6.6 2013-03-30 5
Useful for going on the road, where to stay, what to eat and what to do.  Amazingly, the reviewers are normal people in TA, which means the reviews are very reliable.
Version 6.6 2013-02-13 5
Great app, perfect for planning a vacation, use while on vacation, and even in your own city to find restaurants that you haven't heard of.
Version 5.9 2011-11-10 4
This app neatly and cleanly delivers the most important features of TripAdvisor. Only wish there were more advanced sort features (such as "nearby restaurants under x price or with z type of food").
Version 6.1 2012-06-05 3
This was a great app before the forced update. Can't stand the  Bing maps, as finding locations of places has become more frustrating and slow. Still, good info- I always consult tripadvisor when I travel. I'll probably just use the website though.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
I have so enjoyed using this to get some info before I take my trips!!! I have also written my own reviews!! I think it is well worth using!! :0))
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
I would not dream of traveling without this app. Love the website and have used it for years before app!!! My go to for advice on travel!!!
Version 5.8 2011-09-02 5
Really effective version of the full web site. Perfect if you are trying to quickly decide what to do, make a call etc.
Version 6.3 2012-07-21 5
Good app   Perfect for travel. My only wish is they would let you know your review is at its size limit
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
I really like the app. Helpful in planning trips and seeing options for hotels, etc. I HATE FACEBOOK and wish you would drop the marketing for it.
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 5
I use this site for any place that I plan on visiting! It gives plenty of information and I love to read most recent customer reviews.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-03 1
The new update loads slower, closes out on me when i press BACK from viewing photos, this update has glitches I don't like the search method and I wish you guys would make it easier to find RESORTS/ hotels similar to the ones you previously looked at like if I viewed a few months  ago a 5 star resort with a lazy river it show me similar resorts, I would like to stay at in another place (state,country...)
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
I always use this app when traveling to find good breakfasts and hotels. It is easy to use and navigate. I have had no crashes on my iPad.
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 5
Well designed and easy to use. I've been posting and reading other posts for a few years now. I like the ease of use without the need for safari.
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
I have just gotten into tripadvisor & really loved the reviews and suggestions that are available. The forum has been a great way to get questions answered.
Version 6.6 2012-11-19 5
Works great. Identifying what is near you is really helpful. Always works and I can always count on the reviews.
Version 8.1 2014-01-06 5
Haven't used the app in a year or so.  Decided to re-download it and wow, what a great improvement.  I now use this instead of going to my browser.
Version 5.8 2011-09-06 5
I had to travel suddenly and downloaded this app.  I've been very happy with every restaurant and site that I've been to that I looked up on trip advisor.
Version 6.1 2012-05-15 4
It's so easy to book any hotel around the world with this application through your smart phone, thanks for lunching it here, it was so easy to find the hotel I was looking for, you have covered almost all around the world.
Version 6.2 2012-06-26 3
It does not remember your last location...you come back the app and have to put in your location again (I don't like using the automatic location finder...or signing in.. Where I am is my business)

It seems it would be easy to have a "history" or for it too default to your last location..
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-29 5
I user this site for all my travel needs.    Check out the forums to interact with others making your same trip!
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
Use this app before during and after all my trips! Easy to use and informative!
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 5
Before visiting any new area I check with this app to see the general 'lay of the land', what is the general feel for the place and price structure.
Version 5.9 2011-12-04 3
This is a really cool adaption of the awesome web site. The thing that I've found most frustrating though is that the back button doesn't always take you back the way you navigated to a page and you have to start afresh too many times.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 4
Loving this app - with the exception of the 200 char minimum for submitted reviews. TA-team, please allow shorter reviews! Sometimes a short, to the point review says more than a thousand words.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
I have been using their website for years now. I find it an excellent resource when researching my travels. The app is a welcome addition to my iPad. Thank you,
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
My iPad and trip advisor ap are the perfect traveling companions.  I have been a long time fan of Trip Advisor.  The iPhone ap is a great way to access all the great features.
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 5
Information gives us the confidence to step out of the box a bit when we travel to new places!
Version 6.4 2012-09-06 5
Especially like the "Find Nearby" feature. Suggestion would be to rank by stars. Worth the download for any traveler
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Have been using this app I think for about 6 months now & it has performed very well. No problems whatsoever. I'd pay for it if it wasn't free!! Love it!!
Version 6.6 2013-03-09 5
Good, handy app! Just leave me alone about writing a review! Seriously though, don't travel without it!!!
Version 8.4 2014-02-03 4
By far the best app out. Use it in other countries all the time and to plan travel. Only complaint is mobile reviews don't allow you to fill out the full main page review
Version 6.2 2012-07-14 3
I have been using trip advisor for some time and quite often so it's annoying when I'm asked to sign in to Facebook every time I pull up the app. I don't have a Facebook account and would like to be able to bypass that screen.
Version 5.9 2011-12-12 5
I already liked the web version, but the phone app is so easy to use and provides perfect information for what you are looking for. Thanks
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 5
Need to find a flight? TripAdvisor app is the place to look  Quick, efficient showing all choices, prices and comparisons
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
I'm having a destination wedding and getting to see new photos (almost daily) of others is great! This site is helping me worry less about our trip/big day!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Have been using the computer version for several years. The information is very useful and accurate. The phone app is a great addition!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-04 5
Used it all week long on our recent trip to Maui, very helpful in finding all the great restaurants and sites to visit!
They even sent me a really cool TRIP ADVISOR travel bag...  XOXO
Version 5.5 2011-04-26 5
I have used this app a couple of times over the past week, and find this very useful. Much easier / faster access to TA's rich content ans valuable database. I love it!
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 4
Just playing with iPad2 to determine which apps will help on our long trips all over the world.  TripAdvisor is always helpful, so I'm enjoying this app, and pleased at the differences given the location finder ability.
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 5
I use this app to rate places that I've been to whether it be restaurants, hotels or businesses.  I also will read reviews of places before I go to know what I'm in for.
Version 6.0 2012-03-30 4
Great App....I have found flight info' easily and saved numerous amounts with the options of flights shown. The whole process from finding the flights, refining the airline and options is so easy!
Version 5.93 2012-02-28 5
I'm the kind of person who will read the negative reviews before the positives and I use this app to review hotels, cruise excursions, and such...Great app for that!!
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 4
We have Trip Advisor a great help in planning vacations.  The app is good, although of the functions are awkward. We wished it better mirrored the website.  All in all though very good. Will stay on my iPad for sure.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-27 5
I absolutely LOVE This App! It is extremely helpful. Just search any city and find hotels, restaurants and things to do. Love the reviews too!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-20 4
Required for the frequent traveler dissatisfied with hotel food. Reviews are on point (generally) without notable histrionics.

Addition of URL's to restaurant sites, especially menus, would aid the utility of the app.
Version 8.5 2014-03-21 5
A great way to find out what normal people think about places and find the best places to experience when traveling.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 4
I like it that it synchs with Facebook, so the world knows where I'm at, lol.  also great material, info from people that has actually  been to the suggested places.  No better critic that us that pay to stay places, eat at places, and so on.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-03 5
I use this app quite a bit to find restaurants and hotels, both near and far. And I contribute quite a bit. Definitely worth using!
Version 5.7 2011-07-06 5
Comes in quite handy when looking for general things to see & do... The maps & pics help out too. This serves as my personal travel expert.
Version 8.5 2014-03-02 4
I use it every time I travel.  It is better than other apps.    Just keep the improvements coming!   More maps/recommendations of cities available offline pls.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-11 5
Would not plan a vacation without checking put trip advisor.  Always helpful everywhere we go.
Version 5.9 2012-01-22 5
I don't go anywhere without checking what everyone has to say here! Have found it to be very accurate and have not been disappointed!
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
This is my favorite travel app for finding things to do, restaurants, and hotel locations.  Easy to use, very informative, and honest reviews.
Version 6.6 2012-12-22 5
Never have to roll the dice when visiting a new town. This app is easy and helpful in finding where to stay and eat without an unwelcome surprise.
Version 6.4 2012-12-26 5
I love the ability the app has to save things you are interested in and organize a whole trip. Really easy to use and a great resource to have.
Version 6.6 2013-02-06 4
I've been muddling through a sorts of apps today. I've been somewhat frustrated and the Trip Advisor App finally got me the information I needed, quickly and efficiently.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-20 5
Used it for our last vacation and were well-prepared after reading all the reviews!  Map could use some upgrades. But still great app.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-13 5
One of the greatest application on its kind. I have been using it for about two years, and I can't complain. Def. recommend it to everyone
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
Gives you an easy way to find the best restaurants, attractions, etc. all in one place.  Nice way to "discover" new places.  We are loving it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
The Trip Advisor app interface is well designed and a must have if you take "stumble upon" vacations or simply are looking for the best place to stay, eat, or see.
Version 5.92 2012-02-14 5
It is interesting to read all about the local places around here.  I am just getting started. I will read more every day.  thanks for al the interesting information.
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 5
If you're a traveler, you will benefit from this app.  I am always using it to check out hotels that I plan to stay in.  You can't go wrong with this app.  Love it!
Version 6.2 2012-06-12 4
Would be as good as web site if they sorted pictures in the same manner.  Also, perhaps the ability to recommend sites or even create a route with things along the way for those that road trip.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-19 5
This is the best app for travel. Especially when you in a foreign country where people don't speak much English
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 4
It's a convenient little app. I think that some of the reviews are a little harsh. I wouldn't use this app exclusively. It compliments other apps. For example, who cares about maps! I have a Google Maps app for that.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 5
I found the perfect weekend get-a-way place to celebrate my husband's birthday.  It was a little Shakespearean theater in Atlanta.  I would never have found it without this app.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
the app always has the places I'm looking for and there's tons of information easily accessible
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-29 5
Great till u sign up and ask to review after every search for something. So we will see after this rating for the site. Every thing else is awesome and I mean it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-17 5
This is a great ap for travelers. I used it throughout my 2 week trip up and down the Oregon coast and it was spot on. Outstanding recommendations for food and hotels.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 5
My wife and I really enjoy traveling to places we are not familiar with. I have come to depend on this app to give me help on my choices of where to go, stay, and eat.
Version 5.8 2011-10-29 5
The wealth of travel information  is invaluable.  There isn't anything you can't find.   The app is easy to use.   Definitely one app to have if you love to travel.
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
Fabulous app!  I have been very satisfied with the ease of use and how accurate the information is. I'm also grateful for the reviews on places I go!  Thank you!
Version 5.93 2012-03-02 5
Each review was quite accurate , also when you can contact other people and ask them they're personal experiences.
Version 6.2 2012-06-15 5
Trip Advisor is very useful. I wish they'd highlight the GPS function more, making it larger/more prominent to find restaurants near you, but I love it.
Version 6.6 2013-02-08 5
I could not have chosen a better place!! It's fool of life. It's safe! You make friends! Everyone is friendly, specially John at the cafeteria!! The guy rocks!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-07 5
Easy to navigate, extremely helpful and user friendly. I love everything about this app.  I don't leave town without it.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-15 5
I found so many great hotels restaurants and things to do on this app. I use it now as  well to share my experiences to fellow travelers
Version 5.9 2011-12-31 5
App is very handy for researching places to stay and things to do while traveling. Would recommend. 

I rely on Tripadvisor worldwide.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
I use this all the time as a guide for choosing hotels and restaurants when I travel. Very easy to use. A word of advice-if the review from a traveler is written like a brochure, it's probably from a friend or family member of the owner
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 3
Seems to find restaurants OK but the search feature is highly lacking. While in Chicago I searched for Attractions / Casinos. The search came up with New Jersey and an obscure hotel in Maine.  There are no less than 8 casinos within 50 miles of Chicago and this app missed EVERY one of them!
Version 6.6 2013-04-30 3
When I'm traveling, the last thing I want is an app that consumes my bandwidth like crazy. The new bigger pics are not an improvement. They help use up my account allotment and my battery by taking longer to download. Think it through next time please!
Version 5.5 2011-04-26 5
I'm not familiar with the website from TA, but this little free AP is very helpful with all the information one needs to make an informed decision at one's fingertips.
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 5
I am using this app like crazy to figure out a winter getaway this year. It's helpful, includes pics, reviews, and many helpful features. :)
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 4
I always check trip advisor before I make a booking, it's not just the reviews, but the responses that also contribute equally to my decision, it's great to have a tool like this! Cheers to more informed travel & stay!
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 4
This is a very goo App which we use frequently while traveling. Would like to a feature which would give me directions and a map from where I am. Maybe I,m missing something.
Version 6.0 2012-03-15 4
I usually use the web version, esp for writing reviews but the app is great for getting quick tips. Love the restaurant and activity info for days/trips you don't want to carry around LonelyPlanet.
Version 6.1 2012-05-15 4
App is great but it would be wonderful to include a "Best Local Cuisine to Try" under the eat section. Also, let users cast negative votes (reviews mentioning "Hidden Gem"). Finally, allow saved attractions to be easily viewed offline.
Version 6.6 2013-03-11 5
Easy to use, we'll organized and offers the best, most needed information for day trippers to experienced travelers.
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 4
I recently started traveling more and a friend showed me this app. After starting to use it, I have come to rely on it more and more. One downside would be that it doesn't always display all options a given area.
Version 5.9 2011-11-18 5
Highly recommend this app to anyone thinking about traveling or checking out a specific area!!
Version 5.92 2012-01-29 5
My trip to Tahiti would have been a total miss without the reviews on Trip Advisor. It was completely invaluable in choosing where to eat, what to do, and where to stay.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-15 5
I really find this app useful when planning activities for a trip to a new location!
Version 5.7 2011-08-14 4
The tripadvisor  app is great for finding hotels in an unfamiliar city.  Been using it to plan my honeymoon. However, this latest update of the app seems to be crashing a lot on my iPad! Please fix!
Version 5.91 2012-01-14 5
I really like this app, it's so fun to look up your trips before you take them and see if it's worth even going to an attraction. I recommend this app to all travelers!
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 5
I love this app. I've only had it a few minutes but I checked out everything in my local town. And it seems to work great
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 5
Whether you are a world traveler or just love to take road trips or just want to find new things to do locally, this is an app that you should have on your iPhone and/or iPad! Awesome app!
Version 5.8 2011-08-16 5
This app is helpful in more than one way. Tripadvisor has photos, reviews and resort rankings. I would recommend this app to anyone.
Version 5.8 2011-10-08 5
Everything you need not only when planning but while you're on vacation.
Version 5.9 2012-01-01 4
This is the best tool to track businesses and decide if you want to stop.  More people should take the few minutes to write a review.  Everyones opinion matters and you might help someone else from having a bad experience.
Version 6.2 2012-06-21 5
I have found TA user review to be very reliable and love the app to make these available for my trips and even at home!
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5
This app is perfect. I used it when my family drove a 3600 mike round trip. I'm only sorry I didn't come across it until we were on our way home!
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5
This is one of the best travel planning tools I've used so far. Helps rate the hotels and also helps find places to see. 
I have discovered some places in my on neighborhood, thanks to this app.
Version 3.0 2011-08-12 5
This is a great site to use both locally and for trips. It takes much of the guessing out of trip planning for lodging, food and services. It's a great tool!
Version 5.7 2011-08-13 5
Love this app for both the Ipad2 & the Iphone4.  Works great for anyplace u want to check out while out and about w/o access to the laptop or desktop.
Version 6.3 2012-09-11 5
We use TA primarily for restaurants, when we travel, which is frequently.  We are able to find great restaurants so it is easier to make good selections.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
I like using Trip Advisor when traveling or sometimes around home for new ideas. Easy to use.
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5
Trip Advisor always help me find nice places and activities wherever I go. And more important, the community is very committed giving its best to write good reviews.
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 4
I use this app a lot- only downsides are it's sometimes confusing to navigate and when you press the back button on the forum it takes you back to number 1 instead of the previous entry.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
If you like Trip Advisor on the web you'll probably find this app pretty useful. It's a great research tool.
Version 6.2 2012-06-26 5
Glad to have had so I could plan our family vacation but still have the ability to be a little spontaneous.  Thanks
Version 5.8 2011-10-01 5
This makes searching for a hotel so much easier and less time consuming than trying to do it on regular Internet pages. Thank you tripadvisor!
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
We travel a lot, and my first choice to figure out what to do in the towns that we visit would be trip advisor. It rates the number one location to the 20th location and so on. I love this app...
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Rarely disappointed in the results of fellow travelers.   And the app is well organized and quick to use.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-09 5
This app is the best tool to help people book their trips. I love the reviews because they help me pick the places where I want to go. Even though , need to use your own criteria.
Version 7.1 2013-07-16 3
I  downloaded trip advisor App for my iPhone. It shows information about large cities, places, destinations however, Information about hotels, restaurants and newer places are not in the data. It really did not help me much.
Version 8.4 2014-02-02 5
We used trip adviser for our getaway weekend & we had a great experience due to trip adviser 

Went to hilton in scranton PA
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 5
This app has been surprisingly comprehensive and helpful for trips I've taken to Vancouver, Seattle, Berlin, and the coast of Turkey.
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
Trip advisor is the best source on the Internet for hotel reviews. Having the phone app makes it even better. I feel secure in my choices with this app.
Version 5.92 2012-02-11 5
Great travel app. My only complaint is that I wish I could sort out reviews by how many stars reviewers give, but honestly that's nitpicky. Very helpful app.
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 5
I travel a few times a year, new destinations mostly. This app has been very helpful in locating hotels and restaurants in new areas.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 2
This app is missing many of the web page's features. You can only view hotels and restaurants, not vacation rentals. When you rate hotels, you are only allowed to give an overall star-rating, instead of rating the usual 4 or 5 categories. So far I haven't found anything that the app does better than the web page.
Version 5.92 2012-01-18 5
I follow it closely when I travel.  I have learned to read about the last 10 submitted reviews to get a good feel for the current trend on an establishment.
Version 6.0 2012-03-22 5
Excellent App!  This has proven to be a great tool when planning a trip, especially when visiting various cities and sites.  Highly recommended!
Version 5.7 2011-06-29 5
I stumbled upon trip advisor while my family and I were traveling to Washington dc and it became our go-to for everything. Wonderful app,great tool
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
Found that this app is very helpful for planning vacations, locating restaurants, and seeing real pictures of hotels.   Awesome app. A must have for any traveler.
Version 6.2 2012-07-05 5
Went to St Thomas VI. This app helped us out with decisions of key attractions and food venues. The biggest advocate to "time" which is precious! Enjoy
Glenn n Lindsay
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 5
I love this app.  It's a must have especially when you are traveling. Easy to write reviews on the spot and you can add photos directly from the app too.
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
Easy format makes it simple to review things while on a trip as well as avoid places which get bad reviews!
Version 5.5 2011-04-29 5
Love it.  Wish there was a way to save some of the sites or hotel so when ready to book, the site is already there.  Have been sending to web browser and bookmarking it instead.
Version 5.6 2011-05-23 4
I haven't gotten the chance to buy a ticket yet, but I love the ease and speed of the app. All the important information at the tip of your fingers. I love the flight search section. They should be an option that allows you to save searches also.
Version 5.7 2011-08-12 5
I love this app...it brings you the power of tripadvisor on the go, and it is great for times when you are somewhere new, and just want to find something to do.
Version 5.91 2012-01-16 5
Always check trip advisor before going anywhere. Why take a chance when you can know ahead of time..love this app
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 4
This is a great app for the iPad. Quick access to anything, anywhere. Planing a trip to Cape Cod & Wildwood, NJ in the very near future. I will do all of it on the go, searching for a good WiFi has become my passion in life!
Version 5.9 2011-11-23 5
I went to Hawaii and found several useful information from tripadvisor, definitely a good tool to use when you travel
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 5
Love it when traveling.  I use trip advisor at home to get the skinny on places I am going to.  This is perfect when actually there.
Version 5.93 2012-03-11 5
Easy to navigate. And much more accurate and reliable reviews than other travel rating applications, like Yelp.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Every city I visit I check out on Tripadvisor. Have found so many great local restaurants and activities by checking here first.  Thanks for the info!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 5
I use this app all the time to get fast opinion so as not waste time or money in a tried and tested restaurant or hotel. It is easy to use.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-15 5
Use it quite a bit, especially in places i'm not that familiar with. Or to look for new places in the old neighborhood.
Version 6.0 2012-03-23 5
Great app to have and explore future vacations or dream destinations! Keep up the good work and keep improving on the technology! My favorite app
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-18 5
Very helpful app. I used this to help me decide on a hotel. Loved being able to look at pics and read reviews to help me with my decision.
Version 2.0 2008-08-18 2
Sad.  This looked promising.  However, attempts to change the filter proved futile.  The same restaurants turned up no matter how I set the "star" requirement or distance allowed.   I searched for instructions online that might let me know if the problem were user error, but only found the Trip Advisor site, not a site devoted to the iPhone Ap.
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 4
This is a great app that functions almost as well as the website. But on the iPad it's almost unnecessary because the website works almost as well as the app. Confused? The app is free and works great, so I prefer the app on the iPad.
Version 5.8 2011-08-14 5
Love this app. Use it everywhere we go. It has great recommendations and the places it suggests are reasonable and fun. It is great for those of us who have children to entertain !!!
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 5
I'm planning to use my IPad on future trips and this TripAdvisor app looks like it'll come in very handy.  Really simple to use with lots of great information.
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 4
I have used the site sparingly in my European travels, but some of the insights from users are great. So, trip advisor is great for having the forethought to attract great users with useful, interesting information about places.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 5
I just plainly love this app. It helps me in selecting the places to travel, eat, stay. Reviews are useful and the app is user-friendly.
Version 5.9 2011-11-08 5
I use this app all the time to crowd source my surroundings when navigating new areas. Very useful.
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 4
I like this app.  It has a lot of information to assist in planning road trips.  I have used it several times already!  If someone has questions regarding places to visit, I will recommend this app
Version 6.6 2012-10-25 1
So which is it: You want me to use my Facebook credentials to create my TripAdvisor account so you can advertise in my timeline, or you simply don't have a create account process that works reliably????

Either way, I have never had so much difficulty with the sign up process on an app. I simply wanted to rate a company with whom I had a wonderfully positive experience and Trip Advisor ruined that!!!!!

Shame on you!

Crap App!
Version 5.92 2012-01-24 5
Many valuable reviews and well organized article. Hope to have more precise and easy to read reviews in app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-31 5
Nearly as much functionality as the website and I don't have any problems with it on either my iPad and iPhone. Simply works.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
I love this app. I like to read for reviews before I commit to spending my money.  I also will write reviews and add photos. This app makes this so easy.
Version 6.6 2013-01-01 5
It's great how you can review an area and save the things you would like to do in that area for when you visit next.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
It's great when you're about to book a flight for the lowest fare. It also give you places to go around your area which is real handy
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 4
Very useful.  What I liked is the ease of use. Finding what I wanted was a breeze....however, use of google maps instead of Bing would have been much better.  Bing does not cover the area I live .w
Version 6.1 2012-07-24 5
Than being able to research a property/location based on others traveling experience.  Saves a world of time and a world of Money!  Good tool.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Trip Adviser is known for hotel reviews, but I truly love to use the "nearby attractions" feature to find fun things to do near my hotel.
Version 5.8 2011-09-03 5
Amazing app, love it! Searched for and then booked hotel from my phone while at the passport office and was able to show my international reservation right there!
Version 5.92 2012-02-09 5
I am loving my trip watch apps, it's clear, clean and to the point, don't have to go through all those other sites to see the flights that I want,I am giving it five stars.
Version 8.2 2013-12-07 5
This is a great app. It is very helpful if you 're in an unfamiliar place. Love the reviews other travelers give. You can find different venues in almost any city.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-26 4
I used this to find hotels and restaurant on my trip to AR. It also gave great day trip ideas that were fun. I will be keeping it in my phone to use for future trips and for suggestions of things to do near home.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 2
Installed update on orig. iPad.  Operation is now sluggish with frequent freezes/crashes containing message that "the page went away".  Only way out is to exit app and wait for it to finally clear so I can start over.  This has been my go-to app for travel info, so this is very frustrating.  Hope it is fixed soon!
Version 5.5 2011-05-06 5
I've spent hours searching Internet sites trying to find ideas for what there is to do nearby, and it came up with way more results in just minutes!
Version 6.5 2012-09-25 5
Haven't used the app in a year or so.  Decided to re-download it and wow, what a great improvement.  I now use this instead of going to my browser.
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 5
Comes with reviews and a summary of the experiences, better than a paper pamphlet you would get in hotels and airports!
Version 8.2 2013-12-06 5
Love this app. Always find where to go when you travel. With many people on it, it's great to find local places to eat & visit while you are away.
Version 5.4 2011-04-18 5
I just returned from a cross country driving trip and used this app everyday. It was great to locate hotels along the interstate and read the reviews.  Also great for trip lists. Great app Love it!
Version 5.9 2012-01-04 5
Greatest app to use when traveling...used app to book my hotel for discounted price and found lots of recommendations for things I can do!
Version 8.3 2014-01-05 5
This is a great tool for researching peoples takes on various things-especially restaurants!!  I love reading the reviews before going to try a new place.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
Tripadvisor has become my go to app for hotel and flight comparisons- check them out you'll be glad you did...
Version 8.5 2014-02-27 5
I always use it to select Resturants. Just make sure there are 30 or more reviews since there are some fake ones.
Version 5.6 2011-06-27 5
I luv this app. Can search information during trips, can write a review instantly, do not have to wait, can do them while info is fresh.
Version 6.1 2012-05-15 3
This is my go-to resource for hotel reviews, and I had no complaints about the app until recently. I'm not crazy about the new front screen, and it's easy to get in a state, for example, where See on Map doesn't work but See What's Nearby does.
Version 6.6 2012-10-23 1
I would have thought TA could come up with a worthwhile app, but I find this app very frustrating to use. So much so, I deleted it. I much prefer the website for researching destinations. The app doesn't seem to find things that the website searches do, plus you can't track your account activity. It may work for local gps searches, but as a trip research tool on the iPad, I will stick with the TA website.
Version 5.9 2011-12-13 5
I'm a Hilton snob - so I often use this to rate where they stand on the area... Great reviews from guests, pics, etc. great map features and ability to see relative prices as well.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 4
We travel with ous children and went to London and Paris and found this app very helpful. I would like more specifics in the searches for child friendly restaurants. Perhaps, one that specifies a menu?
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 5
Great on the fly when you are in a pinch and need to find something fast. Helps you when you travel, it is a must for travelers.
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 4
I love luxury but I love a bargain too.  I do not like to be deceived, so I take my time and read the reviews on trip advisor.  I also look at fractures pictures & videos before I decide where I'm going to travel.  Thanks Trip Advisor.
Version 6.6 2013-02-07 5
I absolutely love this app. So practical in cities where you're a tourist or even your own. Flight search it's quick & accurate. Thank you!
Version 5.9 2011-12-17 5
Very helpful in figuring out the lay of the land when planning a vacation. Especially if you don't want to stay at the big chain hotels, etc.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-02 5
In a trip to Florida, I relied on this app for all my adventures, and I was not disappointed. It has stuff on the big touristy cities and on the small local stuff too. Love it!
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 3
Nice to have when traveling and trying to find places to eat. Would like one more filter to be able to specify that I am looking for a breakfast, lunch, or dinner place. Don't tell me there is a great little place around the corner for food when they primarily just serve or specialize in breakfast.
Version 5.7 2011-08-21 5
I never go out of town without consulting with TripAdvisor. App is has great features especially the trip lists of other users.
Version 5.8 2011-10-27 5
The app is a must for any traveler. You'll find reliable reviews for hotels and restaurants from fellow travelers for where your trip takes.
Version 5.9 2012-01-20 5
Es bien practico poder buscar un hotel para visitarlo y leer las opiniones de las personas que ya lo han visitado.  Como Consultora Independiente de Viajes tengo esta excelente herramienta.
Le doy cinco (5) estrellas a TripAdvisor
Version 6.1 2012-05-10 5
Tripadviser App is my gate for planning the excellent exciting trips for myself and for the family.  Reading the reviews gives you a good idea what to expect.  I love this App.
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5
I enjoy using this app. Makes it so easy to find close by restaurants, hotels and attractions. I have used this extensively while traveling.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-25 5
Extremely helpful tool for someone on the road a lot - or the occasional vacationing family. The reviews are great! Won't go anywhere without this app!
Version 8.4 2014-02-03 5
Excellent performance from this application. Good search filters and quick results.
Version 5.8 2011-08-16 5
Excellent description of available activities, lodging and restaurants.  Great o have when traveling to new areas
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 5
Really easy to use and great presentation of maps, reviews and more. Sooooo much better than using a web browser.
Version 8.5 2014-03-31 5
Im loving this app and site. The forum is beyond useful and so far it a breeze to find my way. I'm sure it will be a necessity for my trip
Version 5.92 2012-02-05 5
My family recently used the app as we are traveling to North Dakota and Canada for business.  We are pleased with the easy access for hotels, restaurants and points of interest. So far so good!
Version 5.0 2010-05-10 3
A bit better than before, but still needs some work to polih it up. The website is a much better place for info. Would like to be able to add reviews  in app and for some reason it wasn't able to find my location. Back button or recent searches would be handy.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-18 5
To whom ever needs a concise informative and a very interactive tool to help make that crucial decision of where and how then the Trip Advisor App is the one.......and i hate apps...so try it...
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 3
The app is solid but not much better than browsing on safari. Some upgrades would help, such as remembering your filter when you use the Back button (annoying), the option to open the page in safari, sort by location. Like the Save function.
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
Great app for us travelers. It is really helpful to get a little insight to an unfamiliar area. A definite added bonus when traveling or just exploring one's surrounding area.
Version 6.2 2012-07-20 5
It's my go to app for anyplace I have not been before to get extremely helpful reviews and tips on hotel locations anywhere in the world!  Love it!
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
I travel a lot and am often checking multiple sites to find the best connections. This program is a one-stop for this kind of thing and saves LOTS of time and hassle.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
if I leave the app (without closing it) to use another app, it forgets where I was so I have to re-enter all the data (country, state, city, forum, search for, etc).  That's really frustrating.  Otherwise, it's a really good and useful app.
Version 8.2 2013-12-11 2
Where is the month view of the search by lowest price feature? The compare price of nearby dates feature is helpful, but why does it not show prices automatically? It's quite inconvenient to have to click each date and load the entire new set of prices just to see the lowest price for that date.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
Hardly go to eat anywhere out of town without checking trip advisor. Usually correct
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-15 2
I have tried to use this app on my iPad and it just doesn't work very well for me. Maybe it's because I have an original iPad. In any case, the app freezes, is slow to react, and is counter intuitive to use. I finally gave up and just go to the website which suits me fine and never crashes.
Version 8.3 2014-01-02 5
Wonderful app and really makes traveling a lot less of a crap shoot. Saves my bacon tons of times! Could not travel without it. Should be 10 stars!
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
I have found Trip Advisor to be an excellent service on any platform, and it's gotten even better with it's iPad app. Fast, colorful, and very easy to navigate.
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
I have used Trip Advisor extensively through the years as I have planned trips to Italy, Sweden, and Norway. I count on this resource for unbiased advice.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
Been on the road for 2 weeks and used Trip Advisor many times! Very useful to read reviews before making decisions!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-08 5
This is a really good mobile app. I haven't found any issues with it and I find it easy to get real time reviews and pictures of many resorts.
Version 5.5 2011-08-12 5
I have always loved Trip Advisor and this app delivers. I just wish I could see the hotel's star rating without clicking on it first, otherwise perfect.
Version 6.1 2012-05-10 5
Great place for honest reviews good for hotels and restaurants. Use this site always for trips and such, gives you great ideas for dinners and entertainment.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
great for researching trips or looking for a place to eat when traveling, also a great place to find some helpful advice.
Version 5.92 2012-01-23 5
I love tripadvisor because I can share my ratings with the rest of the world and I can read other peoples reviews to advise myself. I find it very fun and interesting.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-03 1
I'm in charlotte, nc.  I selected current location from the opening screen then selected restaurants.  The app pulled up the "Current" restaurant in Washington DC.  I then tried to sign in and the app ignored my constant clicks on the sign in button.  I then exited out of frustration.  I've used the app several time since it was updated and have been frustrated with the navigation every time.  Please fix this thing.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Largest, most accurate reviews I've found and in this well designed app. 

Make sure you drill into the reviews a bit.
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 5
I absolutely love the street views in this app! The map zooms in and out flawlessly. I also like that it tells you what's in the neighborhood and how far away it is.
Version 5.9 2011-11-21 5
On a road trip from Austin, Tx to Santa Fe and back via Carlsbad Caverns and Marfa, Tx.  All I can say is that we haven't been disappointed yet, especially in how up-to-date it is.
Version 5.9 2012-01-03 4
This app is extremely helpful! Anything you want to find either near you or far away you can check it out. I mean sure.., not EVERY PLACE is on this app but very rarely will that happen that you don't find it! It's real good, get it!
Version 6.1 2012-06-11 5
Since I am a frequent business traveler,  this app continuously has helped us find the better restaurants no matter where we are in US...  Great product!
Version 6.4 2012-08-23 4
Have always used the site for planning and booking trips all over the world. Info is accurate and very helpful, especially their rating system. Highly recommended.
Version 6.6 2013-04-08 4
I quite like having a portable travel resource. I have a hard time using the maps and do prefer the desktop version, but I haven't tried since the updates so perhaps they've improved
Version 6.1 2012-05-16 5
Great user-friendly functionality makes trip planning efficient and fun.  iPad interface is better than on a computer!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 5
This site has proven VERY helpful in planning our family's European vacation. I especially like the Traveler photos posted for hotels.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-02 5
You ever found yourself away from home in an unfamiliar place and trying to find something to do?  This app solves that problem.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-23 3
I like this app, but it's nowhere as complete as the desktop version. For instance, on the desktop version you can see your profile, contributions, etc.
With this app, you don't have that option. I'll rate this app higher if you add this feature.
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
I've been using it for only ten minutes and I am impressed! I travel alot for work and need to book customers in hotel rooms.  This makes it so easy to research!
Version 5.8 2011-08-20 5
I just discovered this app while planning a trip to Disneyland.  It is so easy to use and fast.  The map with locations is useful.
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 4
As an expert in eating in wonderful restaurants around the world we were particularly pleased with our dining experience at Kogo. Both the food and the  service were commendable and the wine list was good and reasonable.
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 4
Reviews given are truthful. Love that you can post your vacation pics & actually see what the hotels & resorts look like... Not just the hotels professional photos. Makes it easier when choosing a place to stay.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-13 5
This app has a very detailed guide about everything to do or see on a visiting city. It has helped me along years of traveling! Thank you
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-12 4
Really enjoy this app. A great feature is that when you leave a review it will periodically let you know how many people have looked at your review... This really encourages you to write reviews. Great app.
Version 5.6 2011-05-23 5
Very useful and an important tool either for hard  multiple choices or for when there's even no idea from where to start from.
Version 6.6 2012-12-30 5
I love using trip advisor to create an itinerary for my trips. This app makes it all the more user friendly, as I also love using my iPhone. ;)
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 5
Love this app!!! Been using trip advisor for years, before there was even apps, and to be able to have it on the go while traveling is great!
Version 5.4 2011-04-21 5
Information about all most anything, from hotels, restaurants, popular activities, to the must-do's right in the palm of your hand.
Version 5.92 2012-02-20 5
Love this app!  So convenient to look places up and then read reviews and then map to get to them!  Huge help when planning or going on vacation/business trips!
Version 6.1 2012-05-06 5
We are frequent travelers and never stay anywhere without checking the reviews on trip advisor app first!
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 4
Almost a perfect alternative to the web site. I would have given it 5 stars only if it goes back to the page I was after switching to other apps then come back to it.
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
My mom n I r driving from Ohio to Colorado and the trip advisor app has helped us find places to stay and different restaurants to try. The "near me now" feature is awesome!
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
Trip Advisor has made its self even more portable. Accurate info you can trust. But did you expect any less from such a great company?
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
What can I say, this app is awesome! My family and I used it doing our trip to Vegas and it showed us other places to go besides the strip. We enjoyed ourselves thanks to this app!!!!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-23 5
Great product with excellent global coverage (at least where I have been). Strong validation so you don't get a lot of wacky reviews.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-11 5
I love Tripadvisor and this app has come in so handy for planning vacations and also helping us make last minute plans while on vacation.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
The tripadvisor app is a well thought out app. It's easy to use and has a pretty thorough list of hotels and restaurants with the corresponding reviews from people. Well done
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
I travel ALOT for work I'm always on the road in different places this app makes things like hotels and places to eat super easy to find
Version 8.3 2013-12-30 5
Excellent for finding places of interest at your destination, love the map with the attractions and the routing via google maps
Version 5.91 2012-01-28 5
I always check with Tripadvisor when I am traveling. It has the most complete coverage and the ratings are usually accurate.

Love this app, check it out on a regular basis for restaurants, hotels, activities. 
Extremely helpful to get reviews from fellow travelers.

I use this app to look on the next destination trip and read reviews about hotels and tourist location and learned a lot from it
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
This is one of the best apps ever!  It is so user friendly and breaks everything down into categories so that whatever info you're looking for is easier than ever to find.  Love it!
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5
This app has saved me from some horrible hotel stays!  It also helped me find some great gems. Thanks!
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 5
This app is an invaluable resource. It really has helped us to get more out of trips and even around home! Highly recommended.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
I use my trip advisor app all the time. It's very useful for finding my destination and allows for easy review entry for me as well.
Version 4.1 2010-02-10 2
I'm glad TripAdvisor is developing iPhone apps, but this is a weak first effort.  Where's the social aspect of the Local Picks Facebook app?  Where are the detailed ratings of food, service, etc?  City rankings?  Nothing is in this App except the name of the restaurant and location mapping.  Also, the first restaurant I looked up had the wrong address attached!  Needs work!
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 2
I don't know where all the 5-star ratings are coming from. The search feature is terrible. It's good only for searches in your immediate area. When I searched an area I'm traveling to, it did not mark my location. I had no point of reference for the area restaurants. It looks great but, unfortunately, hasn't been a benefit to me at all. Good thing I didn't have to buy it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5
We use local picks to find restaurant when we travel. So far we have not been disappointed. We always add our two cents in also. Great app!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-28 5
Love this app!!!! My Hubby & I were wanting a little getaway close to home for our 24th Anniversary & this app was perfect to make my hotel plans through!
Version 5.6 2011-05-25 5
This app is a must have for planning any trip, any where!  Or even looking for a new place for dinner or for something different to do locally!  <3 Trip Advisor!
Version 6.0 2012-03-30 5
I recently installed this App on my IPad 2 and have not regretted it! It is easy to use and offers a variety of neat features. The new version has excellent features. No problems.
Version 6.2 2012-07-10 4
This app isn't to bad once you get use how it is setup.  Now I can enter my reviews while on the road so I don't forget what I want to write about.  Would recommend since its free and useful.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
I use this frequently especially when traveling to find reliable food and fun options.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-11 5
Presently on vacation and TripAdvisor has been exceptionally useful in identifying good places to eat. Starting to rely on it more & more.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
We use the recommendations regularly to find restaurants during our travels. We are rarely disappointed. Need I say more?
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 5
Trip Advisor is the must have travel companion! It's even a lot of fun to rate you're local restaurants, hotels, & recreational hang outs. Couldn't live without this app.
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
I love how simple this app is. Already have found it useful in planning an upcoming trip for myself and another family members getaway... Lol!
Version 5.7 2011-08-09 5
Great app.  Very helpful reviews and photos.  Maps are clear and easy to follow.  Gave me exactly the info I need for my upcoming trip plus more.  Love this app
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 4
TripAdvisor is the next best thing to actually traveling! Reviews are honest, and accurate. And the app itself gives a quick and convenient way to access information while one is on the road. Great app!
Version 6.6 2013-01-07 5
I will never leave the house again without looking at this app.
My vacation was better than I could have hoped for thanks to trip advisor
Version 6.6 2013-01-22 5
If you like Trip Advisor, then you will like the app. Just remember apps do not completely replace full sites.
Version 5.8 2011-08-30 2
The app would be great if it performed better. Frequent crashes, stalls, etc., and also a UI that isn't as useful as the TA website, led me to give up and use Yelp instead. It's a great idea, but having a mobile experience that's so much worse than the website seems like a real problem for a service of this nature. (Referring to both iPhone and iPad apps).
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 5
Love using trip advisor when i travel always very useful and pretty accurate
Now 300 words description is too long in some cases.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Information is easily accessible and the ratings and reviews give confidence when booking new adventures.
Version 5.91 2013-12-28 5
I use this site every time I travel and to learn about new places nearby. I consider it my most useful travel/dining app by far.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
I travel a great deal for Business and TripAdvisor is one of my first locations to visit.

The hotel reviews are very helpful and the ratings are very accurate.  I have come to trust TripAdvisor as a very credible source for travel reviews.
Version 5.92 2012-02-07 5
I. Ever go to a hotel before checking tripadvisor reviews. This app makes it easier than going to their website
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 4
A good tool for guiding you when your traveling. I tried to write a review for a new restaurant in University Place that is called Boathouse 19. I was unable to do this because the search tool could not bring it up.
Version 6.6 2012-11-17 5
This is the one stop you need to make before going anywhere. App is easy to use and gets you the details quickly.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-19 5
I love this app. I used it all last week while in DC to find restaurants and sites that may be off the beaten path and it was key!
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
I love Trip Advisor. Now I have it available in an accessible and functional app. Never had the time to log on and write reviews. This makes it so much easier. Cool app!
Version 5.93 2012-03-04 5
We have planned several trips and found the collaborative nature of Trip Advisor gave us good feedback as we planned a family vacation.
Version 5.93 2012-03-11 5
I use this tool to help get answers to questions from real people who have been there and done that, highly recommend
Version 5.6 2011-06-08 5
This has to be one of my favorite apps for things to do, hotels and restaurants it has never let me down. We just used it for a restaurant in Cap Ferrat and it was delicious
Version 5.9 2011-12-04 5
This app actually works great. You can quickly get the review you're looking for. Start downloading now! :)
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-31 5
I love Trip Advisor and recommend it to everyone.  I love to check and see what other people say about places before I go.  Word Of Mouth in an app 24/7!
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 5
In many ways the app is better than the site, especially searching for food and attractions near a location. A must for international travel!
Version 6.1 2012-04-24 5
As a regular user on my computer, i'm thrilled to use the mobile app. Will definitely put it to good use in my upcoming 2 vacations to mexico this year!
Version 6.2 2012-07-04 5
Has made planning our vacation so much easier. I look forward to using it anytime I travel!
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Never travel without checking other people's experiences!
Version 6.4 2012-08-24 5
I use this almost everyday but especially when we are on the road. It has helped us new restaurants that we would have missed other wise.
Version 6.1 2012-04-04 5
Love this app! Took a road trip to savannah,found hotels and Restaraunts all the way. Saw the logo on the door and felt confident walking in! Will definitely  recommend this app.!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
Whenever I want to travel I can always refer to this app to give me ideas on where to go and what to do! I strongly recommend you get it.
Version 5.8 2011-08-15 5
Took a trip trip to central new York, had know idea what to do out here. This app made it very easy and fun to find things for me and my family. This is a travel must.
Version 5.8 2011-10-04 5
Such an intuitive app that it must be molded by real travellers instead of cave bound, natural light deficient programming slaves. 

Well done!
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
Very easy to navigate and find what you're looking for.  Really useful looking for dining and lodging options while on the road.
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
I'm So much more prepared for the type of visit I'll experience because of the resources this app offers.  Easy to navigate!  A must have app for anyone who travels.
Version 6.1 2012-04-04 2
Much less user friendly than on computer. Trying to find a hotel rating for a specific hotel in Jacksonville and I have to look up each one individually  and then go back and enter  the entire thing again and still haven't found it . Give me a list of a specific brand of hotel that I can see all of and go back and forth with.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 3
Trip Advisor is like asking for info from friends, shopkeepers and truck and cab drivers-- quality of reviews depends on the standards and experience of the reviewers. But as more people participate you can see trending
 and thus it is more reliable.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
It's like having a pocket full of travel agents. Full of great local information and tips for the traveller.
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5
I used this app to plan my vacation to Nova Scotia. While we were there, I used it to locate restaurants. I think having this information was very helpful.
Version 5.8 2011-09-08 5
I am a huge TA fan and use it as a research tool very often. I also carefully write my own revues about what I feel others would want or need to know.
Version 8.2 2013-12-08 5
I use this app anytime we have travel plans as I rely on the reviews to help us make travel decisions as to where to stay, visit, etc.
Version 6.1 2012-05-25 5
We use trip advisor for EVERYTHING we do! While on the go or from home we don't book a reservation until we check out restaurants and hotels on trip advisor
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 5
Im about to finish my honey moon, been all over Asia, and Road tripped almost all California, this app has everithing!! Just Great.
Version 8.2 2013-11-30 5
This is a great app when you are traveling! We have used it for many purposes and have always found the review ms to be very helpful!
Version 5.5 2011-04-27 3
Good app - it provides almost everything that the website does, except you can't email links to other people or bookmark favorites. Not very helpful if you're planning a trip. Definitely still using the website even on my iPhone.
Version 5.8 2011-10-09 5
This mobile app actually performs better than the website. Highly functional!
Version 5.92 2012-02-15 5
I love the map feature which enables me to see exactly where my hotel is along with the star rating and price ranges.  Travel made easy!
Version 6.1 2012-05-06 5
I just want to say thank you for all, the website team, contributors and all who works on being honest to assist others.
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 5
Great app for anyone traveling, where to stay, what to eat, what to do, all you need in one stop. All with reviews from people who have experienced all.
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
Love how you can save your favs and slide through photos.  Makes things much faster than the regular website.
Version 6.2 2012-06-20 5
I use this app all of the time! Basically like a comfortable shoe, I wouldn't want to travel anywhere without it.
Version 6.4 2012-08-27 5
This App is great and easy to use.  I've used it three times this summer and it helped me save money.   Also you get to review many choices and compare them.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-15 5
I love eating at the Manhattan Deli every time we come to Atlantis Casino in Reno.  They give you a lot of food for such a great price. Staff is always friendly.
Version 8.3 2014-01-09 5
I'm a frequent TripAdvisor contributor and I use it to check reviews for our many travels. Great app for both.
Version 5.6 2011-07-09 5
Now that I've used this app I don't think I'll take another trip without checking here first. No need to go anywhere uniformed (or forewarned) ever again.
Version 8.2 2013-12-07 4
4 stars. 

All good except for confusion with Back button being located at bottom left instead of top left which takes you back to the main page.
Version 8.3 2014-01-02 5
Used for restaurants and hotels to find the best options and has been spot on accurate so far.  Will continue to use and recommend to others

I come to Trip Advisor whether I'm gong to a restaurant down the street or to a destination 1000s of miles away!  I trust the recommendations to give me the best info.
Version 6.5 2012-09-13 5
My friend introduced me to the site and come to find out there is an amazing app. So easy and helpful to use, wouldn't think of using anything else!
Version 6.6 2014-03-17 5
The best web site for finding unbiased reviews and unedited pics of hotels and resorts is now a great app that doesn't disappoint. Quick and helpful
Version 5.8 2011-08-13 5
Makes using Trip Advisor on iPad a breeze--much easier than using Safari and the TA web site. and you really can't beat the price, can you?
Version 6.1 2012-05-02 5
This app is so helpful and quick! Great way to see photos and narrow down your search to your top hotels. Definitely get!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
Appears to be very useful and user friendly. We plan to go to Washington. There is a ton of things to do there and the app will help to sort things out.
Version 6.4 2012-09-14 4
Helped me find top rated hotels and food fast and got me in the right direction. My #1 trip go to app. Didn't give it a 5 cause some of the pics were missing, but I assumed the places were not good. I like this app a lot.
Version 6.6 2012-10-17 5
Since my wife is fearful of going to unknown locations.  This app puts her at ease to travel out of her comfort zone.
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
Its a "must have" app for any traveler, just full of useful info, that also provides local commentary. Well done!
Version 5.7 2011-07-30 5
Trip Advisor IPad ap makes trip planning a breeze. All the travel, lodging and things-to-do information right at your fingertips. I recommend it highly.
Version 5.7 2011-07-25 4
This app in invaluable when traveling and having to make spot decisions on where to stay, eat and do.  Keep the reviews real folks, have reasonable expectations, and this will continue to be a great tool.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
Excellent application -- thank you!  Obviously the developers used it when they developed it.  The GPS function is fabulous!
Version 5.9 2011-12-28 5
What a great app! My wife and I have been able to find some of the best restaurants in some of the most obscure places, thanks to this app. Thank you!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-03 5
I check everything w/ Trip Advisor. I have learned about what to see and do. I check out the local cuisine, butaiy I use it for attractions
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 5
We just got back and this little joint was amazing. Get the roasted tomatoes! Bunches of flavors, I got the beef stew (good) and was envying my wife's tenderloin. The melbec was excellent too.
Version 5.8 2011-10-25 5
I love this app I'm practically on it everyday! It helps me plan for upcoming vacations or when I can't go I live by everyone else's trip reports.
I highly recommend.
Version 6.3 2012-07-31 5
Used it the first time for spontaneous trip to Cleveland, Ohio. Found my hotel and attractions through it, good and close by restaurants too. Great app for travelers!
Version 5.5 2011-05-05 5

Version 5.8 2011-10-14 3
There seems to be no way to suggest or input restaurants, hotels, etc.  I find this unfortunate as it keeps users in the dark regarding some really great establishments that only the locals are privy to.

It is quite apparent that this database is sorely lacking.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Love this app. Just like the website. Only problem is it sometimes kicks me off for no reason. It doesn't happen often enough for me to be too worried.
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 5
I always rely on Trip Advisor on my computer. Nice to have a version that's mobile too. This app has worked just fine for me so far.
Version 5.9 2012-01-15 5
Fantastic. If you a looking for an excellent neighborhood chinease with a splash of sushi... This is the place. We eat there at least once a week and the food is delicious on a consistent basis!  Enjoy.
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 5
All if the features of the full site PLUS an on-the-go "near me" option to help find nearby restaurants and activities. Akin to Yelp, but Yelp didn't work in Prague.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 1
Will not let me login with Facebook, when clicking on FB login button, nothing happens; Will not let me post reviews, receive error message that I must login which according to settings, I'm already logged in; If I click login button on the error message, I'm directed to the Google Maps app...really?  Have no idea what TA is up to but after last up is nothing short of dreck.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
This app is so easy to use and very helpful. It makes you want to get out more just so you can review new places!
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 5
This is THE best, most comprehensive tool for travel!  And so easy to use...  Access to tons of great information, photos, reviews, maps, and 360 views.  Just perfect for travel!
Version 5.8 2011-10-25 5
This app has really been useful. I have used it to see reviews, book hotels and find places to eat. Highly recommend.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 4
Used selectively, Trip Advisor is always a helpful trip planning aid. The mobile version is especially handy for "in the field" decisions about hotels, restaurants and activities.
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 5
One of my favorite apps. Use it all the time. Reviews are usually right on the mark for most everything you encounter on the road.
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 5
Of restaurants and hotels, although I do disagree with some reviews, both positive and negative.  But if I choose to not heed the review, at least I know it's not TripAdvisor's fault.
Version 3.0 2009-08-09 4
Used in travels to France and Spain. Do not leave home without it. Excellent way to search most popular restaurants, closest restaurants,reviews were great, mapping functionality was excellent. Helped us a find a tremendous restaurant in Barcelona.
Version 5.6 2011-06-07 5
Love love love this app.   I've been using it all week while on vacation.  Hasn't steered me wrong yet!   Lots of info right at your fingertips and very user friendly.
Version 5.8 2011-09-25 5
It is so nice to have travel insight and at a moments... Planned my last trip to Mallorca and Ibiza via TripAdvisor and cannot wait to plan my next trip!
Version 7.1 2013-07-16 1
Great app to start out with, spent hours planning an upcoming vacation with great photos ands reviews from the app. However, when I updated the app which was supposed to fix bugs, it deleted all my saved items that I had spent hours looking for. Will not be using the app again. Absolutely horrible update. Maybe they should fix all the bugs next time and not delete the users plans.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
I love this app. I use it whenever I take a trip as my trip resource guide. All the reviews have been so helpful and I have never been disappointed. Thank you trip advisor.
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 5
I love to use this app. I accompany my husband on his business trips, and Trip Advisor is spot on! Easy to use, and I love to be able to read current (and past) reviews.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
very helpful in trip planning. reading other reviews is crucial for knowing the ins and outs of each destination.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
I love this app, works in all my favorite cities. And the huge selection of restaurants is amazing!!!
Trial and error in trying those places is fun!!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 5
This is the best app ever for finding good restaurants, hotels and things to do in other cities and countries! 

If you are a traveler this is a must have!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-07 5
This app is way better then others I've looked at, there could be improvements but nothing substantial, I love the things to do category!!!
Version 5.9 2011-11-11 4
Great app, but kind of buggy when you start up, however it is all good from there ....intuitive, connected and easy to use.
Further to this tripadvisor is the best , I do not travel without consulting it..
Version 5.9 2011-12-23 5
I love to get the most out of my travel experience, and trip advisor helps me do this. I have used the website for years, now this app makes it easy on the go.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Great app, easy to use and plenty of reviews. Using it to plan a trip to the DC area this summer and I've learned which places to avoid. Thanks!
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
Insightful reviews, intuitive app and all around informative. One of the best travel apps on the market.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 3
Nice app.  Hate how while adding a favorite it loses it's place and I have to scroll through everything I already viewed.  Why can't I just scroll through none stop?  The viewing in landscape only is dumb!  

Even with the few downfalls, impressive app.
Version 8.3 2014-01-05 5
all you need while traveling.
Follow specific reviewer for more accurate results.
New App is much better!
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 5
Love this app as I travel a lot.  Good info, great street views, and directions.  It makes finding a place to go easy when you are not familiar with the town.  Is also GREAT for foreign travel!
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 5
Trip Advisor is simply amazing! I can find information about restaurants, attractions, maps, about anywhere! Very easy to use!
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 5
Great travel tool but read several reviews as the comments are VERY individual and mood driven. At times it's very hard to get a real feel for the destination...
Version 5.92 2012-02-02 5
Great tool to find restaurants while traveling.  Have used it in Spain and Italy with great success.  Wouldn't leave for a trip without it and it's great for pre-departure research
Version 6.6 2012-10-01 5
Let others real experiences, prepare you in advance, every time.  For dining, travel, and entertainment, Trip Advisor, is the best friend you can count on!
Version 8.3 2013-12-30 5
I can't imagine traveling without using this app before and during my trip
Version 5.8 2011-10-03 5
I booked my b&b's and have eaten at restaurants rated highly by your app!  You haven't steered me wrong yet!  Thank you!
Version 6.6 2012-10-04 5
We have used this app for everything when we travel. Almost 5 years now and it hasn't let us down 1 time! 

Thanks a bunch!
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 5
This is an amazing app that has been updated to show maps of attractions now. This is a must for any serious explorer.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-06 5
I use this app when out of town & when in at home, looking for a new restaurant to try! Never disappoints.
Version 5.6 2011-06-07 5
I am a big fan of Trip Advisor, love that you get current, local reviews & advice instantly!  I use it every time I travel & even when I'm not traveling just for kicks!
Version 5.8 2011-10-09 5
This app is very user friendly. 
I will use it to help me when 
I plan our vacation next year 
to Hawaii and a Bike and
Barge trip to Germany in 2012.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
I enjoy using this app. I do alot of traveling, and this is very convenient and easy to use. I wish I could use my profile to write reviews.
Version 5.6 2011-06-09 5
I used it before my Boston trip, and I got some important tips...
It is strongly recommend to any iPad frequent traveling users..

Thanks,
Hesham
Version 5.8 2011-08-19 5
Very quick and easy interface - convenient contact options. Definitely recommend if traveling outside the country!
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
Easy to use, fun to navigate. It's nice to be able to review a location right after you leave. It saved the last info I tied to enter before I lost Internet access,so that's a plus.
Version 6.1 2012-05-05 5
I always check this app when going to any trip. I select the places i want to go see and save my locations so i don't forget.  Very helpful!
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 5
This is so handy to know what local place to eat or stay. Love hearing from real people who travel and share their experiences. Love this app
Version 6.2 2012-07-11 5
This app was awesome to find hotels and things to do wherever we went!!  My only suggestion would be the ability to sort alphabetically.
Version 6.6 2013-01-22 5
Gives you insight into places, hotels, & restaurant.  I especially like that I can look at reviewers' other reviews to see if their tastes are similar to mine.
Version 6.6 2013-03-09 5
I really like this app! Very accurate when it comes to prices.. Booked my first flight through Trip Advisor yesterday!! Thanks!
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
Using it often, recommendation is good, but find really worthy place is difficult through it.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
I never plan a trip or eat at a new restaurant without checking Trip Advisor. I also use Flip Key to rent houses. Excellent travel site.
Version 8.5 2014-03-04 5
I use trip advisor all the time for eating out when traveling and at home. It's fun to look at local places you have never eaten at and then go to them.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 2
I downloaded this app a couple of weeks ago looking forward to using the augmented reality feature integrated with Google maps for finding nearby restaurants. I downloaded an update and suddenly both are gone. Worse than that they switched to Bing, which is absolutely useless for finding your way around. Very disappointed.
Version 6.4 2012-08-19 5
Always the straight scoop on everything so far. Between Trip Advisor, Facebook and Yelp. You should never have a bad trip anywhere.
Version 6.1 2012-05-26 5
Excelent app. Very useful and informative when traveling and around to find good restaurants.....highly recommended!
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 5
I love having this App. Now instead of going on the web, I can quickly look things up and use my location!!! It's great!
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 5
Very informative app. Like the ability to find things around you quick.
Version 6.4 2012-09-08 5
Wonderful app !  Industry could learn more from visitor reviews than some expensive hospitality consultant
Version 8.5 2014-03-25 5
I use this at for every vacation. It helps me choose where to go, how to get there, and even lets me tell others how I feel about it. It is a MUST when traveling!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
Downloaded this App yesterday for an unexpected trip and it helped me find a hotel and restaurants. Very user friendly. A keeper!!!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-01 1
It's been my experience apps like these that promise "fair and unbiased" reviews are neither. A point of fact; negative reviews of restaurants seem to magically disappear from this site and any such app that does that should raise an armada of red flags. Take their data with a half a grain of salt. I've tried places that have been featured using their "fair and unbiased" criteria. Let's just say someone is loading the cart with A LOT of BS.
Version 6.3 2012-07-22 5
I travel many countries in Asia and middle east and all info espeacially about Hotels I got from this site were acurate and useful.
Version 6.6 2013-01-31 5
This is great for checking out hotels on the fly... Like when you are on the road looking for a place to stay. Easy to read the reviews.
Version 6.6 2013-03-25 5
I love this app - it's so easy to use and is my go to travel app - I also write alot of reviews and the app makes it very easy to do so I don't have to log onto my PC! Love it!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
I've found that in general the ratings and reviews match my experience.  Plus the site is easy to navigate to get what I want.  Great job!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-24 5
Never plan a trip without first consulting tripadvisor for hotels, attractions and even private housing options
Version 8.2 2013-12-19 5
I use this app so often, both reading other reviews and adding my own. 
It's a great source of information.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-06 5
I read reviews and review places I have been all the time. Sharing the info and tips saves me a lot of time and money for minimal effort.
Version 5.92 2012-02-20 5
I think this app is easier to use then the PC website.  It always sorts by the top rating which I sometimes have trouble finding on the website.
Version 6.1 2012-06-11 3
I love Trip Advisor and use it extensively as I travel around the world. It is a huge help when I'm searching for reviews on hotels and restaurants. My only criticism is that I ha no access to my profile on my iPad. When that is fixed (if ever) the 3 stars will become 5.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 4
Great app but I wish it could sort and/or rate based on which meal you would like for restaurants. I would like to find a great breakfast place but can't tell which is the best breakfast place.
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 5
We are frequent travelers and use this app to find fun things to do. I no longer research "things to do" before I leave. I simply use Trip Advisor once I arrive.
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
I got this app for our motorcycle trip around the Midwest and Canada.  We had no certain plans, so this app came in handy finding hotels and places to see.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-10 5
I always read people's review before I go to a restaurant or booking a hotel. Don't wanna your vocation be ruined by terrible food or crappy hotels? Use this!
Version 8.5 2014-03-04 4
This app has been reliable and quick.  It has missed a couple of good deal found on others but overall it has been good.  A good start on your search for the perfect trip.
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 4
Very helpful, I like the fact that I'm able to save the restaurants I want to visit in my city to city travels. Also, consumer reviews are very informative in deciding which hotels i would like to stay.
Version 5.92 2012-02-20 5
Is a pretty solid application I will be using for my indecisiveness on where to eat. I feel like a food critic but with less snobbiness and with useful information
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
I need this app. I don't go in a store or restaurant before checking with the reviews they have. Then being able to go straight to a map also! Great.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5
I wouldn't go on a trip and go to a restaurant or book a hotel without checking trip advisor first. Must have!
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-07 3
Fairly good app, only thing though, how many freaking updates does it need? By the time you read this it'll probably be around 10.7.5 update or something like that, it has an update to it practically everyday, its really annoying if your like me.
Version 5.6 2011-06-22 5
On vacation in Florida with the iPad and needed and app to find eats and things to do--this app was much, much better than doing the google thing!  Won't go on vacation without it!
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
Just discovered this app last month and it is quickly becoming my favorite app.
Version 5.8 2011-09-08 4
Just downloaded the app and loving it already ... So easy to use and I like the pictures...
Only one thing: I can't check the availability of the rooms... Or maybe I just didn't try yet lol
Version 5.92 2012-01-31 5
This is a wonderful app that allows you insight to millions of hotels all over the world. User friendly, convenient, honest and informative. Must have!
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 4
I use it all the time on my iPhone and iPad and love it.
It's easy, quick and helpful when traveling to new areas.
My only wish is that the app could also link to you Trip Advisor home page and maps/profile.
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 5
I would never book a room again before checking Tripadvisor.
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 5
This app is my most used app! I can get info on just about everywhere I go, loved it on my comp and  happy to carry it where I go, good job!!!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
I use this app all the time to research my hotel option.  So far it has work like a charm. Easy to navigate and very efficient.
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 5
We never travel anywhere without checking trip advisor!  So far it's the most accurate hotel rating out there!!!
Version 5.9 2012-01-04 5
Just downloaded but can believe in 5 minutes I found a hotel, explored the neighborhood with the street view and planned out our first day!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-17 5
Great app for finding specifics and I love that they list what number the business is out of the same type if businesses in the same area!
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
Seamless and fast.  Great information about out of the way locations too.
Highly Recommend
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 4
A must. However i dont find the rank numbers very trustful. You must read the reviews and look at photos and then choose places according to the kind of trip you are doing
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 5
Love this app.  Great for checking out restaurants locally or for where to eat, stay and what to do when traveling.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
If you are traveling 10 or 1000 miles from home, you need this app. Found 2 great places to stay, and a wonderful restaurant during our trip so far.
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
Love trip advisor.....I only book travel plans based on what other travelers are saying! If the hotel gets bad reviews, I completely stay away.
Version 5.6 2011-05-20 5
I'm a big fan of TripAdvisor so of course i installed this app on my iPhone. I use it for all aspects of my trips. If it doesn't have a good rating on this site I don't even look at.
Version 6.5 2012-09-26 5
I am on middle east tour for work and staying in top-rated trip advisor hotels.  Every one of them has been excellent!

Thanks trip advisor!
Version 5.0 2010-05-09 5
This app is now the same as the website. It is very helpful for locating places like hotels and restaurants. It is a must have for me, I use the website to prepare for travel.
Version 5.8 2011-08-20 4
I just downloaded this and if I had had this app before booking my most recent trip, it would have saved me some major discomfort.  I'm looking forward to using it more soon. Good Job!
Version 5.8 2011-10-08 5
This app is great, very easy to use and all the great photos people share are great. It makes it very easy to envision how you'd enjoy the activities or places.
Version 5.9 2011-11-05 5
Checking the reviews on tripadvisor before going has saved us a ton of disappointment and given a ton of great decisions.
Version 8.5 2014-03-19 5
Must have for anyone looking for traveling advice from people that has experienced the places.
Version 8.5 2014-03-22 5
I use this app for planning trips and for quick checks for local attractions.
Version 8.2 2013-12-13 5
This was a great way for us to plan a trip to Martha's Vineyard. We found out all we needed to know before we went. Very useful app!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-10 3
I do like trip advisor but I hate when I make a comment and management can comment on my comment I should be able to comment on theirs, and I hate when I write a review and it doesn't get published even tho it fallows the rules and I get a email saying it doesn't!
Version 5.92 2012-01-20 5
Well for me this app has been very useful. I just downloaded it today and and helped me to go to a very interesting museum
And after that eat in Avery nice place.
Version 5.9 2011-12-18 4
I love trip advisor! The mobile app makes it so easy for me to find good restaurants. App would be better if I could add a restaurant from the app itself (even better if I could use location services to do it.)
Version 5.92 2012-01-29 5
Before going anywhere I always check trip advisor for helpful reviews.
Version 6.1 2012-04-18 4
I have always enjoyed being a reviewer and searching for hotels and travel on this site, but now that this app exists, it has made my life much easier, thanks!!!
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 4
Needs better addresses. Has the fix address or report bad address feature but people don't really fix addresses. The map is immensely helpful though. Got me through my vacation!
Version 5.6 2011-05-25 5
I check trip advisor before I book any hotel around the world. It has saved me from making many mistakes.
Version 5.8 2011-09-12 5
Since we got this app, we feel that we have a personal faithful excellent advisor for all of our fun time.
It is really amazing ....
Version 6.3 2012-07-22 5
We use all the time when traveling and never had an issue with the app crashing.  It works very much like the on-line version.
Version 6.6 2013-01-15 3
This app is very frustrating. Searching for anything is a pain. When you press the back button it will bring u back to the main menu and u have to enter search all over again. Love the website. Wish app was better.
Version 6.6 2013-04-14 5
I find trip advisor the only way to travel! Little secrets appear that can make it or break it when I travel! The only war to travel!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 5
Great Irish cuisine and wonderful ambience. Staff outstanding (Darren, Simon & Melissa). Coddle and fish and chips very tasty! Our favorites ! One stop in Dublin one should not miss !
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
This app is one of my favorites anywhere you go you can find something to do and even get linked to purchase options.
Version 5.9 2011-11-09 5
It has saved me money and time providing accurate information and great ideas. A must for the traveler.
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
This app helped us find wonderful little treasures we never would have found on our own while on vacation.
Version 6.1 2012-06-10 5
This app can save you alot of money by giving you access to more than one choice when searching for a hotel
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
I rely on the information travelers post here. I use this app on my iPod touch and I use the web site. Love both!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 4
What happened to showing restaurants near the hotels you are looking at??  That part was so nice when planning a trip and wanting to stay close to where we are staying.  Please bring that part back!!!!
Version 8.2 2013-12-02 5
As a very active traveller domestically and internationally, this is my most used and most dependable app on my phone!
Version 8.4 2014-02-01 4
Good app with a ton of reviews. I wish there was a way to push maps and addresses to txt or email for off line reference. Also local spelling (China) for taxis. In a size they can see/read from a phone.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 5
Just what I expected considering their website is so cool. I have always used my safari to go to website, but using this ap is so much quicker.
Version 5.7 2011-08-07 5
Use trip advisor consistently while planning on traveling, especially abroad. Has never disappointed. Awesome site!
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 5
Our recent trip to San Diego was enhanced with accurate ratings and info on attractions and restaurants in the area. Thanks Trip Advisor!
Version 8.2 2013-12-08 5
Ratings are very important. This allows you to read and decide off of other opinions if it's a good place to go on a spontaneous day.
Version 8.5 2014-02-27 5
This site has great vacation information and will generally give you good advice as you are planning your getaways!
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 5
Fantastic, especially when you travel to places unknown to your friends/colleagues/family etc.
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 5
Easy to learn, this app immediately started to improve our travel experience. It's an ideal supplement to a travel guidebook.
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
This App is literally the idiot's guide to travel and everything else related. Describing it as "user-friendly" wouldn't do it nearly amount of justice deserved.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
Have used this app locally/nationally/internationally. Just be aware of 'planted' reviews.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-22 5
Much better after latest update, had trouble saving reviews until updated!
Version 8.3.1 2014-03-29 3
When the user "experience" was redesigned a few versions ago it became Painfully Slow. I still use the app but I have also started using yelp more because of the poor redesign. Perhaps it it because of my old iPhone 4g.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
Super usefull! I can't stop finding helpful tips. Usually use it to find references of hotels and restaurants while planning or enjoying a visit to a new destination.
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 4
It gives us a heads up on crappy motels. We try to stay in cheap but clean places. And believe me, if the place we get is bad, I'm going to let everyone on here know.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
I travel a lot for work and don't know how I did it before this app.  It gives reviews of hotels and places to eat among other things.  Love it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 5
This will be a great vacation spot for families once the resort opens the first of 2014. Went fishing there yesterday with my kids and had a great time.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-15 5
We use this often and appreciate others who take time to rate places and food.
Version 4.1 2010-04-02 4
please add a wish list that Alerts you when you are within a certain distance defined by the user.  There are times I am in an area and don't think to look up a place it would be nice if you could get an alert
Version 6.2 2012-06-29 5
Thanks for app like this one , I could make all my reservation easy and fast. Previous checking prices and reviews.
Version 5.7 2011-07-14 4
I have been using this for three trips now, the app is good! It's nice in that the ratings are based on real people and not computerized (or so it seems). Does seem to have some inconsistant ranking in some lists though.
Version 5.8 2011-10-15 5
I belonged to TA before I ever had a smartphone. Love the fact that I can now access information as I travel and can give reviews before I return home.
Version 5.9 2011-11-24 5
This app is great for people looking to find something to do in a new city. I moved to kansas city recently and I found things I would of never known with this app
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 4
We have had a new restaurant in the place of Ameci Pizzeria for last 2 years but the info hasn't been updated on this app.  With this said, I love the info you get about any place with such great ease.
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
I started using this app long before I joined TA. I now love writing reviews and getting other reviews before I go to do anything.  Great application.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 4
I can save my preferred hotels etc on my iPhone but there's no place to save on the iPad. You can see your previously saved ones, but can't add. 

Lame. Other than that, great app.
Version 5.8 2011-08-30 5
Helped us with on the go information (particularly hotels and restaurants)  everywhere across the country during a 6000 mile road trip across the USA
Version 6.1 2012-04-24 5
If you're a traveler or just a curious about hotel prices and what to do in town, you must download this app. I strongly recommend!
Version 8.0 2013-10-16 5
My family travels ALL the time and this app has been a life saver numerous times! I use it for everything now :)! Highly recommend!!!
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 5
I don't book anything without checking the reviews on TripAdvisor first! They have never been wrong. Intuitive app; highly recommend!
Version 5.7 2011-07-08 5
Provides personal insight to travel locations and their attractions, really helpful to find something that interests you specifically
Version 5.92 2012-02-04 5
This is a great application.  Traveling thru Malibu and used recommendation from trip advisor to go to the best restaurant on the beach. Felt like we were in Greece on the beach
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
It's a great app! Makes it so much easier to find a great place to eat or stay, and saves you from disappointment and/or a bad experience.
Version 6.6 2012-11-18 5
I like the reviews. It's easy to submit reviews too, but I wish the app wouldn't crash when I try to submit more than one pic.
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 5
My most used app.  Love that I can find out the low down on places from people who have actually been there.
Version 5.9 2011-12-01 5
My go-to app when traveling. I check the reviews here before staying anywhere or doing anything!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
I use this to check on what people are saying about hotels, restaurants, etc... Gives me an idea in what hotels to check into!
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
Love this app! Great way to get info when googling places is not very successful. The forums are great and has good info on hotels, restaurants, and things to do.
Version 6.5 2012-09-25 5
I have been using TA for years, so I jut wanted to app to present the same info in an easy format for my phone. This does the trick.
Version 6.6 2013-02-03 5
I have used trip advisor on several trips- its reviews and recommendations have been an excellent compass to more enjoyable experiences.
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 4
Been doing a lot of traveling in the states this year and this app has definitely been helpful!  Easy to use which is reflected in the number and breadth of comments on so many places.
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
Trip Advisor is indispensable on the PC and now with this app. Ratings and reviews nearly always right on. If you travel you need this.
Version 6.6 2013-04-04 5
Able to check prices, info on hotels, flights as well as vacation sites. Almost as easy as full site. User friendly
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
This app is very helpful for an infrequent traveler. I travel once in a while for work, this app helps me find good local restaurants.
Version 5.91 2012-03-26 5
Super useful tool to get real-world info on hotels & restaurants.  Love it.  I also like the interface that helps me figure out where I ate based on location (for when I forget the name).
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-07 5
For me, still working fine. I can do almost everything from the original web site. Simple, soft and good!
Version 5.6 2011-06-15 5
Lots of ways to sort.  Check out "live view" for a way to have ratings while you walk using your camera and gps to identify where you are.
Version 6.6 2013-01-10 5
While traveling there is no better tool. Travel guide is also extremely useful as the GPS will work even if you have no Internet.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 5
So very helpful.  Already booking hotels and researching sites to see!  Nice to see comments from others!
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 5
This is just the most useful tool for finding all the best- cheapest-nicest or avoiding the worst- priciest.... Thanks to all who have gone before!
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
Just downloaded and first using for a weekend getaway. I love the ratings info for the sites to see. I would have missed great things.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-11 5
Outstanding selection, a variety of first hand opinions and independent comments and advice.  What could be better?
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 5
I have been a big fan of Trip Advisor since it's inception for vacation planning. Now I have it conveniently on my I Pad. Can't wait to test it out "on location"
Version 6.4 2012-08-20 5
Literally everything you can think of. It's mapquest, Expedia, and leisure planning all in one.
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
Very easy to use. Have had no problems since downloading. Love it because I'm always looking for places to travel.
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 5
Wow. This is optimized specifically for the iPad. Great interface and very intuitive. I find it much easier to use and navigate than the standard website.
Version 5.8 2011-09-12 5
So super helpful and informative. Saved us a lot of trouble getting a heads up from previous travlers. I won't go unless I read the reviews!
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
I travel a lot around the world and trip advisor has made it so much easier and more fun. Wouldn't go anywhere without it.
Version 6.1 2012-06-09 4
The app is great! Love looking at pictures, reviews, and photos of places near me.  The app works fast too!  I would give this app 5 stars if it had a link to all the restaurants menus.
Version 6.6 2012-11-18 5
Whether your in your home town or traveling trip advisor is the best app/ website out there to determine what to do and what to expect!
Version 6.6 2013-04-07 5
Used the Trip Advisor app during my entire two week vacation to Satellite Beach, Florida, New Orleans and Nashville. Thanks to TA we ate in the best restaurants and drank in the best bars. Thanks TA!
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 5
Learned our lesson last year about not checking TripAdvisor for eating out on vacation. And now that I have my smartphone, this truly the best app ever!
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 5
Love tripadvisor both as a reviewer and a reviewee!  Tells us where to stay and where not to, and where to eat and where to avoid.  Excellent app!
Version 5.92 2012-01-23 5
Really honest from users and easiest to navigate back and forth. We use everywhere, Beijing to Marfa 

Wife will not go without this first
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
I have used this app on countless occasions....and have never been disappointed.  My iPod allows me to view topics in a readable format!  Love, love, love it!
Version 5.7 2011-08-09 5
I am a heavy user of trip advisor so this app was exactly was I needed. The best feature is the maps as they are clear, and exactly where you need them.
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 3
Ever time you add a fab to your list it scrolls back to the beginning-very annoying...especially if there are 800+ attractions to the city you want to visit. However, the info to sites, links to the corresponding websites & ability to book from the app are nice.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-19 5
This is one of the few apps that I can say is truly as good if not better than the main web site. Very easy to use and navigate around in.
Version 8.5 2014-03-26 5
Whenever I travel I always look at the reviews on Trip Advisor. I feel I'm getting the reviews of people like me. I feel I can trust the reviews in Trip Advisor.
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 4
Love this app. Only issue I see is that as you are writing reviews from your mobile device (iPod), you cannot easily scroll back up in the text boxes.  Otherwise very helpful and easy to use!
Version 5.7 2011-07-03 5
This is a perfect counterpart to the paper travel guides I'm using to plan my honeymoon! It's especially nice having instant access to the traveler reviews of restaurants, hotels, and attractions!
Version 5.8 2011-10-25 5
This is a great app! I can't believe it's free too! Great info and nice user experience allows you to easily browse destinations, and enjoy planning trips!!!
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 5
This app its amazing and helpfull as the site. Helps to find nice hotels arround the world and keep away from bad places.
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
Such a handy companion to the invaluable website!!  Insightful reviews from fellow travelers.  I love how attractions, hotels and restaurants are ranked.
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
Extremely useful, give you any directions of hotels and restsurants including reviews.
Version 6.4 2012-09-01 5
Went to visit Istanbul an used the app for restaurants a lot and was happy all the time. 
Very useful even without Internet service.
Version 6.2 2012-09-26 5
I use it all the time to decide where to eat or stay! It has generally been spot on.  Thank you trip advisor.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-08 4
Great for on the road reviews and info while traveling, love to use while out of town or at the house to get info on places to eat, go check out, or if you're planning a trip.
Version 8.1.1 2013-12-01 4
It works great for the most part. I wonder why the website information is not listed for any of the activities/attractions. That makes it quite difficult to know more about an attraction.
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
All you need to know in one place for home or travel makes this a great app! Love that you can see reviews of places at destinations your traveling at.
Version 6.4 2012-08-21 5
We've been using the Trip Advisor app for our Alaskan holiday--it's been extremely helpful and up to date--very pleased
Version 6.4 2012-09-18 4
The app works well in general. The map widget is a little rough, but with patience you'll get it. Great when you're abroad and have wifi - a real time saver.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
Thanks to Trip Advisor I booked an amazing trip to Grand Cayman Island May 11'! Now I am traveling to Key West in a few weeks & I know Trip Advisor's app is going to come in handy! :-)
Version 5.92 2012-02-15 4
Tripadvisor is a great place to find information prior to traveling. I enjoy reading reviews of hotels, but always take each one with a grain of salt, since we all have our own tastes.
Version 5.92 2012-02-16 4
Overall an awesome app. 
The crowd sourced reviews are both helpful and authentic. 
It has trouble retaining session info when switching between apps. 
Otherwise its really nifty.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-24 5
We have started using trip advisor to find places to eat everytime we take a trip. Makes finding great food in new places a snap.
Version 8.3 2013-12-26 4
I found this app very useful on my trip to California last summer. Found some really good restaurants. I'm going to use it again on my upcoming trip to the Midwest states. Once you figure it out, it's wonderful.
Version 6.6 2013-01-29 5
Everything you are used to on the main site, in a beautifully designed UI. Well done.
Version 8.2 2013-12-08 5
tripadvisor is very good app i recommended that any one need any thing from shop to activities downloaded and enjoy it
Version 5.9 2011-12-28 5
That about says it. Am finding instant gratification in putting my praise (and displeasure) to words. Finding out others experiences is so helpful, too.
Version 6.3 2012-07-22 5
I enjoy using Trip Advisor for reading and writing reviews. A great way to get some good advice on places to see, things to do, and places to eat and stay.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-11 5
I use it all the time! Love it! Thanks for making it easy and straightforward to get the scoop! No more wasting time and money at terrible places!
Version 8.5 2014-03-25 5
Just love all the reviews and different categories to go between. My wife and I love B&b's. I've booked every B&B ever because of TA recommends. Great job
Version 5.5 2011-04-24 4
Love the app. Does everything I would expect it to do. Finds local est., gives me reviews, shows me a map....only drawback is it seems it does not give you directions from your current location. I can live with that, 4 Stars.
Version 6.1 2012-04-04 5
I love and trust Trip Advisor, have used it for the past 5 odd years and their reviews never failed me.
The app is a great add on if I cannot get to my computer.
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 1
Ap has "lost" the three main hotels I know in Iasi Romania (one of the country's major tourist destinations, a beautiful cultural center).  Get popup prompts on full site that I'll really love the new ap. Really annoying and unfair to some special businesses. Ap concept isn't "info light," just "feature light," so every popup is an aggravation. 

I'm using current OS, btw.

Why not just pull it til kinks are worked out?
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
Great for when you are on the go. Love the reviews because we don't all value the same thing in travel. Have never encountered any glitches.
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 5
Great travel app. No need to buy a travel guide from book store or waste paper printing out maps or restaurants.
Version 5.6 2011-09-10 5
Most always thoughtful reviews, not the garbage "lol dis place rulz!" stuff you will find with other rating communities.
Version 5.5 2011-04-24 5
Actual guest reviews are the best part. And the forum is so well organized. Easy to sort thru for valuable information.
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
Very nice interface and integration with maps.  There are fewer restaurants than urbanspoon, but the reviews tend to be higher quality.
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 5
You're great, awesome, fantastic. Best app since sliced bread. Now will you quit asking me to validate your worth? Where's your self esteem, anyway?
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 4
Couldn't find any reasonable reason for the portrait view to be inactive. Beside that, great and usefull app. The portrait viewing question is not that big deal, but I LIKE TO CHOOSE what I can do, even though I'm an Aplle user lol lol.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 5
The app is easy to use. I love being able to check on hotels ahead of time. Thanks to all who post.
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 5
Putting a trip together to Washington DC and this has been the most helpful tool so far. "Just googling it" wasn't doing the trip. Easy to navigate, fun to use.
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 4
Great application with easy navigation. You'll find everything you need and the reviews are a great help to choose from various options available be it restaurants, clubs, hotel rooms. Very helpful.
Version 5.8 2011-10-14 5
used this to check everything we wanted to do or try in sedona, az. didn't let us down. great way to find out what your average "Joe" thinks.
Version 6.2 2012-07-13 5
Great interface, ease-of-use... I would recommend this app to any who travel and have definite opinions of places visited.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Booked more than 50 Hotels, Restaurants, etc based on Tripadvisor Ratings so far and have never been disappointed.
Version 8.0 2013-10-19 5
Excellent website and app. I find theforumsveryhelpful when planning my travel.
Version 8.1 2013-11-08 5
Is an essential travel site never book a room without see what others say here
Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5
What a great app to do research.  Love it and use it weekly when on business trips to see the best rated restaurants etc..
Version 6.2 2012-06-15 5
Like this ap, I travel quite a bit, I have used it  everywhere that I've been. Easy to use and very informative, wouldn't want to be without  it.
Version 5.9 2011-12-26 5
Fast becoming my go-to travel app. Along with Kayak & AAA TripTip apps, there's virtually nothing I can't do to plan for my 5000 mile cross country trip. Nearly indispensable.
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
It has givin me pro results thank u and yes it work really good at telling me what is at the sertain place number of hotels, restaurants, things to do, and ext.        THANK U :)
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 5
I use ist all the time, love that people in all kinds of life situations write recessions. Depending on my current travel preferences, I can research.
Version 6.6 2012-10-03 5
We took you advice for hotel in Strasbourg, The Gutenbourg. Really impressed and can't wait for future recommendations.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
Spend some time planning a trip with this app and you will know where you are and what to do when you get there.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-25 5
Ive tried several of these types of apps and this is my fave. So far every hotel and restaurant that we reviewed as a too fave on their site became our new fave.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-06 5
I love this app.  Great tool for finding things close by.  The list of reviews are very helpful when trying to decide the best place to gp.
Version 6.4 2012-08-27 5
Definitely comes in handy when traveling and even when trying to come up with something fun to do near home!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-01 5
If you want great food, generous portions and good old hometown hospitality you must try Arnies cafe in Warrenton, Or.  Best cafe for breakfast and lunch on the North Coast.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-03 5
Doesn't matter the place or locations, you always will find some place that you can go!
Version 8.5 2014-03-11 5
We get a lot of great suggestions from Trip Advisor for restaurants and attractions that we may not have ever tried without this app.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 4
App performs well on wifi, and "near me now" makes a decent alternative to the Yelp app when traveling internationally. Map feature mostly accurate, better on wifi than data.
Version 5.6 2011-08-14 5
I truly decide on my restaurants with the reviews from this app.  I wish, however, more people would review, as some of the reviews are outdated.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
I love this app. If I want to know about a restaurant or hotel I read the reviews. It usually comes down to what other people have reviewed for my decision. Love this app
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-11 5
This is indeed a travelers guy has everything you need when traveling. It even has social network. I just love it, love it, love it. Thanks Traveler.
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 5
Easy to navigate and get some feedback of hotel guests. Some seems to be too much or not true at all... but others give good info about property and location!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-21 2
In any big city the map function needs to work well. Which it did until recently. Now I get no street at all, just lone dots on the page. I deleted and reloaded several times to no avail. As an ex-pat in Shanghai the map is crucial. I hope this is fixed soon. 

When the map is working - this is a great app.
Version 5.9 2011-11-07 5
This app is way too addictive!! I started searching for something in Cabo San Lucas and ended up spending over an hour and making my way to Brazil...
Version 5.9 2011-11-16 5
I use trip advisor all the time to read reviews and it always help me to decide on where to stay when my family travels.
Version 6.6 2012-09-29 5
It give so much in a single app, really appreciate. Not sure if something could be compared to it
Version 8.2 2014-02-05 5
Used this App to select our Dinner location today, and had a wonderful dining experience! I am a believer in ratings.
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 3
Great app but at least 1/3 of the places on here (restaurants) are closed, time to update records and actually look into people reporting things closed and wrong addresses.

Great for out of town trips and unplanned vacations other then the above mentioned.
Version 6.2 2012-07-19 4
Enjoyed a nice meal here. Didn't realize we would need reservations on a weeknight, but the hostess offered to seat us at the bar and it worked out fine. Staff were nice but not overly friendly. Food was excellent.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-23 5
I love using them, I use it for all my hotel choices while traveling . Restaurant info is very handy as well. Love this app
Version 8.5 2014-03-18 5
I don't go anywhere without looking in TA first. Also makes it easy to review places for others.
Version 2.0 2011-05-01 5
Great app if you use the website.  Very similar and very easy to find what you are looking for
Version 5.6 2011-05-17 5
Without this app I would be stuck in some dull routine. Now, I get to discover new places around me that I didn't know were great. Lots of reviews, and great pics. THANKS TRIP ADVISOR!!
Version 5.91 2012-01-15 4
I travel extensively to unfamiliar areas for work. This app makes finding simple things like restaurants easy, and I love the reviews to know which to steer clear from.
Version 6.4 2012-09-18 5
Works great, especially helpful on driving trips to see what might be ahead.
Version 5.93 2012-03-09 5
I rely on TripAdvisor to help me plan our vacations.  Love reading reviews and reading what others have to say about their experiences.  I love to contribute too.  Great site!
Version 6.6 2013-04-07 5
Fun to see where my friends have been. Reviews are helpful when in a new place. This is a very useful, informative and great app for the iPhone
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-30 5
Good to double check when traveling, this is a very reliable way to do so.
Version 5.6 2011-06-08 5
We use it to find hotels in places we are traveling to for the first time. Reviews are helpful and have been pretty accurate, in our experience.
Version 5.7 2011-07-08 5
Was used to the web version. Tried this up and I find it awesome. Not just for use at home ...great way to find and book a restaurant, but brilliant for traveling.
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 5
We use this app a bunch when we are preparing for vacation and while on vacation to find places to eat and things to do.
Version 5.9 2011-12-12 5
We love to travel to new places, and trip advisor helps us prepare for our new adventures from hearing about other peoples experiences good and bad.
Version 6.0 2012-03-13 4
With small children, it's hard to know if you are wasting money taking them to each venue. Trip advisor is the perfect tool to check the age appropriateness before you go!
Version 6.6 2013-01-12 5
TripAdvisor let's us know how we are doing through our clients candid comments. A great way to improve all the time!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
I have been a trip advisor fiend for a few years and love this app for the iPad. Makes finding spots and writing reviews very quick and easy.
Version 5.6 2011-05-26 4
Other than a few problems with search, this app works exactly as I know Trip Advisor should!  Better interface than expected too (not a trip advisor strength online).
Version 5.6 2011-06-24 5
Helps all travelers make informed decisions about where to eat, stay, and what to do to have a great time while on vacation!
Version 6.2 2012-06-11 5
Helped me find a last minute ticket when my mom had back surgery. Ticket was affordable too!
Version 6.6 2013-03-28 4
I love that I can use my iPad to plan trips and such however I wish this app also would let me manage our page for the restaurant I work for
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-01 4
Glad to find an app which can improve my capability to find new stores when on vacation. I trip along Florida and find this app great for good recommendations on restaurants. :))
Version 5.92 2012-02-16 5
I don't book a hotel without checking tripadvisor.  The app is quick and user friendly.
Version 5.93 2012-03-01 5
Trip Advisor lays everything out so that planning your trip is easy.  I trust real people and customer reviews more than star ratings.
Version 8.5 2014-03-10 4
...  Stop looking to Save from landscape view.  The option list is present in portrait view but disappears in landscape view.

Mostly a nice and useful app, otherwise.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
The user interface is clean and easy to use.  Very easy to read the reviews, which is my favorite part of Tripadvisor.
Version 8.1.1 2014-01-31 5
This by far the best travel app out there... I use this every time I travel for hotel selection and restaurants and it's never disappointed!!!   Thanks TripAdvisor
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 4
Useful when traveling, but it locks up once in a while. Need to look carefully at reviews as some people get too sentimental and loose objectivity. Very heful if you travel around a lot.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
Trip advisor is very accurate.  It helped my husband and out when we planned our trip to Maui.  Very informative.
Thank you... DJ
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
My first review took over a week to get approved but it's a useful app. and I find myself using it all the time.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
This app provides me with all the information that I need to make decisions of my travels from those that have done it before
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 4
I wish TA could give a range of prices for hotels without my putting in dates of travel.  Prices may drive when I travel but a range of prices is always helpful.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
This app has become an integral part of our trip planning, both before, during, and after.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 4
I love the website so how could I not appreciate the app!? It has been very helpful on recent trips- I would definite recommend having it if you travel, even if it isn't regularly.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-03 5
A terrific technical companion for out-of-town traveling.  Reading the reviews from fellow Trip Advisor users is very useful and helpful.
Version 6.0 2013-05-15 5
I do travel a lot for business/pleasure and I always check any new destination with Tripadvisor.
I believe it is simply great.!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-28 5
Great information on B&Bs.  They allow other traveller's reviews to guide and refine your trip.
Version 8.0 2013-10-10 5
Always consult trip advisor whether we are traveling far or near. Consistently accurate reviews and always helpful. Thanks!
Version 8.5 2014-03-02 5
Whether you're on a computer or using the app, tripadvisor will always lead you in the right direction.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 4
I gave 4 stars simply because the app lacks the function of only showing awailable hotels for specific dates. If that function is added, it is the best app for the job!
Version 5.6 2011-06-22 5
This is a very helpful and comprehensive app with useful comments and ratings.  Love the picture maps - like being there before you are.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 4
This app is very useful and helpful to us. We used it to basically plan our trip (as far as the hotels and places to eat and things such as that). I liked how it lists all of the hotels in that area, so you can see what all of the prices are. Great app.!
Version 6.2 2012-06-15 5
Accurate Reviews you can depend on. Don't make travel plans without doing your research here !  Highly recommended.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 5
Love this app!!  A must have to find honest reviews on hotels and restaurants. I use it to locate hotels when traveling or find a good local restaurant.
Version 8.2 2013-12-11 5
Wonderfully handy app while traveling! Review your faves or use as a discovery or decision too or tie breaker!
Version 5.5 2011-04-30 5
Within a couple of minutes you can use this app to find just what you're looking for. Nice when in unknown territory!
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
Great app for travel, just needs more filter criteria like website, ex best hotels for business, friends, romantic, etc.
Version 6.5 2012-09-17 5
1st place I look when planning a trip.  Works great while out of town, when deciding if a place will be good or not.
Version 5.6 2011-05-18 4
My very first review! An app is supposed to be a tool! This is the best tool for those that get around! Love it! Even if u are not travelling, just reading some nasty review of disgruntled hotel guests is a lot of fun! 

Trust me, download it now! And it's free
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Now that I have the ability to review places right on my iPhone, I use my tripadvisor much more. And I'm very satisfied.
Version 5.2 2011-07-06 5
I use this app more than I do their website!  I especially love being able to flip through traveler's photos faster.
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 5
I was going to Minneapolis for the first time, knew nothing about the city or what to do. Within 30 minutes I had an entire weekend planned.
Version 5.9 2011-10-31 5
Most comprehensive analysis of hotel and restaurant options. The maps are very helpful and are other dated reviews for recency.
Version 6.1 2012-06-09 5
Not sure where to go next or what to see next?  Type in your destination area and see hotels and activities in advance.
Version 8.2 2013-12-04 5
Use Tripadvisor whenever I want to find a nice restaurant where I'm staying. Haven't gotten a bum steer yet!   Easy to use too!
Version 5.6 2011-06-09 5
Always refer to Trip Advisor before going anywhere. I always check it for local places to see if we agree. We generally do.
Version 6.2 2012-07-18 5
I use this mainly to find activities and excursions at places we travel to and it is the best.  Also very good for hotels and restaurants.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 4
I like the App, but it needs a spell checker. I used it all the time while visiting San Francisco. The map interface is very helpful in getting around when you are in a big city.
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 5
Easy to use.  Especially helpful for travel information.  Love the local options.  Far more user friendly then the booking sites.
Version 5.7 2011-07-22 5
I have used this site online and via this app. It is very user friendly. I like the saves feature. I rely on this site for most of my travel reviews!
Version 6.0 2012-03-26 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 3
Great app, but every page should have a Share button allowing us to share what we're viewing... Via a copy URL, email, Facebook or Twitter post!  Who travels alone?  We want to share our ideas with those we want to go on the trip with us!  Get SOCIAL, TripAdvisor!
Version 6.1 2012-04-22 5
Using Tripadvisor helps you use your time and money effectively and efficiently. Works for me.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-21 5
This is a very useful way to find things gives you all the information you need plus reviews.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
omg this app has saved me from making wrong choices thanks to the reviews other traveler's write
Version 8.3 2013-12-24 5
I always check this app when I go to a new restaurant/hotel...  It's easy to use, easy to search, easy to make posts.  Check it out!
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 4
Just had to keep begging me to rate the app... That popup every five seconds is what dropped it a star, it's a good app though would also be nice to have links to the actual website of the hotels- b&bs.
Version 5.9 2011-12-26 5
Between TA and Expedia, I can do all of my research and ensure I can get to the best places, with the best service, and have the best time for a reasonable price!
Version 6.1 2012-07-08 5
I have been using tripadvisor to plan both domestic travel and some travel in Europe that we are planning for the fall. Great resource.
Version 6.6 2012-10-19 5
I love having this app to find great local eateries when traveling.  So far I have found I generally agree with the restaurant ratings it gives!
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 5
Love this app! Makes it easy to review hotels and feel confident before you book your vacation plans! Thanks :0)
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
Just a wonderful app that is easy to use and incredibly helpful. Thanks to those that make this such a thoughtful tool for travelers!
Version 5.7 2011-08-15 5
This app is very helpful as it seems the people contributing really care. Hopefully it will remain a reliable source.
Version 6.1 2012-04-11 5
I love how quickly I can find out about hotels, restaurants, and tourism when I visit new cities.
Version 6.6 2012-10-02 2
As previously stated, this app has become horrible with each new update.. The map freezes up, sometimes I click on the "things to do" button and it puts me in an entirely different city!  And why is it such a hassle to get to the travel forum!?  Please fix the map and provide a better navigation bar
Version 6.6 2013-03-19 5
This app has been invaluable for travel. I consult it on every trip and have never been surprised. The reviews are descriptive and accurate.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 5
Started using Tripadvisor on a trip to Vietnam, Cambodia and New Zealand. It helped us find the perfect motels and some great restaurants.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-04 5
Have used trip advisor many times always leads to a win with restaurant and lodging decisions!!
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 4
I use tripadvisor for every hotel and restaurant before I go. Sometimes inn keepers fiberwibber about their places, but look in the reviews and you will find the truth.
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 4
I used trip advisor to help review and choose hotels and activities on our recent European vacation. It was a very helpful tool. The app is a bit clunky, but the information was great.
Version 6.6 2012-12-09 5
Love the app more than the web version! Simple to use, great information and always helpful! Only travel app I use!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-27 5
I have found the content to be valuable and it's easy to locate what you need quickly
Version 8.3 2014-01-05 5
I love Trip Advisor. I use it when planning family vacations to find places to stay and things to do. It's my go to app for vacation planning!
Version 5.9 2012-01-03 5
Have been using Trip Advisor for years. Excellent resource! Even refer to it when traveling to areas we know well. Love the app!
Version 5.8 2012-07-22 5
One of the better ways to discover places to go, things to do, where to sleep when you're a traveller. Always at your fingertips.
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 4
I am often already the road when I need a restaurant or hotel recommendation and this iPhone app comes in handy.  I think TripAdvisor has the best information and I  prefer it to any other rating sites.
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 5
My wife and I use this app frequently when out of town. We generally tend to make our decisions on where to dine based on this app.
Version 5.7 2011-08-26 4
Really good app. But it should have some offline capabilities. It would be better to be able to save some parts of maps and the to do list created by user.
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5
I travel frecuently overseas and the information provided by Trip Advisor is complete, accurate and very useful. Congratulations.
Version 6.1 2012-05-01 5
TripAdvisor will be the most reliable reference. Hotels and restaurants should take the reviews and the ratings into consideration to improve
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 5
Very accurate reviews from people who seem to have the same travel needs and observations that I do.
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 5
Gives you everything you could want when exploring.
Version 5.9 2011-11-21 5
Great amount of information with easy access
Version 5.93 2012-03-02 4
seems like it is very helpful in planning our vacation. i picked out hotels, added them to a saved list and could look them up when i wanted to.  the maps are decent too.
Version 6.6 2012-09-28 4
When we are traveling, we are starting to use it to find interesting info. So far it has proved very helpful. As long as we have Internet or phone service. If not, then you are out of luck.
Version 6.6 2013-01-06 5
It's great to get other users perceptions, even better when they leave insider tips
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 5
I used trip advisor to plan excursions on our western Mediterranean cruise. Excellent choices and huge savings from cruise ship options!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-05 5
I like trip advisor. I learned that trip advisor can help on finding on almost every place we wanted to know.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
This app has helped to plan our trip to Italy and make everything easier by helping us to know we are picking respectable hotels and tours!
Version 5.8 2011-09-10 4
Application works in a straight-forward, intuitive way... Very predictable and very reliable.
Version 5.8 2011-10-05 5
I go to Trip Advisor to read the reviews of people who have actually been there before I go to any new place, business or personal.
Version 6.3 2012-07-20 3
The traveler ratings and reviews are helpful, but I find it terribly difficult to get general information, sort by activity, zoom into maps without changing the listings of restaurants, etc.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Thanks for providing a forum for ppl to read reviews for local places and for promoting favorite places!
Version 8.2 2013-12-18 5
Use it every time I plan a trip.  Best part is the reviews are accurate and you know what you're getting for what you're paying.
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 4
It may be trying too many things, and one never really knows how someplace is based on ratings. For me it's all about the food, while others harp on service or atmosphere. But, the app does what it says it does.
Version 5.92 2012-02-03 5
A Popular site makes it have lots of reviews for each place; it's nice to have plenty of experiences to read from.
Version 6.3 2012-07-14 5
Love,love, love it! It has everything you need to know, about every place you you want to know about! Detailed and clean to understand. Get it!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 5
Great information for places worldwide. 
One of the few accurate guides for lodging and dining in Mexico
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 5
Trip advisor provides some of the best advice and travel ratings on the web, and the app makes it easy to search and filter.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 4
This app is very close to the full version website that I prefer to use on my laptop. I use the the iPhone version when I am on the go and need some quick advice on a restaurant. Very fast and helpful.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
I use this app all the time when I am traveling or planning a trip. Extremely handy and makes it easy to make reservations as well. Love it.
Version 6.3 2012-07-18 5
No need for the website.  Smooth interface.
Version 6.2 2013-02-18 3
I LOVE trip advisor, people really collaborate to make it a very useful tool to attempt to remove those bad travel experiences. 

The app is not robust enough. Compare how easy it is to use the yelp app for similar info and you'll see where the TA app needs to go.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-09 5
I never realized that so many people do a lot of research of Hotels prior to booking. Hope all my reviews will help everyone out!!!
Version 8.3 2013-12-23 5
I've used this app for awhile now and rely on it for its honest user reviews. The app is well conceived and I love the save option.

Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
You really get a lot from this app. Amazing!  Easy to use and helps you find good places and things to do. I highly recommend it.
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 3
If you are looking for honest reviews this might not be your app. I am in the process of booking a stay in Bora Bora and most of the reviews talking about booking with Pacific for less. Now I could understand one or two but the more reviews I read the more I see this travel agency come up.
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
It makes me feel like I can travel much more simpler and I'll have time to kick back and touch soft things in life.
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5
Great app. I use it all the time from checking flights, motels, and eating places. Very helpful with the reviews and maps.
Version 5.9 2011-11-27 5
Easy to use. Really helpful reviews. Easy to navigate. I have never been surprised when I visit any of the locations I researched.
Version 6.1 2012-09-09 5
We use this site for every trip we plan, read all the reviews and we post many to help future vacationers.
Version 5.6 2011-05-17 5
It has so many options for so many cities, including international travels. I travel frequently and this is a great app to help plan!
Version 5.6 2011-05-18 5
I love my trip advisor app. I have always liked trip advisor online and now it is even easier just to get on my itouch and check out reviews.
Version 6.1 2012-05-04 5
I highly recommend this app, it's very helpful when you are traveling and looking for info on where to stat, eat etc.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 4
Has everything to be rated and you get brownie points for showing appreciation :) something someone deserves after showing hard work and passion
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-13 5
Very useful tool for making hotel selection especially when traveling overseas
Version 5.5 2011-05-05 5
We are planning a couple of trips this year, so I have really enjoyed reading the reviews and looking at photos.  Very glad I found this app!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-14 5
I love having the tripadvisor app!!! Its sooo convenient. I can read the reviews and see pics right on my phone so i always know what to expect! Thanks tripadvisor!! =)
Version 5.9 2011-12-21 5
This is an app that all serious travelers should have on their iPad. It is intuitive, graphically attractive and best of all, free. Highly recommended.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
Excellent app - easy to use!  Love I can look up places to stay and eat and best things to do without surfing the web.
Version 6.4 2012-09-09 5
Easy to use. Rate and provide feedback from mobile or iPad. Reviews are accurate and informative.
Version 6.6 2013-05-09 5
This is the only app I use when planning a vaca. Has everything the full site has except easier to use on the iPad/phone.
Version 5.4 2011-04-14 5
A wonderful app!  It came just in time for my trip to europe!   I can't wait to use it!  Thank you Trip Advisor!  Now I will not have to carry around so many guide books!
Version 5.1 2011-08-14 5
Intuitive, easy to use. Easy to get multiple results in several categories centered around the chosen location.
Version 5.7 2011-09-22 3
A reasonably good app that provides some good recommendations and some tourist traps; however, no more so that other travel sites.  useful for a general idea of where to stay and eat but get some second opinions/ do some additional searching on your own.
Version 5.91 2012-01-15 5
This is a great tool and has helped us already many times to make travel arrangements. It's always best to hear comments from people directly.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 2
Three things to fix before this app is worth the trouble of using it:
1. Search engine doesn't find even some of the most popular venues.
2. Map constantly moves if you look at an item within it, necessitating relocating the previous view.
3. Pictures in pictures tab don't load.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 5
Best of the travel apps, in my opinion. Quick, responsive, and it hasn't locked upon me as others have reported.
Version 5.6 2011-06-01 5
This application was very helpful when I was booking my vacation and offered a variety of pictures.
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 4

Version 6.2 2012-07-26 5
I love this app! Especially the photos people share. That way you can really see what a place looks like and not just "staged" photos!
Version 6.1 2012-04-24 3
Would be nice to review my past posts and manage account more still have to log in trip advisor on the web to do so.  Kind of redundant if I just have to go to the web site anyhow.  Haven't decided if I will keep it, it is ok for quick look ups.
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 5
This is a wonderful app for planning your next trip.  It allows you to save ideas for things to do, places to stay or eat.  Easy to use.
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 5
This app really helps when you are going to a new city! Tips from other people who have already visited are so helpful! I can't wait to use it again!
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 4
There are a few nit picky things from a navigation stand point.  But I planned and executed an entire vacation only going to places that were highly recommended and had a very good trip.
Version 6.0 2012-03-20 2
This new version won't allow me to copy and paste notes into my notes app. I had many notes for an upcoming Italy trip and now I can not do this. I wish this app would allow you to save notes into a trip file like the computer allows. Plus I have to select country and city EACH time, why can't it remember or save it?
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
Love using trip advisor and writing reviews.  Provides us with a lot of fun on our trips and we savor things more because we are more observant for writing a review.  Fun!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-23 5
Everywhere we go around America, TripAdvisor helps us select the quality establishments!
Version 5.9 2011-12-17 5
I love this app cause it allowed me to see how NASTY!!!!! Or how Beautiful  Some of these hotels are. You get to see real people's pictures of the hotel and not just what the hotel wants u to see!!!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 5
This is the best app if you travel or stay at home. Let you rate the establishments so everyone else can benefit from your comments.
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 5
The hotel was great! The location excellent!! We were upgraded to a suite!! the break fast was spectacular!! We highly recommend.
We thank all the staff!! Specially to ANA,IRENE and MAJDI!!!
Version 5.9 2012-01-07 5
This is the "Go to app",  weather your in your home town or out on the road. Truly one of the most complete & helpful apps that I use.  A must for travelers . Highly recommend.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
Having Trip advisor has given me much more confidence to travel inexpensively in the developing world.
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 4
I always refer to TripAdvisor and this is a decent app. The only con is I wish you could search by name though. 

And what's with their asking me to write a review 10 seconds after I first opened it for the 1st time?
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
The number of reviews allows you to really gather information to make the right vacation decisions.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 5
I really like using this app to plan trips. It gives great ideas and it is so helpful to read other people's reviews.
Version 5.8 2011-09-27 5
One word, Fantastic!! Small, yet comfortable with 4 great rooms and a delicious breakfast. Can't wait to go back and explore more of Amish country.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
This has quickly become my favorite travel app. Headed to Paris in the spring and I love all the reviews and suggestions that are provided.
Version 6.6 2013-03-09 5
Great advise from real people...If you need help planning a trip this apps is for you. Great ideas of places to visit and reviews.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-30 5
The fact that you get all the info you need for your trip is the most important thing when traveling
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5
Great app! Easy to use and is fully functional unlike most free apps. Makes using Trip Advisor easy no matter where you are.
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
An easy way to make the most of a trip. The only thing I'd like to see is an option to search for dog friendly restaurants and venues.
Version 6.0 2012-03-24 5
We have used this app on our last 2 vacations. Love reading recent reviews.  Plan to keep using it to plan vacations with the family.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
Love this. I can check out places, things to do and know ahead of time about places. Thanks bunches.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-14 5

Version 7.1.1 2013-09-24 5
I love using trip advisor to have insight before choosing a hotel and restaurant while on the road.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
Great resource for overseas trips. Nice to be able to see recent reviews for local places right when you need to decide where to eat. Better than a concierge.
Version 6.2 2012-07-14 2
Some of these ratings are BS. Depending on age, demographic, or whatever, opinions will vary. I think users should be rated by other users, either positively or negatively, for rep points to validate their ratings. Some people just don't get out often and think EVERYTHING is awesome, or they  expect too much. Take these ratings with a grain of salt.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
I used trip advisor to plan my wedding in Jamaica. I don't know what I would have done without it!
Version 6.6 2012-10-11 5
Trip Advisor helps you organize your trip and decide what's best for your needs. A must
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-23 5
Helpful to have it with you for reviews with location services
Version 5.9 2011-11-11 5
Fantastic site. Really helps find items quickly and mostly up to date on information
Version 5.93 2012-02-26 5
This is a great app.  Gives all information that could be needed on any trip.  Reviews and photos included help to make the right decision.
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 4
...I could access my account.  Otherwise, a very good app! Also, on a few occasions I have noticed that hotels and restaurants are incorrectly marked on the map.  Much easier to use on the iPad.
Version 6.3 2012-07-21 5
As I went on a road trip from Dallas to San Marcos, I found that this app was really useful when trying to find things to do and places to eat.
Version 6.3 2012-08-11 5
I never book a hotel without consulting TA. The app is just as user friendly as the web site
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
one of the best apps out to help you choose your vacation package, flights, rentals, or hotels!!!!! With helpful reviews!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-22 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-29 4
Great app other than the fact you are limited in options on the iphone and the search area is not as broad as it is on ipad. Still very useful and we love having it at our fingertips.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-17 5
I use trip advisor all the time. It haven't failed me yet and I post regularly. Thank you for having this app for us to use!
Version 5.5 2011-07-18 5
I rarely travel without extensively checking Tripadvisor online.  Now I can take it on the road...great app, easy to use.
Version 5.9 2011-12-21 5
Offers all functions of full website on app, which is good when traveling.
Version 6.3 2012-07-19 5
I always use Tripadvisor when travelling to look up the best restaurants. It hasnt steered me wrong yet!
Version 6.6 2013-02-05 5
It is a great resource for searching and getting personnal feelings from visitors like us. We always use for our travel plans.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-16 4
Trying to plan my trip to LA and whenever I try and click on the "multiple flights" choice, nothing loads. Love this app though
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-20 4
I use a lot while traveling of course.  The places we went to based on reviews did not disappoint!  Sometimes it is hard to search for a specific place but overall pleased with app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-14 5
This is a great app for travelers! We travel every year, and this app often gives us an outline of our trips! Reviews from others are super helpful!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-12 5
Has new features added from the last time i had it. Perhaps an year back. Totally a must have app. if you love traveling !
Version 5.7 2011-08-01 3
Nice to have quick access to reviews. However, I miss not seeing my earlier trips that I've saved and the map takes up too much real estate. Could be my newness to the app so I'll change my rating if I learn differently.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 3
You know all those filters on your full blown website? When can I use those in the app? Looks like I have price and neighborhood to use as filters for now. Otherwise this app is good. Your site is still the best! Update soon?
Version 5.8 2011-10-10 5
I am totally paranoid about bedbugs, and this is a very handy app to scour through reviews and find a nice clean hotel that doesn't cost a fortune!
Version 6.1 2012-05-31 5
Trip Advisor works hard to show people quality hotels, restaurants, flights, and rentals and it shows through this app.
Version 6.6 2013-04-04 5
We loved the Bel Air.  It was quiet, convenient, and a good value.  We enjoyed the service and the super clean facilities.  All the employees were very attentive and polite.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
Trip Advisor works great and takes u to exactly where you want. No links to everything else that YOU ARE NOT LOOKING for. Works very well and is fast.
Version 6.6 2012-12-06 5
What a wonderful app to have, helped me with my vacation in late 2012. A must have when you are out of your comfort zone.
Version 6.6 2013-01-27 5
Planning a trip to a place I've never been before. Very helpful in weeding the tourist traps from the real sites. Thanks
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
What a great app.  Much more than a way to make reservations.  Reviews, ideas, I use this a lot even in my own town for ideas.
Version 5.92 2012-02-20 4
Very simple to use. Large international database. For me, best used during travels for last minute decisions on what to do, where to eat etc. Lacks off the beaten path aspect but a great reference none the less.
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 2
Used this a lot in the past, until I noticed that even with hotels collecting bad reviews would still show adequate 'positive' ratings.. How to explain then that 3 reviews (one 5 stars, one 2 stars, and one star) averages to a 4 star establishment?? 

This is not right. Do correct this nonsense by stopping to think that real consumers are stupid.
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
Used app on road trip in California, extremely helpful, especially the restaurant suggestions.
Version 6.5 2012-09-24 5
Just few clicks away from my next getaway even easier to get to people's reviews
Version 8.2 2013-12-05 5
I love using this app when I'm traveling. Especially when they're deals combined. Keep up the good work.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
Been using this on our monster road trip through 10 states. Has all the great pertinent info needed!
Version 6.6 2013-02-03 5
Great app! Helps with picking the right hotel, finding the right restaurant, so far the app has not failed me.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-16 5
Makes travel 100% better! I can see the reviews on hotels, restaurants, and attractions before going.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 5
Simple and easy to use. You can save places/hotels ect that want to remember, so you don't have to make a separate list.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 4
I use the app mostly for researching hotel options and things to do in different towns around the world. Works well for this. The reviews are very valuable.
Version 5.8 2011-10-02 5
The app is extremely helpful. Need to use some discretion when using the reviews.
Version 5.92 2012-02-04 5
Fresh app. I like the street view tab. It allows you to search n view the area like your there through Iphone. Good deal.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
I always use trip advisor before traveling. This app makes it that much easier and I can actually use it while traveling
Version 5.7 2011-08-06 4
It shows me my current location and the restaurant / attraction that I want to go to on the map...  But then no option to get directions. Other than that this app is awesome for planning a vacation or spur of the moment something to do.
Version 5.92 2012-01-27 5
Use it for everything, but especially "near me now"
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
Has everything I need and is among the most responsive travel apps I use regularly.
Version 6.2 2012-06-13 2
So far it is really unfunctional. The map on "save" is unusable and doesn't seem to function with regular iPad touch commands. You have to use a zoom button..  I was unable to recenter the map so what use is that.  I will just keep using the web page on my mobile browser.. This app is a real disappointment.
Version 6.6 2012-10-02 4
Would be nice to send feedback to tripadvisor on inaccurate information like restaurants that are closed and hotels that have been re-named photos that aren't accurate.
Version 6.6 2013-04-23 5
Gives the traveler good insight.  Always chk the hotel or restaurant website for latest info.  I've used TA for years.  iPad app is super.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
This app has been very useful to me while dating online. Very helpful for trying out new places to eat.
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
I've been using it for years. Highly rated restaurants are always good! Use it and be part of a great and helpful community!
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 5
Hotel ratings are right on. Eating establishments are numerous and seem to be updated frequently so as to be relevant.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Used for the first time while vacationing in Williamsburg, VA. Never led us astray. Used for everything from restaurants to entertainment. Loved it!
Version 5.93 2012-02-26 5
I always refer to trip advisor before a vacation. The app does not disappoint. I was able to find exactly what I needed quickly with no hassle.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 4
You can't read messages from the app, so you have to go into the Safari site.  I also hate that the app asks you to sign in via Facebook each time you open the app.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Lots of good information from fellow travelers.  Great ideas for places to visit that aren't always on the beaten path.  Hasn't steered me wrong yet.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-23 5
Has saved me many times!  Appreciate all its features--handy access to the map once you have the place!
Version 5.6 2011-06-06 4
Very informational. Easy to use, easy to access. Problems when trying to scroll through pictures. In order to scroll down you have to slide your finger in a perfect straight line
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 5
Every time I travel and feel lost, I get useful advises from here. It's like a GPS for finding great restaurants or hotels.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 3
Limits to only hotel search, vice bed and breakfast or vacation rentals which the website can do. A little watered down but useful on the go for quick hotel or attraction reviews. Please upgrade this app to a fully functional tripadvisor.
Version 6.6 2012-12-13 5
Must have app for travel! When people take the time to write reviews (good or bad) its noteworthy and can help make better travel plans
Version 6.6 2013-03-13 5
The most helpful APP for me. Use it all over the country and always find the best places to eat and stay.
Version 8.2 2013-12-07 5
We use the trip advisor app during all our vacations and trips. It's helps us narrow down our options ..
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 5
Great user interface. Nice to have the ability to filter search results. Multiple map options. A+++
Version 5.8 2011-09-13 4
Got my iPad in time for a trip to Berlin and loaded this app right away. It has helped me get around, choose places to visit, find restaurants including where NOT to eat, and is easy and fun to use.
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 4
I have Tripadvisor on all my Internet devices.  We have used it frequently for our overseas planning and information.  Try it. You will be pleasantly surprised.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 5
There is not to much to say the app and the service are great. The best travel companion and event in town it provides you with tons of options.
Version 5.0.1 2011-08-07 5
I love & trust TripAdvisor for my travel needs. It's great to have the essential features of the website with me when I most need them. Well done!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 5
Perfect travel google you. You ask and it has all details with best.

Super travel assistance !
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-24 5
It's a great app for travelers. Any one can easily find out the actual destiny through this app. It's very helpfull.
Version 6.0 2012-03-24 5
With this app you can write and read reviews on the go. So on the road when u have to choose just do a quick check and go
Version 5.6 2011-06-22 5
Tripadvisor's app is very easy to use and can be used at anytime, it's a must for people who are looking for a good bite to eat or a nice hotel.
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 5
We're new in SD and having using this app for everything. All places we've gone have been excellent! Really satisfied!
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 4
I didn't think that this app would be half as good as it was, but it proved me wrong. It even allows you to book stuff like tours. I will be using this app a lot more when I travel.
Version 6.1 2012-06-14 5
This app is great for any travel. Has lots of useful all around information and a must for helping with travel plans.
Version 6.6 2013-01-04 5
Filter functionality needs improvement, more options.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
Even though our kids are grown, still enjoy going to the orchard.  People are just enjoying it and the dounuts rock
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
I am often checking numerous hotel pages and this is quick, precise and accurate.  Great app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-04 4
If I could see my profile using the mobile app it would be great. Love the app though and being able to let others know about our experiences.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-02 5
-timely while traveling
-saves money and time
-sincere reviews from veteran travelers
-easy to use
-I've used it in Rome, Paris, and Pismo Beach!
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 1
I hate it when apps are improved so that they are less functional than before. In the old version, you could move the map and search again for hotels in the displayed map. No can do in this version as hotels with dozens of reviews will not display on the map or show up even in the details. I'm using iPad 1, and latest IOS. I will have to go back to the web from now on. Bummer.
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
Much better, people here write thoughtful responses, and it isn't subject to fudging like Yelp is
Version 5.1 2010-11-04 4
Was doing some on-the-fly research during our recent Tuscany holiday and found this app very handy.  But it desperately needs the ability to bookmark places you've researched.
Version 5.9 2012-01-10 5
This app has saved me heartache
 and disappointment from many different restaurants and hotels.
Version 6.1 2012-04-16 5
I love trip advisor, and this app jus makes it that much better.  I will be going on vacation in a couple of days, and plan to use it in Ft. Lauderdale.
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 5
Been using it for years. Love it for finding new place while traveling or when in a new place to live.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-16 5
I love the trip advisor  ! You must have it ! Great to read the reviews before you go to a hotel or restaurant ! Very accurate information !
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 4
This application basically immitates the website in the sense of it being helpful, interesting and very informative.
I love TripAdvisor, it made purchasing flight tickets to Europe very simple.
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5
Use this guide over any other travel guide.   This is the future: user-based reviews for everything!
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 4
Interface is much simpler than browser. With saved settings making a reservation is quick and easy.
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 4
I like it, simple and easy to use, but it gives only the expensive hotel and lodges, which is fine but having the hotels for the less paying customers would be nice... Hence the 4 stars..
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
I used this app during my recent visit to Austin....it is on the dot about getting my expectations right at each location it mentioned
Version 1.0 2008-07-11 1
Phone #'s should click to call, of course - don't.  
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
I actually use this one instead of ignore it on my "travel" window.  It's
Helpful to find reviews on places I'm interested in.
Version 5.92 2012-02-20 5
I don't know why this isn't the go to service in my circle. I really learned about it while in Europe but its equally as great here in NYC. Trustworthy users and great app.
Version 5.92 2012-03-03 5
Always get tips and recommendations before traveling.  Has never let me down! :)
Version 6.0 2012-03-25 5
I use Tripadvisor when I travel, and also for some news ideas close to home. This app is essential for Tripadvisor enthusiasts!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-10 5
Excellent site to make sure you're choosing the right vacation for you! Love the photo uploads from users.
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 5
Use it all of the time and for every trip.  Don't stay anywhere any more without checking the reviews first.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
I love reading the reviews and seeing the pics taken by real travelers. There are no attempts to make a small room look deceptively large :)
Version 6.2 2012-07-16 5
I know I can count on TripAdvisor because real people write the reviews.  It is very handy on the go.
Version 6.4 2012-09-27 5
We count on trip advisor and have never been led astray. Primarily use for restaurants when on the road. Get this app!
Version 6.6 2012-12-24 5
This is a great app, I met a girl and went on a date I'm the next town where she lives and used the app to find the best places to eat and to grab some coffee after.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 5
Easy to use app; very resourceful.  Amazingly accept bad reviews of places which is especially helpful.
Version 5.7 2011-06-27 4
I like the app but I am trying to plan a trip to the Amish country in Ohio and it doesn't show many things to do. Since I have been there a few times and know there are lots more to do. Just they would show more.
Version 5.92 2012-03-17 4
I have come to rely on Trip Advisor for both restaurants and hotels.  Haven't been steered wrong yet!  The only issue I've had is that their price ranges are sometimes a little lower than our actual experience.
Version 6.0 2012-03-24 5
This app really works, love the map aspects and geo referencing for proximity hits on restaurants and attractions.  As always, take ratings and comments with a grain of salt.
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 5
I've really enjoyed this app. It has been so useful during our recent vacation. I used it to find hotels, restaurants and movie theaters. Love it!
Version 6.5 2012-09-24 5
Like the accessibility from my phone and Nook. Great to find quick restaurants and things to do.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-19 5
I love using my app for dinner ideas and location.  Also finding what things are going on at my location.
Version 8.5 2014-03-03 4
While I realize that a mobile ap can't have all the features of a website, it would be nice to have separate ratings for service.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-29 2
If your looking to get a quick overview of an area, this app will do. However it lacks a lot of features to make it useful. An advanced search would help you specify certain criteria you want in a hotel. The landscape mode shows the scrollbar in the middle of the screen which indicates this app wasn't tested very well.
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 3
I love the site and enjoy the app when it works, but I just got back from Belize and Guatemala where it WA useless even on wifi. Adding insult to injury, whenever I went to the site though Safari it kept trying to redirect me to the app store.
Version 5.7 2011-07-08 5
Easy to use. 
I find the travel information very accurate. 
Keep up the good work everyone - it is only as good as it's users.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
App works great and the reviews are very helpful when choosing restaurants and hotels when traveling.
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
I use this app not only for finding the best when traveling but also for finding local faces that I didn't know was there.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
When ever I am traveling to a different country, I alway check with Trip Advisor. It provides real people comments.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-11 2
The new version places prices from providers right over part of the photos. As if there isn't room for those ads somewhere else. C'mon, this is about the viewers.... I give Tripadvisor a 2 star for greed for this. As for performance, the app crashes when viewing photos after only showing 5 or 6.
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5
I have spent countless hours of planning dream vacations... Not that I can afford to go on them, but it's always fun to dream.  Thanks TripAdvisor!
Version 5.8 2011-08-27 5
I was very irritated when I had to continuously type in deferent hotel names to find reviews this app eliminates that problem
Version 5.92 2012-01-23 5
We travel frequently and always start our research on Trip Advisor. The hotel commentary and ratings are extremely helpful.
Version 5.8 2011-09-02 5
Much more complete than other similar apps. Ratings and reviews of restaurants and hotels are very helpful.
Version 5.9 2011-11-21 5
Tons of info right at your fingertips without having to be near a computer. All the info of the online site in the palm of your hand.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 5
This has been the best apps ever...easy to use, direct and precise, keeps you informed with the best or worst deals...gives you badges and it's fun!
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 5
I use Trip Advisor on both my desktop and phone. Believe me, you don't want to book a room without looking at this first!
Version 6.6 2012-12-29 4
Gives an good idea where to go to. But sometimes I just don't know what that place is and have to check on the internet. I would appreciate if a category or one sentence description was added.
Version 6.6 2012-12-31 5
It's nice having this application. Especially when you travel by car. Very helpfull!!
Version 6.6 2013-04-06 5
Faster and easier to use, too, I think, than their website.
Version 8.4 2014-02-01 5
Easy to navigate.  Writing reviews or checking out hotels has never been easier!!!
Version 5.5 2011-05-05 5
I *love* this app and use it all the time when we're traveling. Its especially useful for finding really good, non-chain restaurants.
Version 6.2 2012-06-29 5
Great way to find information & suggestions. So glad I downloaded this app to use! I highly recommend it.
Version 8.3 2014-01-05 5
Love this app. Always use this to research places to stay. Will not embark on a trip without checking this out first.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 5
The new feature make it more convenient to find what you really are looking for while on the road.
Version 5.8 2011-08-30 4
This was a very useful app for our recent family vacation to Oregon. Used it to find places to stay and eat. Still getting used to the different look and feel from the website.
Version 6.2 2012-06-16 5
In an unfamiliar place, just clicked on restaurants and looked for highly recommended ones.  Got a great meal!
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 5
I would not plan any trip without first consulting Trip Advisor!  Great information, real reviews written by real people!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-25 5
I am sure even Aliens would use this app when traveling on earth. If you wan to enjoy your trip, use this App, Period.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-22 5
I find tripadvisor very helpful when trying to find restaurants in particular.
Version 8.5 2014-03-28 5
Probable the most valuable app I have. The only one we use when traveling. Reviews are spot on and currant. Great job!!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
I like having all the reviews in one place for a destination.  It is so easy and fast.  Perfect for that quick recommend.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
Most helpful travel accessory besides a map!  Great information to help plan an enjoyable vacation.
Version 5.8 2011-10-14 5
This type of app really highlights some of the great uses of having a iPad especially when traveling.
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
Amazing site!!! Everything I could have wanted.  Shows way more pictures on this app than on the actual site
Version 6.6 2013-04-20 5
I use tripadvisor for every vacation. The reviews are from everyday people w/o bias opinions. Trust it completely.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 4
Like most functions but could improve rating system and include option for directions when using map.
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
Very useful app whether you're traveling or just looking for someplace to go near home.  Clean, easy to use, fast.  Love it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
Trip advisor is great but the reason people look at it is for the reviews. 
They shrink the review to the corner and have the location take up most of the screen. 
Hopefully this will be fixed
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
Great source to use when researching hotels, locations, things to do and read honest depictions from fellow travelers.
Version 5.8 2011-09-16 5
Don't remember how I traveled without it.  Great for trip planning and equally useful to find a great place to eat when I haven't planned ahead of time.
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 5
I love the trip advisor app. It is so handy when looking for restaurants in the same area of the hotels,and also the attractions that are close by.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 5
Love this app....always check it before and during travel. I always find great places that I'd never know about otherwise!
Version 6.3 2012-07-16 5
Trip advisor is an awesome tool for finding cool things to do when you travel. Wouldn't travel without it.
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 5
Just downloaded it a few days ago it's really cool, to find new places to eat and to have people's comments on them places.
Version 5.8 2011-09-07 5
This app made it so easy to easily and quickly submit a review. It's excellent for learning what's near by!
Version 5.92 2012-01-31 5
If I want to find out things about a restaurant or hotel I just type it in here. Also it helps you compare prices with other sites
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 4
This app let's you do everything same as the website, except edit your profile, which I wish you could do.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-15 5
I used it for days in Nashville. Worked great, lots of info, similar to full site, great write ups, links and pictures
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-13 5
Very useful to use when traveling or even just checking out places at home
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 3
This app is great at what it currently does, but I, along with everyone else I'm sure, desperately want the ability to edit account settings, view badges, etc. In summary, we want the app to do everything the website does.
Version 5.5 2011-06-25 5
Read restaurant reviews from the comfort of our own pool on our honeymoon! Great functionality - feels very similar to the full site. Love!
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
Allows you to plan ahead before getting to destination by providing great advice on places to see, place to eat and stay. Love this app.
Version 5.8 2011-09-07 2
This works like the full app. A major disappointment is that you can't save recommended places. I'd like to keep a list of restaurants for instance and then see which I encounter and I may not want to use phone minutes when traveling and may be somewhere with no wifi
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 5
I use this app to get other people's opinions on motels we might stay in, and it's very helpful and easy to use.
Version 5.92 2012-01-18 5
I can't plan or think of a vacation destination and not use tripadvisor to check hotel reviews. It's enlightening and money saving.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-18 4
Not a bad app, the only downside I see is when your logged into the app you can't see your account, it just acknowledges who you are and that you have a tripadvisor account
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-26 5
My go to app when I am traveling to figure out where to go eat, stay, shop and site see.
Version 8.3 2014-01-28 5

Version 8.5 2014-03-22 5
This has become my go to app when I travel. Reviews are very reliable and I haven't been steered wrong yet.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
I was able to plan our impromptu trip easily from my phone. I love the convenience of having this reputable site on my iPhone!
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5
I always check this out before booking any hotel
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 3
I can't seem to get the whole page to show the map- I hate the menu to the left of map, plus where is the overview of the location? Some things are better ( the localized restaurant reviews) and some are not from the full web version.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-24 5
This is a great application with accurate information and advise. It helped us during our west of the island vacation.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-29 5
I use their website all the time and find it very useful in planning my trips. Their section on restaurants with reviews is excellent.
Version 6.4 2012-09-22 5
Always plan our trips using trip advisor.  From hotels to things to do.  We have planned 4 trips with tis app and we love it!
Version 8.2 2013-11-30 4
A good app that is useful when visiting locations on vacation, business or even in town. Use it frequently to find local restaurants and tourist traps.
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 5
Great app! Tripadvisor has always been a trusted website and this app makes it even easier to get the info you're looking for!
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 5
Makes their website easily accessible for the iPad. I use this regularly to find great places and to write reviews.
Version 6.6 2013-01-13 5
The app is not as good as the online interface, but it is still great.  Trip Advisor has the best reviews of all the hotel and restaurant sites.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-13 4
I find myself using this app more and more. My only wish is for more detail from those who rate restaurants with five stars. Don't tell us that this is the best Italian in the area - tell us exactly why
Version 5.8 2011-08-14 5
We use this app for even the city we have lived in for 12 years. It helps give new ideas and things to do. Easy to use.
Version 5.8 2011-08-22 5
This app has been extremely useful and helpful while traveling to new places. I highly recommend it!
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 5

Version 6.2 2012-07-12 5
Extremely helpful when searching for flights and lodging.
Version 6.6 2013-04-14 5
I have never wanted to travel more than now because of the app! Any destination seems possible.

I really like it it gives you all the information you need at least to start thinking about your trip.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5

I use this app for up to date reviews on hotels and restaurants. Found a great out-of-the-way restaurant in Paris with it! Highly recommend.
Version 5.93 2012-03-06 5
Have used it for years. My most  useful app for picking hotels, restaurants & attractions anywhere. We used it extensively in Turkey & Greece this past summer.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 4
Works well & quite helpful mobile version but prefer web version better. Web version seems easier to use.
Version 6.4 2012-08-20 3
I like this app, it works fine.  I detest the fact that every time I open it I am prompted to login to Facebook.  It's annoying there should be a way to disable it.  I have a trip advisor login and that should be enough.
Version 6.6 2013-02-03 5
They have everything you can want so find something new to do
Version 6.6 2013-04-04 5
I'm a big Yelper.  I didn't realize that trip advisor was anything but hotels and flights.  I love this app! It has everything I need :)
Version 5.8 2011-10-09 5
Whenever I travel now (a lot!) I always check out TripAdvisor first. Hasn't steered me wrong yet!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
I enjoy reading reviews along with submitting new ones.  It is a must for traveling to new places.
Version 6.6 2013-02-06 5
Was in dire need of alternative accommodations in Chiang Mai recently and this was a great help for reviewing options.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-15 4
Consistently use trip advisor for all of my trips everywhere I go.  Wouldn't go without the app or the city guides.  Taking a star away because it keeps asking me to rate the app!   Annoying!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-21 5
Love my Trip Advisor app when I'm on the go and looking for good lodgings or a great meal.  Easy to use and lots of helpful info!
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 5
This app is even better than the website. It is straight forward

Version 5.93 2012-03-06 4
I love being able to look up things on my iPhone or iPad without having to fire up the computer! This app has simplified my planning/travel needs. Definitely worth it!
Version 6.6 2012-11-03 5
I love this app!  It has helped me find great restaurants and lodging as well as whittle down the list of things to do on my trip to Peru.
Version 6.6 2013-02-16 5
Nicely put together bogland that it has tourist attraction not just food and hotels. Love using this app.
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
A lot of good info and tons of pics... Wish there was a way to check for package deals, but, no reason to give it less then 5 stars
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-17 4
I find this app pretty useful especially when I was on vacation. However, there are a lot of places missing an the option to add places doesn't work.
Version 5.6 2011-06-08 5
I've been traveling around SE Asia and this app has been one of the most useful resources for me to make the most of my little time here.
Version 5.9 2011-11-04 5
I relied on this app to plan a recent trip to Vancouver and couldn't be happier. We saw the best of the city in just a short weekend.
Version 6.0 2012-03-29 4
When in a new location, this app (like it's "big brother" website) gives me the input I want when I don't have time to be gastronomically adventurous!  Recommended!
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
Does exactly what I want ...
Zoom in on a map, find all nearby hotels, scan the reviews, and go to a booking website.
Perfect!!!
Version 6.6 2013-02-02 5
Love taking trips with the family and this app helps full those "what are we doing today?" questions.

If you are familiar with the website, this is a great implementation of it. Very useful while traveling.

I think it's great to be able to write reviews on everything as a real person and not just a critic. The app is so easy to use as well! Love it!

Works when I want it to without glitches and brings up the most current flights.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-10 4
. . . such as my wife and myself, TripAdvisor has proven to be invaluable in identifying which restaurants we wish to patronize and which we want to avoid.
Version 7.0 2013-05-05 5
Using constantly on cross-country drive; TA was also super helpful in Vietnam, wish I'd had my iPhone and the app there!

I have had no problems with this app. I use it all the time to look up different hotels. I really like this app

My go to app for travel reviews while on the road! I constantly use this app in conjunction with other online bookings. My only complaint is that photo scrolling for hotel listings is not smooth.

It's nice to be able to preview a restaurant, hotel or attraction before you get there - no one wants to waste their money - and this app is perfect for doing that on-the-go!
Version 5.8 2011-10-25 5
I wouldn't think of staying at any hotel until I consult TripAdvisor.  The app has made it easier than ever!  Love, love, love the iPad version!

This app (and TripAdvisor) give me thorough, accurate advice on places to stay, dine, and visit.  Plus, this app is soooo easy to use. Try it; you'll like it!

Always use this site before booking anything. Actual photos from people and their reviews.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 5
This site seems to be a  bit more accurate then Yelp. People stick to the subject on Trip Advisor. Reviews are informative, and well worded.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
We love the website and the app is just as good. Great filtering capabilities and the rankings are very useful. Well worth the $0.00 :)
Version 6.5 2012-09-18 1
While none of our group has professional training,the four us with six or seven camera devices have pictures that equal some of the pros work I have seen.( must admit to only a few) We would like to share but message always comes up to download tripadvisor app. This was done back in June 2013.

The app is well designed and easy to use. The content for the travel locations was right on.

We use this app all the time! It's especially helpful for finding out what hidden little gems there are to explore wherever you happen to be. Love it!

This is a fantastic app to have on holiday!  It is extremely easy to use and covers everything I have seen in brochures and magazines.
Version 5.92 2012-02-03 4
This app is very useful for regular Trip Advisor users. It doesn't have all the functionality of the website, but almost! It certainly has an easy interface and good, clear architecture.
Version 6.0 2012-03-29 5
No site is better for a night away or trip to another country. Wouldn't travel without checking Trip Advisor!

The app is extremely reliable when choosing places to eat or hotels to stay at!  If you travel or eat out much this is a must have.
Version 6.3 2012-08-01 4
This app hasn't steered us wrong yet, but it misses a lot of lodging and dining choices. Still, we have found it to be a useful info source when traveling in unfamiliar places.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Great app for travel, checking out reviews for hotels, great recommendations for places to eat, and things to do. A must have & use!!

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-13 4
Love this app, but if you're looking for a pet friendly hotel, don't just rely on what it says. Has a Hilton Garden Inn in Tulsa listed as pet friendly. I called them to make sure, they don't allow any pets.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 4
This is a very good app for travelers. I am a Top Reviewer with them so I use it a bunch!  I wish there was an easy way to review posted rating I have done in the past. Highly recommended app!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 4
It's a little cumbersome, but better than using their full site on Safari.  When uploading pics during a view, the app quit twice.  A glitch that needs attention.  Overall, useful.
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 4
This is a very good iPad app. It works every bit as well as the Trip Advisor website.  I have not figured out how to sort by distance, but am pleased at how everything else works.
Version 5.9 2011-12-02 5
I'm in love with this app. Couldn't travel without playing around with it. You won't be disappointed.
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
Love Trip Advisor and have used it on my desktop to research many trips. This iPhone app is just as good and easy to navigate.
Version 6.6 2012-12-09 4
This is a great app and very helpful for getting opinions on stuff in a new place or whilst traveling.  Map view stops and starts, needs work.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-25 5
Their data base of hotels and things to do are growing every day, lots of great information and tips for planning a vacation.
Version 8.2 2013-11-28 5
It's great for searching for good establishments and is easy way to write a quick review of any establishment.
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
Great app. A must have if you take your iPad on trips.  The maps show you where you and where you want to go.
Version 8.1 2013-11-08 4
The app makes me manage my trip right on my phone. Totally handy. But the performance is no smooth at all. The app needs to be fixed random crashes and glitchy performance.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
Really intuitive app. Easier to navigate than the regular online version IMO. Looking forward to using on my next trip.
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 4
I don't travel anywhere without checking reviews from tripadvisor. I count on it and have not been disappointed with my decisions based on the reviews I've researched.
Version 8.5 2014-02-26 2
Site NEVER seems to update. There are several businesses in my town that have been closed for years but still rated. There are several businesses listed in categories they shouldn't be. I.e restaurants that aren't restaurants at all. This hurts the ratings of those that are. I have reported this to tripadvisor on several occasions to no avail. HORRIBLE.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 5
Easy to use app. Get quick access to local information on restaurants and fun activities.
Version 6.6 2012-12-15 5
Trip advisor is indispensable whenever I travel. Easy to use, reliable and accurate information.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-21 3
You get The basics but you lose a lot of the functionality from the website. Seems to me with a little bit of finagling, the software developers could get The app to offer the same functionality as the website.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 5
We use this app in planning our trips and while on our trips for restaurants, clubs and sightseeing! Great help!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-04 5
Really enjoyed using the site again on my iPad. Was able to rate a hotel in Assisi, Italy. Great for finding things to do and places to eat.
Version 5.8 2011-08-16 5
It shows me all the hotels in a specific area and it ranks them 1-20+ and shows me pics that guests took and how much rooms costal per night
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 1
This new version forces you to landscape mode on the iPad.  Emails to tech support asking why have gone unanswered.  Once you sign in with this app, it tracks everything you look at and basically starts to spam you with lots of junk about the place.

I like the service that TA offers but I don't like this app.  It has no settings of any kind, especially privacy.
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5
I have never used this app but heard nothing but wonderful things about it. So I uploaded it an LOVE it!! I can't stop looking for new things and places to eat..  Great App
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 5
My husband and I always use trip advisor before vacations! So much useful information.
Version 8.3 2013-12-30 5
The interface is easy to understand. Great application when travelling.

Version 6.3 2012-07-17 5
I'm always traveling, great use of this app when finding hotels, places to eat, and activities.
Version 6.4 2012-08-20 5
Great app that I actually prefer using over the website even when in front of a PC.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-18 5
I mostly use trip advisor on my laptop but have no issues with the app. It's a fantastic tool to get reviews on everything.
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 5
It's new and improved and so smooth to use, highly recommend If you like traveling! 5 stars!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5

When you are traveling you want to find places quickly and trip advisor does a very good job of guiding you to places fast and accurately. Thanks
Version 5.92 2012-01-30 5
I love this app!! I'm going on a cruise in a few months and now I can learn tons about all the different countries for free!! Kids and adults can use it too!
Version 6.4 2012-08-18 5
Don't travel anywhere without using this app to do your due diligence here first
Version 6.4 2012-08-23 5
Must have for iPhone or iPad when on vacation. Takes the guesswork out I trying new places. Very easy to navigate.
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
Planning a few upcoming trips and this app is great. Good way to compare hotels, find restaurants and list attractions to include in the itinerary.
Version 5.91 2012-01-15 5
I've used this app for several cities now and found it very accurate. My favorite use is the things to do.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 5
Love using this to get the facts about places before I spend a dime. Very helpful and has helped us avoid disasters.
Version 6.3 2012-08-12 5
Wouldn't plan or leave for a trip without...found the comments to be invaluable in planning for trip to London for Olympics.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 4
About as good as it gets for travel sites to date. When they can add social features like connecting me to interesting locals that have similar interests to mine this will be very very hot!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-11 2
This is app is really useful, but it freezes constantly. Want to view travelers pictures, freezes. Want to view pictures anywhere, the picture doesn't open, and when you want to close the pic window, it freezes. Just stopped using and went back to using the website. A must fix.
Version 8.5 2014-03-19 5
This is very well done, I've had no issues with it and the information is accurate.
Version 5.6 2011-06-15 4
I just got an IPAD2 after using a PC for all my working life.  This is the best APP that I've found--just in time for a month's trip which requires heavy trip planning.  It's so easy to use, even my wife enjoys it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
This is a great app for anyone needing a quick reference guide wherever you are traveling. Would highly recommend!
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
Thankfully, I had unknowingly downloaded a travel app that saved me a bundle of money and time. Used this for Myrtle Beach and it saved the week.
Version 5.8 2011-08-28 5
Lots of good features. Great organization of information. Only suggestion is that there should be a way to edit my profile in the app.
Version 5.8 2011-09-24 5
I am a frequent traveller for business and pleasure. I dont go anywhere without consulting tripadvisor
Version 6.5 2012-09-15 5
I always check out trip advisor when planning travel.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-01 5
Love having this on the road when traveling for work. Always leads me in the right direction!
Version 8.5 2014-03-01 5
Great app and the one I go to for searching places to visit when traveling. So far the reviews have been very helpful.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
Who loves to travel should have this app in your iPhone. It does exactly what you expect from a trip advisor. It is amazing.
Version 6.1 2012-04-11 5
This is a fine site as you have real folks opinions but read the reviews.  Do you really care if the doorman has halitosis?
Version 6.5 2012-09-23 4
Good mobile app. Wish I could access my previous reviews quickly but other than that I like it
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
Great source of information, invaluable when traveling
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 5
This app offers convenient access to Tripadvisers content. I use it quite a bit
Version 6.1 2012-04-30 5
We have consulted TripAdviser on several occasions for dining and lodging.  Halve never picked a bad one yet.  Glad we found this app.
Version 6.2 2012-07-10 5
Great way to look up everything you would need to know for planning a trip to any place in the world.
Version 6.6 2012-11-23 4
The majority of reviews are fair .. There is however a few biased and unreliable reviews due to third party reservations !! Stick with the actual hotel sites for better deals and amenities .
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 5
Using it to check out a 1000 islands vacation. Very helpful. Like reading the reviews of hotels, restaurants, etc. Love the picture posts, too.
Version 6.2 2012-07-21 5
Like how popular it is and that people post recent reviews that help make informed decisions.
Version 6.6 2012-10-31 5
This is the fan web site in the palm of your hand. Delivers the reviews, pix and info you seek on the site.
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 5
Great for travel reviews. Best hotel review site out there. Once at your destination, restaurant and "see" reviews are great (Yelp is not available internationally).
Version 5.92 2012-01-23 5
I always think that word-of-mouth reputation is the best kind. This app is awesome for that, and has helped find places to eat and stay when traveling.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-10 4
Needs a portrait view.

Add features available in the full web version such as adding the 'like' button for reviews and adding details on the reviewers.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
This was one of the two most used apps on my recent trip to Germany!  Keep up the great work.  Kudos to the dev team
Version 8.3 2014-01-07 5
Functional and tremendously helpful when traveling.  Easy to read and write reviews.
Version 5.8 2011-08-13 5
Tripadvisor is so great - perfect while traveling!  Well organized and not junked up...  Links to other sites...just helpful.
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 5
We have used this app regularly on our travels. Great resource for lodging, eats, and activities. Will continue to use for sure!
Version 6.2 2012-06-21 5
This is a perfect iPhone app. I look up info all the time on the fly. Reviews much better than yelp or open table
Version 6.3 2012-07-22 5
Trip advisor's app for iPhone is as good or better than their mobile website.
Version 6.6 2012-12-29 5
We really enjoy having so much information at our fingertips for travels near and far.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-04 5
I like trip advisor, one of the better reviews around. The app should be tweaked as it has some flaws.
Version 8.2 2013-12-24 5
My wife and I travel often and Tripadvisor is our go to app. Hands down the best source of info.
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 4
All of the information is compiled neatly, but perhaps an Advanced search feature (I.e. Search by inputs such as Pet-friendly, economy brackets, or stars/ratings)..
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 5
I'm gonna live in Indiana state and I need this app to make me know more about the place. The hotels prices are competitive and attractive, like it so much.
Version 5.8 2011-09-13 5
An absolute necessity when traveling to foreign cities & you don't know where to start looking for food or things to do. Love it!
Version 5.9 2011-12-17 5
It's a good application but it needs to remove the older and irrelevant reviews so as not to infuse travelers 
Photos from the official site would be a good idea too
Version 6.1 2012-04-23 4
I'm looking places to my travel to Mexico next month, it's being very easy to surf and see highlights on Mexico City. Would be a plus to see 3D images or 3D maps !!
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 4
So far I love being able to read reviews of places to eat and things to do. My only problem is that the rating system on the list page doesn't match the listings rating.
Version 6.5 2012-09-18 5
If you don't check-in with trip advisor before you pack your bags, you made a mistake!
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
I have had this app less than 24 hours, and I have already used to help me plan a couple of trips. I plan to use it even more!
Version 5.8 2011-08-12 5
Used this App to select our Dinner location today, and had a wonderful dining experience! I am a believer in ratings.
Version 5.8 2011-10-17 4
Very helpful ap. You can find most of the info you need before you take a trip to a new location. You'll find a soul who has the answer for your question.

Trip Advisor is a great resource! I have used it many times and have always been impressed with the vacations, restaurants, and hotels!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-03 5
Getting first hand ratings of what rocks and what doesn't is a real plus. Great way to get tips on what to see and do.
Version 5.6 2011-06-06 5
Nice, fluid motion. Easy access to everything the site has to offer, in an easy and convenient mobile format. Sharp and simply perfect.
Version 5.7 2011-07-26 5
I always use this for checking out hotel/B&Bs. No one will ever be more honest than someone who has actually stayed there!
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
If you don't want to waste time searching for places to go and offers ratings, this app is for you!
Version 6.2 2012-07-29 4
Love to read about places and hotels and that is how we go to new places by finding out about travels from other people who post their experiences and views of their stays at Hotels.
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 5
I never travel anywhere without first checking on trip advisor on tips on what to do or where to eat....love it!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-18 5
I love this app! It has been extremely helpful on my recent travels to find great places to eat and things to do.
Version 6.2 2012-07-23 5
The app is much improved and we always start the search here.
Version 7.0.1 2013-08-05 5
If you read carefully through the reviews, you can get a pretty good picture of the places.
Version 8.5 2014-02-24 4
Used it daily while in SW Florida. Very helpful. Only downside doesn't link to maps. Requiring an additional step. Also needs a camping rv choices
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
We cannot live and travel without trip adviser! Everything can be found there!!!' love this wonderful site!

I coordinated my whole trip to Jamaica with this app.  It has absolutely every thing you need to design your dream vacation.
Version 5.6 2011-05-17 5
I'm planning a two-month trip to Europe, and I've had a hard time finding cheap places to stay. This app has made my planning so much easier! I love it!
Version 5.6 2011-05-23 5
Absolutely great app!  We can sit in our hotel in Rome or any other place, and get current reviews of restaurants and hotels in distance ranked order.
Version 5.8 2011-09-27 5
I've used TA for years, but using it on the iPad is just plain terrific! It's simple and easy to use...thanks! I'll use TA even more now!
Version 6.2 2012-07-05 4
On a road trip from Seattle, WA to Miami, FL and I've used it no less than three times each day this week.  From hotels to restaurants and attractions....always helped me out.  The near me function is great!
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
Always listen to trip advisor they give the down and dirty of the best hotels and not so good ones. Very reliable !
Version 6.6 2013-03-23 4
You can check hotels and book them. This app picks up your location just on wifi and let's you learn about nearby restaurants, hotels or attractions. It is crowdsourcing at its best.
Version 5.9 2011-12-04 5
I would not have had nearly as amazing experiences without Trip Advisor, thank you, your a life saver!
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
New to me but looks great maybe it can guide me to the right place , things getting real old here.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
Enjoy! Tripadvisor is a great website and they delivered with a solid mobile app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-23 5
I love the trip advisor website and the app works just as well when I'm on the go. It's easy to read an write reviews, view photos etc on the app.
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 5
I recommend this ap to everyone and check it frequently when going out.
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 5
This app is very practical and you don't need to search anywhere else, because it will do it for you! 
Don't miss it!
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
Use it mostly to see what others think of hotels prior to booking them. Keep putting in those reviews. Thx!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-27 4
Delivers as advertised but does not have some of the same rating components as the site. Would like to gave access to the same profile materials as the site. Great job otherwise.
Version 5.7 2011-08-10 5
Used this app on a recent family road trip. Great way to check out hotels before booking.
Version 5.8 2011-10-26 5
Before I travel I shop around for the best prices and reviews. This one makes it so easy!

Great reviews that help you choose the best options for you and your family.

This is a great app for traveling. My wife and I used it multiple times on our recent trip to New Orleans. It pointed us to some great restaurants and tours/ attractions.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
Thank you tripadvisor!  You provide Greta information, I don't go on a trip without researching through your app!
Version 6.6 2013-02-07 2
Search engine not complete. Searched for house rentals in Healdsburg, CA. Having friends there, I know that there are more than 16 b&bs. Also no results for house rentals in the valley. Love trip advisor and use it often on the computer, but this app doesn't provide you with proper search options.
Version 6.3 2012-07-18 5
I have been in 3 cities in the last week an am very greatful for this app.  It is very easy to use and has not let me down.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
We use this app all the time to find things to do and restaurants around us along with traveler reviews.
Version 5.5 2011-04-18 5
I don't plan any trips without TripAdvisor. This iPhone app has put the icing on the cake. Now I can plan anywhere. Great app.
Version 5.5 2011-05-14 5
Excellent, useful, user-friendly app. Love it but wish it had a way to make ur own trip list from the ideas from other users.
Version 5.9 2011-12-12 4
It is an excellent application that was ver helpful for me when I was looking for good placed and best rated hotels.

The things I want to know in an easy format within a stable app...powerful and easy. Definitely recommended.
Version 5.92 2012-01-18 5
I  really think this application is very good thing to guide you , and make you know about any city before you visit it.
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
Used it to plan an anniversary trip and found it to be extremely helpful. Love that there were so many pictures of the sites!
Version 6.6 2012-10-13 5
I do a lot of traveling throughout the western United States and turn to this app time & time again for food and hotels. Easy to navigate.
Version 5.93 2012-03-03 5
Gives very good information and is helpful in a wide range of areas. Helps to plan out the best places to eat, sleep, shop, and attractions to see.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
Love TripAdvisor as a website and now as an app! The interface is easy and I've never experienced a problem with the app and I review a lot!
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Great app for travel.  Really helpful in narrowing down choices especially while you are traveling.  Great to use in the car.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 3
I saved a bunch of things for a recent trip in this App. I didn't realize you must have wifi access to view them. Why? Can't they be saved on my iPad? Otherwise this is awesome, but that was really frustrating when the hotel's wifi sucked.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-20 4
I haven't had a problem using this app. My only issue is that I can't figure out how to look at my own reviews after i've posted them.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-22 5
Very helpful so that I didn't have to go back and forth between different websites and apps. Great to use on the go!
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 4
You should be able to access your TripAdvisor account info but you cannot. Also it would be nice you were able to save searches so you didn't have to fill it in all the time.
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
Thee best app to use to finding the right hotel, hands down. The reviews are awesome, detailed and on the mark.  Try it out. You won't be disappointed.
Version 5.7 2011-08-05 4
I use Trip Advisor alot. This App is not quite as quick to navigate as the main site but I guess you can only fit so much on a smartphone screen. Definitely worthwhile however.
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
I use the application to give me ideas of where to visit and I appreciate travelers reviews rather than a travel brochure.
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
This app has been helpful with planning trips both short and long... even for finding local things to do in my area!
Version 6.2 2012-07-10 5
Making the most of your vacation with this handy app. Less wasted time and money!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Keeps the page open to forums or other pages u were reading.
Version 5.7 2011-06-25 5
I have always used Trip Advisor's website for my travels but now that it comes in a convenient app is even better!  Keep up the good work!
Version 5.92 2012-02-05 5

Works very well and the information has been accurate and valuable. I use it all the time.

Very helpful when visiting a new city and you want some opinions on hotels, restaurants and things to do (or not do)
Version 8.0.2 2013-12-28 5
I love this app and use it all the time! It has really helped me and my family during our travels. Don't leave home without it!
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-08 4
I like the reviews and took the time to add one myself for hotel after the first use. Some filters are missing compared with other search engines.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-23 5
You get honest review of people who have been there. You are able to weed our the whiners. I use this when I travel. I leave reviews wherever I go
Version 5.8 2011-08-27 5
This app helps really. Cut the time it takes to find a good place to eat, stay, or have fun!  We use it almost everyday!
Version 5.92 2012-02-11 4
Good content, easy navigation.  Tighter integration with Google Maps would round it out for me!  I've used this app in Europe and USA and it has made my trips much more enjoyable and rewarding
Version 6.6 2013-01-17 5
Your food or service in a restaurant are not good or excellent?  You can tell the world immediately with this great app.
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 5
I prefer the trip advisor app to their main site because it is simple to navigate and requires fewer pages to load to get the information I am seeking.
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
My husband and I used this app during our entire honeymoon. It's super fast & easy to use. So much so, that I still use it all the time & I'm a senior contributer!
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
This is a good app because you can look for hotels near by if needed . It is a fast way of searching for hotel.
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 5
We always check trip advisor before booking hotels. Highly recommended!
Version 6.6 2013-03-21 5
This app always comes with us! Very helpful to have. Glad to have a review site like this.
Version 5.92 2012-01-20 5
The app is helpful. I use the site all the time but the app is more convenient for immediate information. I never plan a trip without TA, never.
Version 5.91 2012-03-26 5
Love the website and love the app just as much!! Just booked a hotel for my next vacation using this app! Works great
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 5
A good app to have if you were going on a road trip. Check it out first at trip advisor before spending your hard earned buck!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5
So helpful covering a specific location then showing all my options in the area
Version 5.5 2011-05-24 4
Trip Advisor itself can't be beat.  The appis a little less functional than the basic web site (which is easy to navigate on an iPad) because it annoyingly inserts the map even when you don't need it.
Version 5.6 2011-06-07 5
A must have app for all travelers, visitors and great resource for planning a trip whether for things to do, hotels, restaurants or getting reviews. Great overall!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 5
One of the applications I now check before any trip. I travel almost weekly and always use TA input on hotels.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
This is a sweet app. I like getting other people's opinions on restaurants and things to do, but I love even more giving my opinion when I'm somewhere new!
Version 5.92 2012-02-06 4
This should be an enormous help in planning my upcoming trip to Ireland!  Restaurants, hotels, and especially "things to do" will greatly de-stress my trip of a lifetime! Wait until I tell my fellow traveler, cousin Val!
4 stars!
Version 6.1 2012-05-31 5
Very easy to use when quickly changing  travel plans on the fly.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-13 5
This app offers helpful advice in an easy to use format.  If had helped steer me to hidden gems and avoid prominent traps.
Version 5.6 2011-05-27 5
Great site, I've been using more and more often, it's been providing us very valuable information.
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
This app works very smoothly.  Information is clear and easily viewed.
Version 5.8 2011-09-18 5
Always comes through for me - on family vacations and business trips.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 4
Very useful app to use when traveling and planning out the days events. The only improvement would be to include the meal prices for restaurants like the webpage does.
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 4
It's always worth checking on trip advisor before booking anything and this app makes it easy when on the go.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5

A life saver for any sort of travel. App is normally quick. It's easy to use. Also easy to post photos and reviews.
Version 5.7 2011-07-22 5
Love the reviews...get an idea of what people think; however review date of review...found that older reviews are not always accurate
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5

Wouldn't go anywhere or stay anywhere  without checking. Tripadvisor first

I like to search using this app. When I am looking for a place to eat while traveling I like to know how it is rated.
Version 6.6 2013-01-19 5
Great for finding hotels, restaurants.  Especially helpful when traveling to new place.
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5

Excellent app. Search tool is easy to use. Real-time reviews by actual customers is invaluable.
Version 5.7 2011-07-25 5
The only site that I check before we travel anywhere. It is the most reliable source to get excellent info.
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 5
I've only had it 15 mins, but have managed to confidently avoid various street advertisers and their "great deals". Thanks!
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
I've relied on trip advisor for years and it's never led me wrong. The app is as good as the site and the interface is easy to use
Version 6.1 2012-06-18 5
Absolutely amazing app!!!! Never need the full website, very useful app. I always use TripAdvisor for every vacation
Version 6.3 2012-08-17 5
Helpful when planning a trip or just enjoying my own town!
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
Use this app on a regular basis.  App works well and the Trip Advisor is a consistently reliable source of good info and reviews.
Version 7.0 2013-05-02 4
I just wish that the map on the right wasn't so large since it takes up too much viewing space leaving the hotel listings on the left too tiny, small.
Version 5.8 2011-09-24 5
I am absolutely dependent on this site whether traveling or staying close to home. TripAdvisor has yet to miss on it's restaurant recommendations!
Version 6.1 2012-05-04 5
Great app use this while traveling or just simply dinning out. Reviews of business seem to be right on.
Version 6.6 2013-02-12 5
I always use this to find restaurants near me when I am traveling.  Works great and reviews are usually on the mark.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-07 3
There's a lot of user limitations to the app. Love trip advisor online but why can't I go back and add pics with my phone or see reviews I've posted. I'd also like to change settings but can't :/ otherwise pretty helpful
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
Very fictional user interface. Very very useful app. Just look at how many stars most ppl give it. Knuff said!
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 5
Great app.  Only thing I could imagine making it better would be if it also provided gas station prices.
Version 5.7 2011-07-14 5
I check trip advisor before I travel anywhere. Most honest reviews I have found. The app is easy to use. Love it!
Version 5.92 2012-02-06 5
Best place to stay at in Pattaya Thailand , friendly STAFF and best pool CREW for KIDS ,good food , and the BEST of All is the Kings Club with the Lounge what a service if i had 6 STARS they would have it

Definitely my go to!!!
Love, Love, LOVE!!!
Version 5.0 2010-05-21 4
The new update changing it to all of Tripadvisor versus just restaurants makes a huge difference. It is a lot easier to find information and write reviews from the phone.
Version 5.5 2011-04-30 5
Don't stay anywhere without it..helps to know additional charges that some hotels don't advertise!!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
A great tool to use when planning your vacation or just looking for something to do or eat around the towns you live in!
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
Great App, it shows you what's going and what you can do on while your on your vacation. No need to google anything for your trips.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 4
Great app to have while traveling. Recently used in Amsterdam and had a great time because of this app. Looking forward to using it in San Antonio and my hometown of Chicago.
Version 8.2 2013-11-30 5
The best travel info supported with google maps makes travel easy!
Version 5.7 2011-07-14 5
Love the app.  Perfect travel companion.  Love the community updates when it comes to restaurants etc...  So far, never disappointed.
Version 6.1 2012-04-18 4
Needs ability to filter by amenities (pet friendly, etc) Would then be invaluable for searching for hotels on the fly. Or add ability to save amenity preferences to your profile.
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
Very useful, just used it on a trip to Colombia, every hotel and restaurant we visited had the descriptions from Trip Advisor.
Version 6.6 2013-03-18 5
Love TripAdvisor. The app is easy to use and great for planning ahead or quick checks during the trip.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-09 5
Extremely useful for finding things to do both before & during traveling!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Very helpful for me! Love the reviews for helping me find places when I don't have a guide book with me
Version 5.6 2011-06-20 5
Perfect for planning a trip. This app let's me find things to do and places to eat in any place and then save them so I don't need to write everything down! It's so convienient.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
We have found so many hidden gems by using this app. Has a great interface and is really reliable & useful!
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
My sister lives in florida and so I go down there a lot.... I can get good fight prices ... And I can even book them from my IPod :) best thing ever
Version 5.92 2012-02-15 5
Before taking our trip to Tahiti I used Trip Advisor and it made all the difference in the world will never travel with out using it first!!!!
Version 6.5 2012-09-23 5
I travel for a living & I love rating every hotel I stay at!  This app lets me get the word out on good and bad places quickly & easily!
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 5
In Madrid, nyc, and hopefully in venice! Many can give you great monuments, but only TA gives you great places to eat!
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-05 5
I always check trip advisor when I want accurate info on places I may be going! Great app!!
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
I've used it for hotels and restaurants and always gotten good advice.  This is one of my favorite apps, especially when I'm traveling.
Version 5.9 2011-12-18 5
Nothing beats just giving something a try, but when you've got 7 people to keep happy, this app is a great way to start
Version 6.4 2012-08-21 5
I use this app frequently to check out places to stay, restaurants and sights to see. Appreciate people's honesty.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-28 2
When searching for "things to do" in a given area, the app shows places/attractions that are not even close by. For example, a search for things to do in and around Sacramento pulls up a result from Catalina island. It even shows that result as being located a little bit north of Sacramento!!
Version 8.1 2013-11-10 5
It works just as well or better than the site. A great app for any vacation or travel experience.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 4
I love being able to search hotels and attractions and then being able to save information that would be relevant to my trip planning.
Version 5.9 2012-01-04 5
This has proved to be a really fantastic app and resource for travel. Restaurants, hotels, attractions, you name it, you can get good info from real folks. Love it!
Version 5.92 2012-01-27 5
A very helpful application which I should use more often. Recommend it to everyone who does not have an iPhone.
Version 6.6 2012-10-21 5
Very helpful. Have not had any problems with it so far. Accurate where I live as well as on my recent vacation to Colorado.
Version 6.6 2012-12-23 5
We would not travel without it.  We use it all the time to check out accommodations, restaurants and things to see and do.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 2
The application is very slow, with poor scrolling and window management.  Restaurant categories are often incorrect.  The built in "browser" that takes you to the TripAdvisor web site is marked as "incompatible."  Not ready for prime time.  Needs work.
Version 5.8 2011-08-19 5
Fantastic just like trip advisor, now I look for restaurants nearly everyday for travel or in my home town.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Always check Trip Advisor when traveling, and this app works just fine. Very handy.
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 5
This app is very user friendly. Great when traveling or at home and you want to find something fun to do..
Version 6.3 2012-07-21 5
Easy to use and informative. Wouldn't book a vacation without checking it first.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Love this app!  Found so many places we would have missed otherwise!  The point me there tool really worked!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
The most helpful app and works everywhere you go
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
I have been using iPhone and iPad apps for years. This is the first review I ever wrote. 
I love this amazing app, so user friendly and functionally elegant!
Version 5.7 2011-07-05 5
This app is easier to navigate on than the website itself. Makes planning for my vacation waaaayy easier!!
Version 6.1 2012-07-01 4
This app does a great job of pulling together the information I need to plan a vacation. 
I just wish I could access the information offline.
Version 6.6 2013-01-26 5
We love to travel both locally and internationally. Use this app every time.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5

Version 6.5 2012-11-15 5
On our recent road trip through the UK, this site guided us to the best places - 5 stars :)
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-03 3
I used to enjoy reading and writing reviews and answers to questions. The new "improvements" make moving on the the next question after answering one very difficult. It discourages contributions.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 2
I would give this app five stars but you need a back button. I love trip advisor and use your app daily for different trips I have planned. This new update makes it impossible to go back.  You have to start over when ever searching the forums. Please fix!
Version 5.5 2011-05-01 5
As a seasoned global traveler it's one of the first places I turn when setting out. It always helps me get past the advertised hype.
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 4
Much smother than just web browsing and it's nice to be able to look for stuff based on rating or map locations on the same user interface without it been cumbersome.
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 5
I trust this review site more than any other. Trip Advisor has never steered me wrong.  I hope you're around for many years to come TA!
Version 6.6 2013-02-23 5
I love this app as a companion to the website. Best travel app ever. Ever ever. Don't go anywhere without reading some reviews first!
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
Mostly helpful, but sometimes the descriptions are unclear and they don't have updated website links
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 5
I never go traveling with out using this app first. This app has helped me find numerous hotels and places to visit.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
Trip Advisor has always been extremely helpful when traveling. The app doesn't disappoint!
Version 5.9 2012-01-14 5
We use this app almost daily for our honeymoon. Looking for restaurants and other cool things to do. It was incredibly helpful
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 5
This app and the website have helped me plan many a trip. Thanks for many great ideas and vacations.
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 5
Absolutely a must have for planning a trip! You have access to restaurants, attractions, and hotels with reviews!
Version 5.8 2011-11-05 4
Pls add function to display multiple saved sites with option to search for directions among them, thanks.
Version 5.93 2012-03-11 5
An outstanding tool for planning and having an enjoyable travel experience.  I rely upon it and it delivers ... always!
Version 6.6 2012-12-21 3
The app requires a 200 character count in order to submit a review?ridiculous. Sometimes less is more than sufficient. I used to review frequently but will certainly do no more if this app is constrained by a minimum character count...
Version 8.4 2014-03-06 5
I use it all the time when I'm trying to navigate and find the best restaurants and lodging in the mean streets of Compton, California
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
It's a fast efficient way to find advice on lodgings and restaurants around the corner from where I live or around the world.
Version 5.8 2011-10-02 5
Great app that is easy to use and has come in very handy looking for restaurants in Scotland, Belgium and germany on our recent Europe trip
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 5
Great App. We travel a lot and the recommendations are accurate and up to date. Don't leave home without it! Maps are terrific as well.
Version 5.9 2011-12-31 5
I always check w/ trip advisor before booking and now I have it right on my phone!!!
Version 5.92 2012-02-10 5
Gives us all we need when getting ready to visit new places.  Reviews especially helpful.
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 5
I have enjoyed so many restaurants and activities I never would seen if not for TA- I even use it in my own hometown.  Thanks:)
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 5
Provides the custom-orientated reviews. what I love so much is the negative reviews which avoid experience disppoint.
Version 6.4 2012-09-01 5
I love this app and use it all the time on trips. Definitely the quickest and easiest way to determine the best (and worst) restaurants, hotels, and attractions.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-11 5
App is great when looking something up on the go. Website is better for more detailed research.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 4
Always there for me when I'm deciding where to eat or if I need a hotel wherever I may be roaming. My favorite place to add and read reviews.
Version 8.3 2014-01-05 5

Version 5.6 2011-07-07 4
I travel for work and play and absolutely love this ap! The restaurant reviews are fabulous and I usually refer to it to make my plans while traveling abroad.  I just wish it was connected to my gps.
Version 6.6 2013-01-07 3
I often seek advice and info via the forum and it does not flow seemlessly as on the website.  You cannot save forum favorites (like a city) and cannot switch between forum and hotel listings.  I do still use it though.
Version 6.6 2013-02-21 4
Great to have at your fingertips.  Searching and results-sorting capability somewhat limited.  App is not very dynamic, but design is clean and relatively easy to navigate.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-24 5
I could spend hours looking through this app and dreaming of vacation
Version 5.8 2011-08-12 5
I love this app since I travel quite a bit international. It keeps me up to date with everything it's a must have if you love to travel as I do.
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
Amazing app finds all the cheapest flights. Makes this a huge convenience as opposed to searching online. Easy to use.
Version 5.8 2011-11-12 5
This is the most reliable best organized app with the most current info out there
Version 6.6 2012-11-05 5
Use it all the time when traveling and it makes writing reviews very quick and easy.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
We check TripAdvisor before any new vacation for "what to do" & "where to go" ideas.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-29 2
This app is terrible.  Impossible to filter when searching for hotels.  Every time you go back to the list of hotels you have to re-enter all of the filters all over again.  Does not let you clear dates.  Just impossible to use for certain things.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Makes planning a trip a breeze as well as finding things near to your current location!
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
So far so good.  I've used this app on trips to Los Angeles, La Jolla and San Francisco and it has been very useful in finding great lodging, restaurants and things to do.
Version 5.9 2011-11-12 5
First thing I turn to when we travel to a new place. Helps so much to hear what others think and to find out where to go. I love it
Version 6.4 2012-08-31 5
We've used the app almost exclusively since we first downloaded it. Especially useful DURING a trip.
Version 6.6 2012-11-10 5
Great app. It does everything the website does. Haven't had a problem with it. I like that I can review places right from the app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-22 5
Helping me find the best stuff to do or eat.  I like to go on "adventures" and this app is the best for reading reviews on motels/hotels.

Version 5.5 2011-04-17 5
Trip advisor can tell you anything you need to know about any location you plan on traveling to. It's a great resource for any traveler.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
The app is very intuitively laid out and makes finding anything very quick and easy.  Love it!
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-07-13 5
I don't care if you travel for business or if you travel for pleasure this is a must-have iPhone app!
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
Such a great tool to have while traveling.  Have found so many new, fabulous places!
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
It's helpful & I love how I can add to a place to help the review of a place be more accurate. I recommend this app for anyone taking a vacation.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
Makes my trips much easier, you find everything you need in just seconds!

Fantastic App. Tells you what you need to know about anything travel related without any hidden agendas.
Version 5.93 2012-02-25 5
I utilize tripadvisor for every trip we take. It has the best advice for both domestic and foreign trips. Highly recommend.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 5
Enjoy the convenience of Tripadvisor on your mobile device. Easy to use and helpful.
Version 6.6 2013-01-24 3
Confused in categories and classification it is not easy to understand why a location with 10 reviews can be better than one with 40 with more excellent reviews. That can be quite misleading . Otherwise the app itself runs well
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-02 3
I give more weight to reviews submitted by individuals who have submitted multiple reviews. This app only gives the name of the reviewer. Please consider adding the amount of reviews submitted next to the reviewer's name.
Version 7.0.1 2013-08-14 5
It did a good job of searching hotel and flight rates. No need to check through multiple apps
Version 8.2 2013-12-04 5

Version 8.5 2014-03-28 5
Tripadvisor is a great resource and this app is wonderful when on the go!  Great way to find places nearby on the fly.

Trying to find pics of a room online in the hotels site did not find any but found them here 5 stars!!!! Keep up te good work!!!! Love it
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 5
I love trip advisor. You can type in a city and state and find attractions or hotels. The reviews are always so helpful and the app works great.
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
Easy to navigate and true comment from people that stayed in the hotel a lot of facts with real pictures.
Version 5.5 2011-05-05 5
I've been a member for a long time and so it's nice to have this app for quick access to reviews and forums.
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5
It is a great app to know which hotel to pick and to stay in and to know all of the reviews about them :)
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
This app is great!  You can find pretty much everything anywhere you want to go.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
We live on Germany and travel often.  We love this app, makes our section making process much easier.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 1
This update negates the usefulness of the previous app. It does not know where yo are at any more and does not provide location service. 

In the previous version you could scroll the map and see your desired categories update on screen. This version no longer does that. You have to type in a cityor location. Totally useless when yo are traveling
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 4
I love this app...great for planning trips.  Only thing missing are numbers on the maps...get a list of hotels but no way to tell which hotel goes with which pin...unless you select each one.
Happy tripping!
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
Very well put together, organized, and accurate. Highly recommend.
Version 5.92 2012-01-27 5
I love it!  Me & my hubby decided to take a family trip to New Mexico and Trip Advisor has allowed me to plan our trip on the go! So awesome

I love this App it helps me a lotwhen travelling, specially if you take your time to read the reviews!  These are from real people, not critics! I love it!
Version 5.5 2011-04-15 5
Contains a lot of tourist information as well as real people's reports about mentioned places of interest. Plus: maps & tips. A say: VERY GOOD.
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 5
i always consult trip advisor when i am planning on taking a trip, for pleasure or business. very informative.
Version 6.2 2012-07-03 5
Could be more stable but honestly not an issue. Just needs more reviews.
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 5
Very convenient with all the same features as regular tripadvisor.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
Gives great advice for saving money while traveling, and I get to find out about the attractions before I go! Love this app!!!
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 5
Just like website, gives great feedback so you always know what you're in for!
Version 5.92 2012-01-18 5
I prefer the website while at home, but this app is excellent while on the go! 

Thanks TripAdvisor team; keep up the good work
Version 5.92 2012-02-17 4
This is a good app for when you are planning, or traveling. I usually use it in combo w/ another app to crosscheck. Sometimes a company will have friends & family write reviews.
Version 6.1 2012-04-04 5
I use this app on my iPhone and my iPad. I encourage everyone to give it a shot at any travel need. You will not be disappointed,
Sgt Scott

What a great app! I love how it shows you what's nearby.I travel quite a bit and use this often. Thanks!
Version 5.9 2011-12-14 5
Love it. Just what I needed not just for visiting new cities but also to know more about my own.
Version 5.9 2012-01-09 5
Easy to use and great info from flights to hotel reviews and things to do! A definite must have for any traveler seasoned or not!
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 1
Loaded app on iPad2.  Wrote a medium length review and couldn't get signed in so sent for a password reset.  Review disappeared while signing in again.  I love writing reviews twice.  I want to do that all the time.

It's also hard to get back to the settings screen.  You get in home screen and have to hit My Saves to get the settings button.  Tooo weak.  I'll stick with the browser site.
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 1
I've used TripAdvisor on many trips, and love using the "near me now" feature when walking unknown streets. 

Imagine my frustration -- this trip -- when it told me that it now requires and Internet connection. 

Internet? While walking thru town looking for dinner? What are they thinking?!

PS: But up till now it was five-stars.
Version 6.6 2012-10-19 5
It's a great app! Well worth it, especially when on or planing a trip it makes it simple to know what's around the area and what to do..
Version 6.6 2012-12-01 5
This is the one app I use everyday.  When I travel, I rely on this app (and all of you) to guide me to the best places to stay and eat!  A must have.
Version 8.3 2013-12-28 5
Does everything the website but smoother, quicker and with more clarity.  Love it
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
We ended up having to scramble for reservations after a drastic last minute change in plans.  This app was invaluable.
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 5
Really nice app for traveling to parts unknown.  Real world reviews that are perfect for finding just the right place to go.
Version 6.6 2013-02-26 5
I've utilized trip advisor as my new "go to" place for honest, impartial reviews. They haven't let me down :-)
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 4
Should have better mapping abilities. Find myself tapping expecting a map to ask for directions so I can find the restaurant. Otherwise great app.
Version 5.9 2011-12-19 2
It's probably better to use this app to look up reviews of specific places. When I try to browse hotels in a city, if I go into the reviews section of any hotel, there is no way to go back to all the hotels in that city (the back button takes me to the homepage). I repeatedly have to search the same city.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
Comprehensive and thorough without being overly complicated.  This is what travel apps should be.
Version 5.9 2012-02-05 5
Love TripAdvisor, the app is super helpful. I haven't booked a trip in years without checking TA first!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-15 5
I always check tripadvisor before a trip for all me travel needs
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-22 5
Trip advisor has never disappointed! Use it all the time to find great stuff. Thank you to all the great reviewers out there!
Version 5.9 2011-11-07 4
But I wish I could see all my past reviews and my profile as well. Seems to be more focused on future bookings or on the go, but iPad is a little different in my opinion.
Version 5.7 2011-08-06 5
I am loving the app since downloading. I've used tripadvisor on my home computers for years. It's great to now have it "on the road" with me.
Version 5.9 2011-12-28 5
I have an upcoming trip and the reviews already have helped me plan on what to see and what not to see! Very very helpful!
Version 5.92 2012-02-12 5
Wherever I go, near home or far away travel, it's spot on in finding what I'm looking for with very useful info and reviews.
Version 5.93 2012-02-26 5

Version 6.4 2012-09-01 5
I travel extensively; this app is utilised almost daily, for hotel reviews & food, to places to see to kill time.
Version 5.91 2012-01-24 5

Version 5.4 2011-05-16 5
All the great trip advisor info without waiting for the pages to load.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 4
I've been using this app for a while. Love the content but there's some bugs that need to be addressed after this last update. I much preferred previous version.
Version 6.1 2012-04-10 5
Perfect app for finding anything when you're traveling. Was perfect for finding food nearby, even in South America.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-18 5
We use this to plan our trips and vacations. Love the reviews from other users.
Version 8.5 2014-03-10 5
Great way to check out resorts. Find out if other people have had problems at resorts.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-18 5
I use this app for ALL of my trip planning! Great for hotel booking and trip research! Can't recommend it highly enough!
Version 5.7 2011-06-30 5
Must have if you travel. Get real reviews and photos. Saved us many times from getting a loser property.
Version 6.3 2012-08-01 4
Great simple app. Only issue I have is can't log into Facebook through the app. Get error from FB that it's TA issue. 
Fix that and it's golden. :-)
Version 6.6 2012-11-25 5
Awesome app. I highly recommend it. Saved us lots of time and helped us find two great hidden dining gems in upstate NY.
Version 6.6 2012-12-21 5
There are many apps for many places but for world travel in general, trip advisor is the best
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-21 5
This is what's needed so I don't waste my time and money going to places that have lousy food, & awful customer service
Version 5.92 2012-02-04 5
I use this whenever I go anywhere new, ever since I was stuck in the worst bar in Kansas city and TA helped us find an amazing brew pub and saved the evening
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 5
I use trip advisor at home when I want to read reviews about restaurants in the next town or state
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-18 5
Love this app. It ll take you to the right place.... I used during my South America trip to Colombia Peru Bolivia and Argentina to locate hostels.
Version 5.9 2011-12-20 5
I have only had the app for half a day and I have found it useful in researching an upcoming vacation.  Just added it to an iPhone too.
Version 6.3 2012-09-09 5
I use it a lot when planning my trips, and the reviews are usually very accurate.
Version 6.6 2012-10-21 5
Never take a trip without checking out this app. It's just perfect.
Version 8.2 2013-11-30 5
I really like that you can look up hotels, restaurants, and things to do in one place. Defiantly got me out of a jam!
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Download individual city apps so you don't need wifi or data. Cannot travel without this app.
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 5
When I want a review I can depend on, and to compare others points of view and make up my mind, Trip Advisor is my #1 "go to" source.
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
While planning our vacation to the Pacific Northwest, we used Trip planner exclusively. It's a great website and a nice iPad app.
Version 5.92 2012-02-02 5
This is without a doubt the best travel app on the market. Nothing comes close. I use it all the time, and not just for traveling.
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 3
Overall the app is great. One thing that bothers me though is that there is no "share" button so I can send via email or text message their listings. That is a big drawback to me. But, anyway, enjoy the rest of the features. I still like the app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-16 5
Trip advisor is the best ...i always check  places , hotels, restaurants in trip advisor before going anywhere..
Version 5.6 2011-06-25 5
Works as intended. Wish there a search function for hotel name too, not just city. Convenient to have when traveling.
Version 5.8 2011-09-06 5
I think I spent 3 hours on it today researching places to visit; it's a great app, easy to use, loads of info. Highly recommend it for travelers!!
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
If your new to an area, this app will give you real reviews and suggestions from real people.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 5
Very reliable, easy to use. I have never been steered wrong with the advice I learned through Trip Advisor.
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
Very functional app. Has the basics you need and works smoothly on iPhone.
Version 6.6 2013-04-07 5
Information up to date  well organized and easily accessed.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
This app is a virtual travel agency come tour guide! It was a breeze to view attractions, accomodations and to book all from one place.
Version 5.8 2011-10-02 5
I am in the navy, we travel all over the world and this is a great app to look for new places and great deals!  Awesome app that makes travel fun!
Version 5.9 2011-12-20 3
Cons: I would give it 4 stars but it uses the Internet to load ANYTHING instead of having it downloaded. When you close out the app automatically resets. Pros: if you have Internet it'll have all the information the main website has.
Version 5.92 2012-01-20 5
Always has great info for getting the cheapest flights possible and has great hotel information too!
Version 5.8 2011-08-11 5
As a frequent traveler I use this app to look for hotels that meet my needs and stay away from those who don't.
Version 5.9 2011-11-13 5
You don't need to read the reviews, it's very simple, and easy to use. If you like traveling you'll like this app.
Version 5.8 2011-11-24 5
Never go anywhere new, or anywhere you have not visited recently, without consulting Trip Advisor
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 5
I travel quite a bit for business and leisure and started using TripAdvisor to find places to eat and visit. Thanks.
Version 6.5 2012-09-25 5
Just the very most useful tool when you travel.  Review the thoughts of your fellow travelers and hit the road!
Version 6.6 2012-12-11 5
This is my favourite restaurant in the whole world and usually i love to go on my birthday on march 12 please remember me do it what I say
Version 6.6 2013-01-01 5
Fantastic app easy to use. Love it when I travel or when looking for something new to do or see.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-15 5
This is my go to travel app when looking for restaurants and things to do. Much better than Yelp.
Version 6.1 2012-04-11 5
We are using the iPad version during a tour of the North-East US we are having now, and it's very useful, easy to use and helpful!
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
Much easier to use than the website on a browser. I highly recommend this app!
Version 6.6 2013-03-16 5
Have had no problems with the app. I use and trust trip advisor all the time for traveling or even locally. I'm a fan!!
Version 8.2 2013-12-01 3
App should be much much better, can't go 1/2 of what you can online, can't post pictures,can't see my profile or past reviews, can't even give detailed ratings, needs to be much improved
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
I Love how helpful this app is,I am very " pleased with how informative it is, and I will continue to keep it on my list of favorite preferences.
Version 5.9 2011-12-02 5
Handy app no matter where you are, you can always find something new
Version 6.1 2012-06-04 5
I've got a whole lot of like for this here app.   It's got maps, hotels, things to do, and restaurants with ratings.  It also has flight info.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I've been using Tripadvisor for a few years now to find good hotels. Nice to have it as an app, a very good resource.
Version 6.6 2012-12-15 1
When asked to select check in and out dates for the hotel , I can not select a check out date that is within 30 days from my check in date. The funny thing is that the note to user advise the other way around. It asks to select a Check out date only within the 30 days from check in date! But u can't because all those 30 dates are all grey out .
Version 5.5 2011-08-10 5
This app is literally everything I need to plan a trip outside of my city, or even in my city for that matter.  Can't recommend it enough.
Version 5.9 2011-10-28 5
Such a cool tool to have , what's even great is getting a view of things as both street & photos and there comments .

Very helpful
Version 6.1 2012-04-22 5
Love reading what other people's experiences are when choosing places to stay and visit. I think it helps optimize time spent in new places.

I absolutely love this app. It truly has everything and allows me to dream of some pretty awesome trips.

Version 5.7 2011-08-14 5
I always research feedback for trips etc and the phone AP makes it great for unexpected times out too
Version 5.9 2011-12-18 5
I really like this app, it's helpful and quick and does a very thorough job
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 5
Good app great app love it is different from the other app it gives u the chance to search restrants and things to do+hotels
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
I have used Trip Advisor all over the US to scope out things to do and places to eat. The reviews are always helpful and pretty accurate.
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 5
We use to book our vacations and reviews from travelers are very helpful.  App works great!
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5
I have used trip advisor for a number of years for travel. Now use the iPad app all the time! User friendly and ratings generally spot on.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 4
I use a lot the website and now this app, would be good to have access to information of the foruums and reviews sent on local languages like the spanish forums and reviews.
Version 5.5 2011-05-01 5
This app is the best. Its so helpful especially since I have a vacation coming up out of the country! Can't wait to enjoy the island thanks to trip advisor!
Version 5.6 2011-06-01 4
Great app! Just keep in mind that a lot of people who take the time to write lengthly negative reviews are probably the same people who complain about everything no matter what.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
I travel a lot for work and sometimes don't have the time to look for the best places but that's when I pull out trip advisor and Buallaaaaa!!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-29 5
On vacation right now and using it to plot our next stop. My daughter recommended it and now I wouldn't be without it.
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
Just downloaded and already planning for some restaurants to try.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 4
My only beef is that not all of the places found (specifically restaurants) were mapped. Otherwise very user friendly. Like the link to the place's website too.
Version 6.6 2012-10-04 5
Easy to use, accurate info, wide range of businesses. I use this app even to choose businesses in my own city.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 2
Please please do not put a back "home" button at the top where people are used to hitting back. No one is used to hitting "back" at the bottom of the screen like that! Seriously frustrating having to constantly re navigate to what I was just looking at due to the poor design.
Version 8.5 2014-03-22 5
Excelent use it for almost everything
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Just started using this apparent and really enjoying it. Great compliment to website.  User friendly!
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
I love the site and app.  I usually know exactly what to expect when I travel.  Thanks everyone for your input!
Version 6.0 2012-03-22 5
I use it before all vacations, I also enjoy writing reviews!
Version 6.6 2012-10-01 4
Despite occasional property reviews that are poles apart, the site provides a good glimpse of what you're likely to find at hotels and restaurants.  That is worth a great deal to me.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-25 4
I find it easy to use -very easy to open and write a review. Sure the web-site is faster but it's my cell phone and I can find things pretty quickly.  I like it
Version 6.0 2012-03-30 5
Everyone who goes anywhere needs this app
Version 6.5 2012-09-15 5
I have found so much great information on this site. Thank you for making it simple and free to use.
Version 5.6 2011-06-01 3
Planning the families trips is made easier with my Trip Advisor app. Everything at my fingertips and I truly appreciate the reviews of others as well as their pictures. I am a little leery that reviews came from actual guests and not hired reviewers or staff.
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 5
Highly recommend this app! Enjoy the ability to travel now while you have the means and FREEDOM to do so I say.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 4
This app helped identify attractions on recent trip to San Fran. But sometimes screen froze and there are some peculiar aspects to the interface. Used both on iPhone and iPad.
Version 6.4 2012-08-21 4
The app has been very helpful. Only suggestion, make website links pop-out to (device) browser (vs in-app browser.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Always use this app to research my trips before booking... I have used it since 2005.  Great app!
Version 6.6 2012-11-30 1
This application is not functioning properly with the iPad after multiple attempts.  It continually bumps me from my current location to a generic world location.  I just go back to the Internet versus trying to use this application.  I hope that you get the bugs fixed soon because this can be a very valuable application if it works properly.
Version 5.7 2011-07-05 5
This is a great tool to have. We can always check where to stay or Where to eat minimizing the bad experience opportunities. I love it!'
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
Provides quick options for what you need when traveling whether on foot or on the freeway.
Version 5.93 2012-03-03 4
Nice app, like the layout and it's easy to use and add reviews.  However, there is no way to add locations to rate.  Need to check this feature on the website, however, that would be a nice addition.
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 4
Overall a pretty good app. I like the options available, including maps w sat. Imagery. Nice to see hotels, restaurants and points of interest and activities available. Thumbs up!
Version 6.6 2013-04-10 5
The traveler's best friend! Be sure to register so you can save interesting places while trip planning.
Version 8.2 2013-12-06 2
I love their website, but the app is lacking some ability to control. Where is the list of my reviews and why can't I edit them on here? What about all the other options that we can check online when submitting a review? Could be so much better.
Version 5.8 2011-10-15 4
Works great finding restaurants, but lacks English translations. I am in Japan and reviews are in Japanese . Cutting them and placing into a translator takes time. I love the "live" feature.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
The trip advisor app is very easy to navigate and contains a wealth of information at your fingertips.
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 5
This service is the best.  We rely on itt for our travel.  The app does a good job getting you to the key information.
Version 6.1 2012-06-30 5
Great app for finding the amenities at European hotels while on a tour. Do they had Internet access, breakfast, etc, etc.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 4
Best of the bunch I've tried so far, all of which have room for improvement.  TripAdvisor is likely the best /mobile/ app of its kind available.
Version 6.6 2013-05-29 5
I can't travel without this app. It's so nice to read all the reviews so we can make informed decisions.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 5
If I don't take a look at this App I think about the place twice.  Great App and features.  Two thumbs up!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-11 5
One thing they should do is that I complained about some comments and they are responding or taking it dow.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 4
I love the reviews by travelers and I don't book a hotel without first reading all the reviews of that hotel. I trust other travelers like me to be honest and steer me right. This is the best site for that!
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 5
Simple as that. There's not much to say because that's all I need in a travel app like this. Very transparent as well!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 4
I would only recommend that the user interface and navigation is beefed up and made a little more enhanced and user friendly.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-18 5
I love that the reviews are by actually travelers and locals alike. Would use over yelp any day.
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 5
So easy and helpful. I always check Trip Advisor before vacation. It's nice to have on the go.
Version 5.93 2012-03-10 5
Flights, hotel, and things to do, ect.
Could not ask for anything else
From an app to practically plan 
Out your entire trip!
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 2

Version 5.5 2011-04-25 5
My husband and my trip to Beijing was success due to the wonderful, accurate recommendations from Trip Advisor.
Version 5.8 2011-10-23 5
Can't get enough of this app. Helpful every time I travel or to find local things I haven't heard of.
Version 5.92 2012-02-16 5
Nothing but the best from the world's best travel site - can't start your hotel shopping anywhere else!
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 5
Everything that is reviewed is spot on. We just traveled to NZ and everything we did was great
Version 6.6 2012-10-21 2
I love the website. Everything about it works perfectly. I researching Costa Rica, and somehow the app is giving only a small upset of what's available on the website. There's no reason to use the app-- the website works better on he iPad in every dimension.
Version 5.8 2011-08-30 5
This app has single handedly made this a great trip.   Spot on for every review.   When I get home I will add lots of pics and reviews
Version 5.8 2011-10-10 5
I was planning a trip to NYC and I literally used TripAdvisor for like 5min before I fell in LOVE with it!!!! I will be using this app for EVERY trip I go on from now on!!!!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 4
This app is our most used travel app. Hotels, attractions, maps, etc. - everything I save when planning on line shows up and we're good to go.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-03 5
I use this app everywhere I go to find good restaurants. Never been disappointed. Always leads me to good food and good service.
Version 5.7 2011-06-26 4
Having Trip Advisor on my iPad has worked very well for me, better than on the iPhone. Well designed and easy to use. But does need an ability to email links
Version 5.7 2011-08-09 5
Just what I need to scan hotels with their reviews of my liking. Simple and user friendly.
Version 5.9 2011-11-03 5
It helps a lot when we get opinions from whom really knows and tried the place/ service
Version 5.4 2011-04-15 4
Only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is that I disagree with how it ranks some restaurants and hotels on rankings but the convenience, info and accessibility of the app are great... Love consumer driven reviews
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
Took this app on trip to Miami .  It gave me great ideas for restaurants,beaches,attractions.  Download this app!!!  Dont leave home without it!!!!!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-26 5
This was just what I needed when we were having trouble finding a good restaurant on my last vacation.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
This is a must have download. I got this app for my 4s and really like the ease of use and effective searches that this simple offers.
Version 5.92 2012-01-17 5
I love Trip Advisor. My husband & I travel quite a bit and trip advisor has delivered every time I've researched a destination, outing, and restaurant. I use TA all the time...
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 4
I use the full version on my laptop and although there is some "getting used to" for the app it is a valuable tool for travel. I especially found it handy for our road trip.
Version 6.6 2012-11-17 5
Love the fact that I can rate establishments immediately without waiting to get to a computer.
Version 5.0.1 2010-08-30 3
Interface is clunky. Streamline the search menus would be nice.

Bug: You can enter reviews but if you rotate to landscape or hit any button it drops your ratings and comments, I've had to re-enter a few times.
Version 6.1 2012-06-10 5
Well organized and seems to be the most comprehensive and accurate of all the review sites.
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 5
This is a great app for planning a trip. After reading a few reviews about a location, you are left with a real sense of what to expect.
Version 5.4 2011-08-23 5
Wouldn't book a hotel without checking tripadvisor first
Version 6.6 2013-02-18 5
A great app to use while traveling.  I found so many great places to stay, places to eat, and sites to see though this app.
Version 5.8 2011-08-17 5
It really helped me find some awesome restaurants, hotels and much more! I recommend this app to many vacation goers(:

I use this to plan all of my vacations now.  Highly recommend this to all iPad use.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
Of all the Internet sites Trip Advisor offers the ease of making adventures come true!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-27 5
Tripadvisor is the international standard, very helpful for planning and booking all things travel!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
Works fine, no complaints here
Version 5.5 2011-05-08 5
This app is a must have for anyone who travels - even occasionally. Also great for finding good restaurants and things to do.
Version 5.7 2011-07-05 5
Best ever application for travelers and those seeking for new interesting places around! I am using it all the time on the go and for planning purposes!
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
It's so easy to use it and you can definitely find what you are looking for where ever you trip will be.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
I normally write my reviews on my MacBook, but this app works great when I've got my iPad out. TripAdvisor is a great site.
Version 6.2 2012-06-14 5
This is a must have app for anyone looking for traveling info or planning a vacation. The forums are most helpful.
Version 6.6 2013-04-04 5
I use this many times a day while traveling. It shows me restaurants and hotels near me and let's me know what to expect. This app is a MUST.
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 1
Clicking the button to log in with Facebook opens the Facebook app which tells me I have already authorized tripadvisor. Clicking Okay reopens Tripadvisor which tells me it is unable to retrieve Facebook profile data. I have tried signing in and out of both apps, and closing both apps, but the bug persists.
Version 8.3 2014-01-04 5
I use this app for all my travel needs whether planning or out and about in a new town!
Version 5.6 2011-05-26 4
Excellent app to find dining, lodging and things to do when in a new city. Combines review with location and allows great crowd-sourced choices!
Version 5.6 2011-06-15 5
TripAdvisor has been my go-to site for years. Definitely the place to start planning any vacation!
Version 5.8 2011-11-18 5
You have taken us to local eateries and to hotels thousands of miles away. We appreciate you more than we can say!
Version 6.6 2013-01-12 5
This app helped me widen my view on different things around the city
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 5
Restaurant ratings are spot-on, hotel ratings very accurate....finding that I depend on TA more and more whenever I'm on the road. Solid app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-18 5
Easy to find places attractions hotels restaurants love it easy to review them too. Recommended
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-18 5
Love it.  Couldn't recommend it more highly.
Version 7.0.1 2014-03-16 2
This was the 2nd time I went to this Resturant this time the service was very poor the food came out cold and the waiter dropped the menus and never came back - there were 5 of us and they stuck us at a table for four and put a chair on the end. For a three$ this was a one. We will not go back
Version 5.7 2011-07-12 5
If I'm planning a trip anywhere I turn to trip advisor to help me find my hotel real people, real pictures, real reviews.
Version 5.7 2011-08-07 5
Very easy app to use on my iPhone. I was already using it on my computer.
Version 6.1 2012-06-04 5
Only missing a book from site option
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 4
The app works very well at home or on the road, anywhere with an Internet connection. IPad is my travel medium and this may be my most used app and easiest to use.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-14 5
This site saves you time, money, as well as undue punishment to your taste buds. Thanks to everyone who submits a review.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 4
I like this ap - earning badges is kinda fun. I did not give it 5 stars because it is somewhat clunky. I.E. It is not easy to search in an area different from your current location.
Version 5.8 2011-08-13 5
Get updated info on places and things to do. Quick, easy, reliable. Simply an awesome app.
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 5
The summaries and reviews give you great insight in what to be aware of when traveling to your destinations. Keep up the good work!
Version 5.92 2012-02-17 5
Love this program and website. One of my favorite tools when visiting new places.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
TripAdvisor is to Europe as Yelp is to the US. Downloaded this app when I was in Ireland and it helped tremendously. Suggested great places to eat and stellar B&Bs.
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 5
Really enjoying this app for my iPad. It has everything I need to plan my trip & reviews by people know!
Version 6.2 2012-07-03 5

Gives rates found on multiple travel sites. Can also search for things to do at locations. Love it!
Version 6.6 2013-01-17 4
Pretty good but glitches. Wanted to use flight filters, but it wasn't applying them. Had to start search over. Haven't used it much yet.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-21 3
Reviews are easy enough to write and see, but the interface lacks the clear ability to manage your own reviews and look back for a review that you wrote earlier for a revision.
Version 5.7 2011-07-26 5
I have used this app from Jackson Hole Wyoming to St. Petersburg Russia. Haven't been disappointed yet. It is a must take on all my trips.
Version 5.92 2012-02-05 5
Pretty much all you need to get the scoop on any travel destination. I have the app for both iPhone & iPad & they're both terrific.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-24 5
It's great to try recommendations by people who have been to the place before.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 4
Works good, but when you look at a hotel it sends you to the top of list when you go back. This makes you scroll down to where you left off.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-27 4
This app has been very helpful on my honeymoon search. It would be nice to be able to enlarge the photos though. Other than that, it's perfect.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-17 5
Trip advisor is always helpful when traveling.  I've found some great restaurants, and hostels with it.
Version 8.1 2013-11-10 3
We have depended on trip advisor for Europe and the US. On a recent trip to Japan we used the app but found the restaurants recommended were disappointing. Used concierge at trip advisor recommended hotels for better recommendations.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-10 4
Just started using APP and so far not to bad. I would like to see the APP include number of members in my party when searching for prices on hotels etc
Version 5.6 2011-05-26 5
This app takes a lot of the stress out of finding great places to eat and things to do when you only have one shot at getting it right.
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 4
My husband and I are going to New Zealand next year and this app has helped us figure out flights, things to do, etc.... Our trip will be a awesome because of Trip Advisor.

Planned my honeymoon to Kauai in no time. Great prices, advice, and options make me want to travel more often.

Why have several apps when this one will do every thing they will do? It reliable and accurate and it is free. I can't ask for more. No complaints, only praise.
Version 5.92 2012-01-24 5
I found this app to be extremely useful on my vacation; wish I would have found it sooner.
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
I love the reviews and user uploaded photos. Makes it easier to research, especially hotels!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 4
Had a very pleasant dinner. My salad and seared scallops were very good. We ended up chatting with the two couples one other side of us, so the conversation was great. The staff are knowledgable and pleasant.
Version 5.6 2011-06-15 5
This app is great. We used recently on a trip to GSMNP. It showed all the restaurants that were close and their ratings.  It helped us pick our dining choices. Love it.
Version 5.8 2011-09-24 4
I travel alot within Kenya & the app has been a great guide to help me choose an appropriate accommodation
Especially in a new town. Would most definitely recommend it. :-))
Version 6.6 2012-12-06 5
Trip Advisor did a great job with this app.  It is very thorough and useful.  If you travel at all, you must download this app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-25 4
Could use a few more filter options (a la the yelp app) , but overall great app and great site with many more, and more discerning, users as far as I can tell.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-16 5
If ur somewhere new, trip advisor. If ur somewhere old, trip advisor. This app got's ur back. Whatever u
Version 6.0 2012-03-25 4
It's a good app. Fully functional as much as the website. What happened to adding photos? Since the upgrade recently there is no option to upload visitor photos...

Love it, use it almost daily.

Version 5.6 2011-06-06 4
I wish I could login into my account to view my personal map. Also, it would be great if I could search attractions, hotels by people's ratings and by location (countries, states). Overall it's good.
Version 6.3 2012-07-20 5
Started using it right away, with reservations I made before, and found it  accurate and up-to-date.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-19 5
Knowing real people have written real reviews puts one at ease when plenty of $$ is at stake. Fantastic app.

My first place to check for reviews. So much more accurate than  company websites.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-14 4
I found Trip Advisor very useful and well designed, much better that other travel apps for domestic travel like Expedia for example.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
Before I go anywhere and when I am deciding where to go I always check with trip advisor first.  Great app!
Version 5.7 2011-07-27 5
It is very informative, it locates where you are with your IPAD and recommends restaurants, what you need.

Traveling in Europe and Turkey with my iPhone and this app is great.  All the features of the website without having to squint.
Version 6.1 2012-04-23 1
I used to love this app but now I don't even use it and that is saying a lot because I am traveling for one year and could really take advantage of it!  The problem is that it doesn't show all the lodging options anymore.  I now use the Internet when I want to use tripadvisor, which is annoying in its own right because it keeps asking me to download the app.  I have it and hate it!
Version 6.1 2012-05-23 5
I love using Trip Advisor's website, consulting it before every trip, and now I love their app!  Wonderful to have.
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 5

Version 5.8 2011-10-31 5
We travel pretty frequently, so we turn to trip advisor all the time. We get great reviews and recommendations!

I travel very often and find it very useful for everything, from finding good hotels, restaurants, things to do, etc...
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
I always use TripAdvisor when traveling to a new city.  Most of the reviews are accurate.
Version 6.4 2012-08-23 4
I like Trip Advisor. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there's not easy access to local numbers for the establishments. Other than that, it's a great app.
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 5
Should be called "personal compass." helped us on family vacations and on our current anniversary getaway.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
I use this app for planning & while on vacations.  It has become my go to source for information.

Trip advisor is the perfect app to find a restaurant, place to stay and even activity, no matter where you are.
Version 5.8 2011-10-17 4
The maps don't give any hint about their scale. I see my hotel and the surrounding restaurants but how far is it? 100 yards? 2 miles?
Version 6.1 2012-06-04 5
My go-to travel app. Just about anything I need information on is now at my fingertips.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 3
As for telling you about events and where they are it's great. But it lacks any details like when it is, the times places are open, or even general descriptions of the place. Overall not very helpful as I have to look elsewhere for info.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Seamless integration with e-mail and safari! Brings all of the great insight and info from trip advisor to your phone!
Version 6.6 2013-02-02 3
It's a nice app for hotels, but it doesn't include vacation rentals (apartments), which is the only way I prefer to vacation.  Their website does a nice job with vacation rentals on a PC, but is a bit quirky using an ipad (kicks you out a lot).
Version 5.8 2011-09-11 5
Every time I travel, I consult all my questions, usually already asked and answered by someone and have yet to be misled.
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 5
I've used this for many trips and it comes in very helpful and has taken me to some awesome places:)!

I love this app and so trust the reviews, feedback and input.  Please keep improving the features and expand into others areas.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 2
Content from users is what made me get this app. Very useful for trips. What is annoying is that after reading several reviews on the tripadvisor app, it kicks you back to the beginning of your initial search; so you have to input your information from scratch again & again & again...HIGHLY AGGRAVATING!!!!!
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-05 5
I depend on this Ap more than any other...I travel for work and I use it all the time.  It is always right on.
Version 5.9 2011-11-10 5
Used for all hotel reviews in Colombia, Thailand, Mexico, Costa Rica and all over USA.  Very easy to use and the best thing is the price!

Trip Advisor is a great place to start when planning a trip, to check out places to visit, stay, eat.

Version 5.92 2012-02-08 3
I love trip advisor online and was expecting the online version to interface with this app so that way I could see my saved trips, disappointed that it doesn't! Great app on the go though, will rate 5 stars if they link the programs
Version 6.5 2012-09-25 5
Love it, don't know how I did it without it. Due to my job I travel most of the time. A real resource for anyone who travels.
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 5
Use it for restaurants, hotels, and resorts. Love reading the reviews before making a decision. Found it to be reliable outside of the U.S.
Version 6.2 2012-07-10 5
No matter where you're traveling to, this app can help you get some ideas of where to go and what to do. Love it!!
Version 6.6 2013-03-12 3
When I edit a post it doesn't bring up the current post I am editing- it brings up a post I wrote a year ago.

I have to copy the current post, then delete the year old post, then past and edit the current post. 

It's a bug that needs to be fixed!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-16 5
Love the information and to read the reviews. Very helpful in deciding where I want to go and stay.

Always use trip advisor and you will always make a great choice!!
Version 5.3 2011-01-15 4
I bought the Trip Advisor app a long time ago, before they had an iPad version.  I deleted it...twas not very good.

Through a lucky iPad hiccup, ALL my apps were re-installed, and so I updated then.   WOW !

The new iPad TripAdvisor is excellent...VERY useful, even in my home territory.  It reminds me of the first time I came across TripAdvisor on the PC....it was a revelation re information for travelling.  The iPad app is just that good.  

Good work.
Version 5.4 2011-02-17 4
Could you add a bookmark function?

Can't plan a trip without consulting Trip Advisor first! All the customer reviews have never let me down!
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
I love TA ... I wish it had a filter for boutique hotels (like hotel Giraffe in NYC) but otherwise have found it to be a really accurate tool.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-14 5
Just started using this app and so far so good. It's a great help to instantly see reviews while traveling. Like!
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 3
It is difficult to find out what amenities the hotels have. Also the only filter for the search is by price. It would be nice if this app had filters that allowed you to narrow your search results by amenities, star level, etc.
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 4
The trip advisor is a great informal app. I had one issue however: you have you sign up to write a review. I already have an itunes account so this review was easily accessable to me.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 5
I find the app easier to navigate through than if I went directly to the website.

As a frequent business traveler, I always check tripadvisor before heading into a non none restaurant and find it to be spot on most of the time.
Version 5.5 2011-04-15 5
Found hotel in cabo via tripA.

Helped me find my past and next hotel. You can't go wrong if you follow it's advice.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 4

Everyone should have this app in his mobile as it's the people's experiences in traveling.

Could get the current version to work and had to delete it with all my settings. Reload seems to have fixed everything except having to redo all my settings. Working so far.
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 5
Excellent app. Able to check on prices, make reservations, and find places to eat. Would recommend to all
Version 6.1 2012-04-03 3
Overall this app is a winner, unfortunately there seems to be an issues with displaying links posted  in the TA forums...they get cut off and rant clickable. Big issue that severely reduces usability of the app for viewing forums.
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
always great to refer to before going on a trip... now i can do it while im ON the trip!!  super convenient!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-02 5

The app is wonderful in letting me identify options. However, it would help if the mobile app allowed writing reviews.
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 3
Okay aggregator of the website data. Opened the app to read the reviews of a hotel my wife booked. Can't stand the fact that the reviews are 1/5th the screen with a map of the place taking the rest of the real estate. Just doesn't make sense.
Version 6.1 2012-06-10 5
I love it when traveling to see places and restaurant reviews. I will often write a review as well so I don't forget.

A great reference tool but if there are insufficient reviews it's difficult to get an accurate rating. I've used Trip Advisor for some five years now and wholeheartedly recommend it.

I always check out places on trip advisor before booking anything!!

Very easy to use. We are planning a family vacation and it has helped us to plan many exciting things to do.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 2
The online version Is pretty good, but how does the app work?   Searched for lodging in Saba, nothing found.  Now looking for lodging in St Maarten, it shows me a world map when I select St Maarten.  Will keep trying and hope to have an epiphany of the  logic used to program this app.

I now use TA for everything they offer.  The continuing accrual of information is phenomenal.

You should download this app, especially for overseas travel.  Tripadvisor seems to be most handy when it comes to lodging reviews and ratings.

Very helpful for making major decisions about traveling

Version 6.1 2012-04-12 5
This app works well on my iPad; haven't figured out how to connect it to my FB account.
Version 6.6 2012-12-19 3
I used this app last summer and it was very helpful.  However I just attempted to find info about a hotel in Reykjavik, Iceland but the map did not appear with the hotel marker.  Totally useless without a map.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-07 4
Very convenient app for tourists. I use search and reviews for hotels, restaurants and attractions. It is great. Maybe need to add some GPS features: tracking,navigation so on.
Version 5.7 2011-06-29 5
We use Trip Advisor for all of our travel, domestic and foreign.  Very reliable! Use it to rate everything from restaurants to hotels.
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 5
Saves so much research time - whether pre-planning or "need to know now"...must have app.
Version 5.92 2012-01-31 5

Version 6.1 2012-05-04 5
Great app!  This is especially helpful for hotel managers looking to keep an eye on what guets are saying about their experiences!
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 4
Fun app!!  Kept our granddaughters, age 2 1/2 & 4 1/2 busy and entertained for hours.  Only wish I had two IPads so they wouldn't get impatient while they waited for their turn :-)
Version 6.2 2012-06-18 3
So every time I update the App, my saves disappear. I love that App feature but sooo frustrating. Also, why don't they have a saves feature on the website so I can see them online where I do my serious research and printing?
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 5
Found a great place to eat in Cave City, KY with Trip Advisor. It has been very helpful everywhere we travel.

I have used this app a lot and find it very useful for finding highly rated places to eat, visit and hotels.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-26 3
I love the Trip advisor web site, so it would be a given to download the app.  The fact that the default view is 2/3 of the screen being a map is annoying.  If there's a way to turn it off, I haven't been able to figure it out.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
I just down loaded it yesterday. But we r leaving soon on a trip &it has already been a big help to us. Thank's
Version 6.1 2012-04-05 2
Too slow of an app and forced an upgrade when we needed to use it. Upgrade should be optional when you have a computer connection for faster download. App works for it's purpose but not as useful as trip advisor on computer. Need to speed it up so we can find restaurants quicker. Like trip advisor but hate the app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
Great app that makes it easy to find information and easy to write reviews. I love it!
Version 6.5 2012-09-26 5

Very user friendly and love the fact that users can upload pics of hotel rooms and views etc
Version 6.6 2013-04-29 5
This is one of those apps that feels like a perfectly formatted version of the web page.  Thanks!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-20 5
I always download info on this app before I leave on a journey.
Version 5.9 2011-11-13 5
Great insights about places to go, especially restaurants that are really good, but not necessarily the most famous and expensive.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-02 4

Version 5.5 2011-04-26 2
I am uninstalling this app as soon as I finish this review. It has no opportunity to sign in as a trip advisor user. The content is very limited with no access to the destination guides. I don't understand the high ratings. It must be from non trip advisor members. Stick with the website. Developers please include all the features of the website.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
I could be in USA or small town in Dominican  Republic with trip advisor I can find a place to stay with the proper rate and directions etc...

Trip advisor has never steered me wrong. I rely on TA for restaurant and hotel suggestions all over the world. It's the best!
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 2
I'm a big fan of TA. I also like to see pictures of places before going there in addition to reading reviews.

Seems like TA is not really making a lot of efforts to clean up pictures before they're posted. Many are upside down or sideways.

Not good!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-19 5

Version 5.8 2011-09-25 1
I tried to enter my home but does not let me and it is not smart enough to find my location omits own. Then I went to find activities but that failed again since it has no idea where I am at. Then I went to the forum just to be presented with 3+ years old postings.
Will give it a try again when I feel like digging but my first attempt to make use of is app has failed 100%.

Version 8.3 2014-01-25 1
Warning !  When you get to westgate villas in Orlando they tell you for a one hour meeting you can have a pass to use the facility. Well it took all morning before they would "let us go!"  We told them from the beginning we would not be purchasing a timeshare.  This was so deceptive and frustrating to waste a half day on this. Don't get sucked in!
Version 6.1 2012-05-05 5
My wife and I use TA on our smart phones and the web-based version. Wouldn't leave home without it.

Version 6.3 2012-07-22 3
View is awesome as well as general service. If you like rare prime rib or steak don't order it here. Two weeks in a row it came out medium at best and the manager came out to argue that it was just the light not the fact that their cooks had no clue how to cook a steak.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-12 5
I use this & opentable to make sure I enjoy every where I go
Version 5.8 2011-09-18 5

Thanks for such a great app.
Version 6.0 2012-03-22 4
I use this all the time for research and. To write reviews but I can't find where I can see my account and things I have reviewed??  Maybe I am missing it.  Other than that I'm digging it!
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
Does what it intends - could be smoother transition when expanding reviews as you seem to loses your place momentarily.
Version 6.6 2013-03-29 4
Love this app!  Has helped us on every trip from things to do to hotels and places to eat.  Honest reviews of places makes this worth while.

I would like it if there were an option to list the restaurants in alphabetical order in the "sort by" drop down menu.
Version 5.8 2011-08-29 5
Love this app. It is very easy to use and provides tons of info. Maps, directions, suggestions, everything!

Version 7.0.1 2013-07-11 5
Gives more info than any web search, and handy at that!
Version 4.1 2010-03-31 2
I am a big fan of the Trip Advisor web site for hotels and resorts, but this is ridicuously outdated. It includes restaurants that have been closed for well over a year. I wrote a review that said "Closed" and they just ignored it. They need a button that you can press to tell them that a restaurant has been closed.
Version 5.5 2011-05-13 5
Love the features, I can plan my whole trip right in one place using reviews, air tool and restaurants! Nicely done.

This application is great because it gives u a lot of good information about restaurants and hotels.
Version 5.8 2011-10-29 5
I have been able to do all that I do on a pc on my iPad with this app. Works well, nicely organized and good photo resolution.
Version 5.6 2011-05-26 5
I primarily use it for restaurants while traveling and it has been perfect for that alone!
Version 5.9 2011-12-22 3
This app is way too simple theres features missing like how to view all my reviews amongst other options like seeing your photos being posted etc. Meh. The full website is better.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 4
I used this to help plan a recent vacation. The reviews from others have been detailed and informative. Great for quick use.
Version 8.1 2013-11-07 5
The new live map search feature is exactly what this app needed. The go-to app for traveling.
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 5
More information than 15 guidebooks combined...it's really helpful!
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5
This app was our bible for our first visit to Chicago. The things to do section was fun, helpful and accurate.
Version 5.8 2011-09-12 4
This is a good app, but could use some work. It does not list all of the restaurants in the area. I would like to add a few, but don't know how.
Version 5.8 2011-09-13 4
This app works for me especially when I'm on the road and need a quick reference.   I like how it rates everything so you can make pretty decent decisions.
Version 5.92 2012-02-12 5
How nice to read what other travelers think!   Trip advisor has helped us find good places.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 1
I gave up on this app a year ago. Decided to try it again, after seeing ratings go up.

Guess what? Still so-o-o much worse than web site:
- can't sign in with my Trip Advisor account - sign in field disappears once you start typing
- can't filter search results by price
- missing lots of hotels - right around me! - that are clearly shown on web site
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 5
Great app to know places to eat|stay|visit when traveling! A must have for traveling!

Version 6.2 2012-06-18 5
I see you have a Locals' Pick for Facebook. How about an iPad App like it so you could see a locals' comments.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-14 2
On the web version there is an one-way button, multi city button and round trip button for flights, but on the iPad version no multi city option for flights.... I downloaded the app to plan my next multi city vacation... I guess I will do that on the web at a different site.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5

Use it all the time while I'm away from home to find good places to eat!
Version 6.1 2012-06-04 4

Version 6.0 2012-03-30 5
Great handy app for planning trips and weekend getaways.. A must have for spontaneous trips as well!!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-22 2
I would write a review after spending more time with the app, but I have spent a frustrating 15 minutes attempting to find the Add to Trip/Save button. I finally took to the reviews here in the App Store to find out it's only available in portrait mode. that is ludicrous! hence, just 2 stars.
Version 5.8 2011-08-22 5
Awesome app! Very helpful when out of town for sights, dining, directions, etc! Thank you

I don't understand why this app keeps switching location on me when I scroll through the next set of search results.  Very annoying, but I do like that it gives me results.
Version 8.2 2013-12-13 5
Easier to navigate, more intuitive than your website.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-26 3
Overall, I like this app, but it is lacking one IMPORTANT feature: the ability to post and view pictures of places. My rating will jump up to 5 stars when you implement that feature!
Version 5.6 2011-05-30 4
Great app. It would be even better if you could select places to stay / see / eat and string up your selections into a travel plan complete with time frames.
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 5
Always our first choice when looking for dining choice, both at home and on the road.
Version 5.7 2011-08-01 5
Great for ideas & ref's on what to do in destinations, but the best thing is others people's input on these. Nothing like the word of experience!
Version 5.9 2011-11-30 5

Wished I knew about it earlier! Great app, has everything you need to plan and book any trip
Version 5.9 2011-12-25 2
It is not a 4star hotel, not more than 3 star, old building and room as well, breakfast is not that good. But position is ok, quiet in a small street, but still I've  booked it only for 50 euros,so what should I expect. You can go there if you are looking for good price but not the level of accomodation.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 4
I have been using TripAdvisor for several years for hotels. The past two years I starting using it for restaurants. No I can do all this on my phone with the App. Sweet!!

Just started using it and this app is all I need plus more to plan a quick getaway!!
Version 6.6 2012-12-30 1
This app is horrible. The ui needs to be redesigned from scratch. Even the most simple functions are hard to access. I just spent 20 minutes trying to pull up the list of attractions in Nanjing and the app gave me a couple of error messages and kept hiding every other destination every time you touch the map. Use the web site instead.
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 4
Search, reviews, maps, prices, etc.
Just wish the search filters were more comprehensive (filter by price, stars, etc)
Version 5.9 2011-11-16 5
Great app, easy to use, reviews from real people, that even post they're own photos from they're trip! just awesome.
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 5
I can't tell you how often I use this thing as the master vacation planner in our house!
Version 5.92 2012-01-20 4
like anything else, use your common sense. if all bad, probably good, if all good probably good. if in the middle, maybe someones expatiation's were too hugh or too low.

Version 7.1.1 2014-03-26 5
This is a great way to find out the best and worst about a restaurant, hotel, etc. I rely on it completely every time I travel.
Version 5.0.1 2010-09-27 2
The app closes/crashes anytime you lose internet connectivity and anytime you leave the app it will not remember where you left off so you always have to start on the main page. May as well use the mobile version of the website as it seems to function better
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 4
It is a great app.  The only complaint I have is many of the reviews are old and some of the attractions I was looking at are now closed.  It would be nice if they would update the attractions.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-29 5
I use this app quite often and always find it useful and user friendly.

Excellent tool and really easy to use.  The ratings are just a guide but point out places you wouldn't find with just a simple google search.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 4
This app is handy but when adding pics to a review be sure to check where they are being added. Sometimes a previous review reappears.
Version 6.6 2013-04-03 5

Awesome app, but dumb one. My city in Brazil, Praia Grande SC, does't have a rigth photo showing the beauties of the Canyons and we can't find a hotel on search, still having hotels in the city. The thing is, we are a small town here, but we live for turist, so I think that app have so much to improve it!

Version 5.8 2011-10-22 4

Version 5.7 2011-07-08 5
Great app !!! Totally recommend
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
Want to get away and travel?  This program really slows you what is what.  Very easy to navigate.  I am very happy it is on my IPad.
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 4
I enjoy scoping out hotels we are considering, and compare them to a lower and higher resort (like at WDW). You do need to put reviews into perspective though.
Version 5.8 2011-11-26 4
Helps to plan my trips. I've gone the reviews listed here once about a hotel I was thinking about staying at, wish I hadn't. Perfect app for the casual traveler or road dog...AND It's Free!
Version 5.92 2012-02-19 5
Love this app and contribute often. It's a crucial part of both personal and business travel for me, and I do a lot of both!
Version 6.6 2012-12-18 2
Just recently, the ability to Save or view My Saves has disappeared. I re downloaded the app for iPhone, the My Saves button is momentarily visible, but navigating away from main page causes the button and ability to disappear. Please fix.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-15 5
Love trip advisor and city guides.  I use it all of the time while doing research for restaurants, hotels, attractions.  Great app, great site
Version 8.5 2014-03-23 5
Prefect to find things near you or right before you go on a trip
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5

Kudos.  Five stars. Was able to suit motel review from my iPhone with not much trouble. Recommended. :-). Stephen
Version 8.3 2014-01-05 3
I liked this app a lot better last spring before all of the recent updates. Tried to save a place and was asked to login. Can't find a place to do so. Settings shows me as logged in already. Frustrating.
Version 5.6 2011-06-07 5
This is the single traveler app you must have, you won't need anything else!! Complete in every way.
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 4
My wife and I like to find local eateries and places off the tourists trail when we travel.  TripAdvisor recommendations and reviews have been invaluable.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5

Version 6.6 2012-11-09 5
Precise, accurate, efficient; allows me to make informed decisions and plans while on the go.
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 5
This is the perfect app for looking for a hotel for a reasonable price and a good rating. I would recommend it.
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 4
Works better on he iPad than the iPhone.  I wish there was an easier way to get to the playa del carmen forum. It's especially hard to navigate through all the menus on the phone.
Version 6.3 2012-08-11 3
The website is my go to for trip planning. The app is good for a quick look but lacks the full functioning of the website.  I am sure that it will continue to improve with updates.
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
I use this app whenever I plan my trips. It's been so helpful, I couldn't go without it. Thx TripAdvisor!
Version 5.8 2011-08-28 5
I have used trip advisor for every trip I go on. I haven't been disappointed.
Version 8.3 2013-12-25 4
Like being able to review and favorite locations to visit later. However runs phone VERY hot. Worried it will damage my phone. 5s.
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 5
The user reviews give an honest take on the places that aren't biased and help greatly when choosing a hotel, restaurant, etc
Version 5.9 2011-11-12 5
Maybe it's too early to tell, but I love this app.  Way easier and faster than the laptop.  Enough said!
Version 6.1 2012-05-04 5
Great for everything.  can plan your whole trip on one site and find out what ppl think.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
Lots of useful info with fairly accurate info. Must have app when traveling
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 3
Definitely needs a "back" button on the forum, otherwise I have to re-type my search words which is highly annoying. A few kinks to straighten out, then it will be five stars!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 5
I love this app!  We used this on vacation this year and it was a great way to find nice hotel rooms.  It also reviews restaurants.
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 4
This app is just as handy as a shirt pocket.  It makes traveling so much more enjoyable and less stressful.  I probably should give it a 5 star rating but I haven't given anything 5 stars.
Version 8.3 2013-12-24 5
I have used this on three trips so far and it hasn't failed me yet. Great for finding quality in a strange place.

Version 5.9 2011-12-04 5
whenever I travel to a new location I use this app for hotels and places to visit, very informative.
Version 5.9 2011-12-24 5
Social media at its best. It's only as good as the input from contributors and, thankfully, there many of us.
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 5
If you're traveling, especially for leisure, there is no better resource for reviews and info on hotels, restaurants, etc.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
easy to use, clean ui, and no crashes as of using for a week. cant ask for much more. great work
Version 8.2 2013-12-01 4
The app is great for me because I'm always on the road. Easy to use, but I wish you could sort hotels by distance from a location/address.
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
Love this app!! I can review on my phone when I don't have access to my laptop!!
Version 5.6 2011-08-07 5

I love the "what's near me feature". Just took a pix of my desert and wrote my review while still at the restaurant. Cool.
Version 8.1 2013-11-13 4
Great app, but I can not report when a restaurant has wrong info, a wrong pic or wrong map address. Please bring that back.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Works just as well as the website. Great way to research vacation spots and restaurants right on my iPhone 4.

Version 5.7 2011-07-16 4
I travel globally each month, often to new locations and this app helps to make each trip less stressful.
Version 6.0 2012-03-23 5
If you know how to use it, skip the owner/employee comments (3-4 comments) you will find some great places!!!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-04 5
This app helped me plan the BEST trip well im still planing it but im almost done planning i just have to decide to go to San Juan or Calgary or Kauai LOVE IT

Version 6.6 2013-04-29 5
Wonderful for everything to do when you travel.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-17 5
Easy to use, easy to find the information I want. Very happy using this app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 2
I really like the trip advisor site. This iPad app just sits there and thinks a lot. Very disconcerting on a 4th gen device. Push the button on the reviews and it is taking a coffee break. 

I closed other apps thinking it was my system but even when operating alone it is pathetic.
Version 8.3 2013-12-29 5
We travel once or twice a year and I feel like most of the reviews are dead on!  like having a good friend to turn to.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 4
Great to use to find a room or restaurant while traveling in Europe! Thanks! The reviews help narrow down the search tremendously!
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 5
I absolutely LOVE this app!!!  In my mind your goal is for the app to work as good as the online version and this one does. Not a single complaint!
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
A good way too check out things before u get there and we can make it better by updating
Version 8.1 2013-11-11 4
I'm a student and I'm on a tight budget when I travel..this is a great app for students who don't wanna spend too much but still have a great time!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
I can easily write reviews, upload pictures, and search for restaurants.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
I have been using Trip Advisor for for two years now and never been mislead. Now that I have an IPad I am glad there is a T.A. App?
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
I use this exclusively for restaurants and places to stay. I've never been led astray. Thanks for making my vacas the best.
Version 6.4 2012-08-24 3
Search function could be better, for example RDU brings up only 2 hotels, you have to remember that it's in Raleigh/Morrisville. A "redo search here", like Yelp uses, would be a real benefit.
Version 6.6 2013-04-14 5
Always my first stop in shopping for flights and hotels.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
Awesome app!!! it's completely what me and my boyfriend needed to help us plan out weekend excursion!! :-)

Trip Advisor was beyond helpful while planning my recent trip to England. Info on places to go, stay, do was awesome. I love Trip Advisor!
Version 6.2 2012-06-16 4
Something very meta about writing a review of a reviewing tool. Anyway the trip adviser ipad app is easy to use and quite clear. Even better than the web app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-09 5
Nice app. Simplifies some things that are difficult on the website.  Nice near me now feature.
Version 6.6 2013-02-10 5

Definitely worth downloading. Would be great if you could aggregate prices as well without users having to launch so many windows
Version 5.8 2011-08-19 5
Very useful while traveling. They really should have an option to add a restaurant if it isn't in there system.
Version 5.9 2011-11-09 5
Really great app for checking areas you are unfamiliar with... Hotels, food, ect...
Version 5.9 2011-12-04 5
I use and trust tripadvisor. Once I am at my destination, I travel often, I use mainly for entertainment and food.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
I used this app regularly as a frequent traveller. While using it in Istanbul, I was forced to "upgrade" to the new mapping function provided by Bing. To say that this is the worst upgrade ever would be an understatement. I went from being able to deftly navigate around a new exciting city in the morning to being completely lost by the afternoon. DO NOT UPGRADE!!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-31 5
I don't write many reviews, but this app was so helpful during our road trip across the U.S.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
Never do anything or travel without checking tripadvisor first!
Version 6.6 2013-01-05 5
Found tripadvisor when planning a trip with my boo and it helped us a great deal. Good job guys. Thumbs up.

We downloaded this app on a whim when we couldn't decide on dinner our first night in NYC. Great recommendations led us to a delicious deli just down the street!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-26 5
I use trip advisor all the time for accurate and detailed information on hotels and restaurants.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-11 5
The app crashes sometime on my pad (gen 2) but I love the app.  I use it all the time and will start to write more reviews.
Version 8.4 2014-02-02 5
Makes traveling a breeze! A must 21st century travelers! What did people so before Trip Advisor??

You guys get it. Great software. It's all about a great service and powerful software and tripadvisor gets it

This app works pretty well, when getting directions it jumps to google like map but doesn't keep your,current location. Though it was user error but it did it more then once

Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
Have enjoyed using while traveling along the east coast. Highly recommend the download.
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 5
Sometimes I must visit the full site for full functionality. I review as well as read reviews.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 3
Just started using the app on iPad and seems limited when accessing account information. I'm sure it will improve. Looks great just not completely functional.
Version 6.6 2013-04-08 4
Amazing app just need to please add ability to select what amenities u want for the hotel. Search ( I.E. hot tub , pool, smoking , gym , etc .. )
Version 5.5 2011-05-07 5
I love their website & app is great too. Wish I could save restaurants/places in a favorites list for easy access in the future.

Not only for travel but to explore new places right around you

Version 5.8 2011-10-25 5
I review in TripAdvisor often, and the TripAdvisor app is really helpful. Not quite the same as on a PC but very well done!

I'm having soo much fun organizing my next trip with this app. it's truly great! Definitely worth getting!
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5

Version 5.6 2011-05-30 4
This is a great app for quick info on a large variety of destinations. Some of the descriptions need to be expanded.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 4
Great app and easy to use.  All the same great information available on the website through a well designed and easy to use app for the iPad.
Version 5.8 2011-10-10 5
This app is so helpful and easy to use! Helped me plan my trip with reviews and suggestions of other travelers.
Version 6.6 2013-02-28 3
The map feature keeps blanking out, showing nothing but orange dots. It would be more useful if a set of selected hotels could be mapped out together, to see where they are in relation to one another.
Version 5.9 2012-01-09 5
Best of all the travel apps.  Essential if you're booking a hotel in a city you've never visited before.

I do love trip advisor but why, when you find a listing you like, and you tap "email", why does the email auto load the business name? Where is share?
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 5
This app is very helpful for trip planning or simply exploring.

This is a very comprehensive and easy to use tool.  I highly recommend it - one of the best out there.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 3
5 minutes in to using the app and nav is a bit cludgy...need to use the "back" button to get out of restaurants and search new towns.  Not as easy as I'd like.

Upside is that it's TA...great data, and the mapping is solid.

Can't wait for the first upgrade!
Version 5.8 2011-10-19 3
I have used a few times and up to now it works good. Though sometimes it doesn't provide the web sites for all hotels. I will try to use it more and probably next time I will have a rounder observation to make.
Version 6.2 2012-07-12 5
It's great I go to this app before I book 
Anything for the most part everything I

I am always researching my next trip.  Now I can do it on the run when I have time to spare!
Version 6.6 2012-11-11 5
The best place to get fares, rates, deals, reviews and information on flights and hotels.

This easy to use app is handy for getting the scoop on your travel destinations.
Version 5.9 2012-01-06 5
I look up restaurants and hotels always read customer reviews always find great places!!!
Version 5.92 2012-01-27 5
Have used for restaurants. Checking against restaurants I know well, the ratings make sense.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Thanks for Apple suggesting this app!  It inspires me to take more trips to places I might not have considered before,
Version 6.1 2012-05-25 5

Perfect for finding something to do on a lazy Sunday with the family or find new restaurants to try.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-22 5
Trip advisor is my number one go to app when planning a trip either out of town or a night out on the town!
Version 8.2 2013-12-09 5
I really enjoy this app! User friendly, easy to navigate through and no hang ups!
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
Beautiful app , that help you to choose based in your preference ...a lot of details...I really like it....
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
The reviews are extremely helpful. The maps, the fact that it shows places nearby, the % of thumbs up - everything is great. Love it!!!
Version 5.6 2011-07-22 5
Offers a lot of info in one spot.  Used it all the time on my computer.  Glad to have it in a portable version.
Version 5.8 2011-09-16 5
I've had the app installed for quite sometime. Today, I used it for the first time. Helped with all my needs.
Version 5.9 2011-12-04 5
This will be a great app to use on our trip to Charleston SC for Christmas this year. Very informative and great features.
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 3
This is just fine for travel research but I would like to see more member features.  There's no place to see reviews that you've done or check feedback.
Version 8.3 2013-12-31 5
A very efficient and convenient app.
Version 5.7 2011-07-03 5
I refer to this app at least once a week. Great info & I do read all the reviews before making final decisions on a hotel.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-06 5
Love to have reviews to help me choose and love the app design and functionality
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-16 5
This is my go to for travel planning and finding great places when on the road.
Version 6.3 2012-08-02 5
I've used this on a few trips now and it's really helpful when in a new locale.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-01 5
I'm a new traveler, just received my passport. This app is very good in helping to plan an international trip.
Version 8.3 2013-12-19 1
Ever since the latest update it hasn't worked the same, especially for flight info. I used to be able to find a flight with different airlines very easy and now the only airline it gives me is American. I even tried to filter and add the airlines but it doesn't even pull them up. I've deleted this since it doesn't fulfill my needs any longer.
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 5
Check rating of restaurants and lodgings here before every trip is a must-do.
Version 5.6 2011-06-01 5
Find anything from tourist spots to places where only the locals know about.
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 4
it's a great tool for finding a hotel that fits one's budget and travel plan. It'd be better if it allowed users to tag or bookmark a hotel or places in every stage of seach.
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 3
It's okay, but inconsistent.  Sometimes it works well and other times, not so much.  I don't like that you have to view landscape and it is difficult/ finicky when you actually try to book a hotel...  Improvements needed!!
Version 6.6 2013-02-11 5
A very good and must check app before planning each trip.
Version 6.6 2013-04-10 5
It is nice to use trip advisor, you really get good ideas from the places you visit, I definitely recomend it.
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 5
If you need a place to eat, stay, or something to do in a town your not familiar with this is a good app to use :-)
Version 5.9 2011-12-31 5
Very nice application. Really love ability to see what's around your current location on map!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Planned a spur of the moment weekend in the car and kept using it all weekend to plan meals and stuff to do.

Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5
I love trip advisor! The one time I didn't use trip advisor, my vacation turned out to be a disaster! Don't leave home without it!
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 5
Just what you would get on the website, even easier to navigate! Very impressed!
Version 6.1 2012-07-24 4
Do not go on a trip without first using TripAdvisor. Outstanding App gives you many great ideas and has lots of very good reviews to help plan a great trip!
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 5
Thanks for a great app! I've been using Trip Advisor for years and this adds more functionality.  Thanks again
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 1
This used to be a good app, and still is in many ways. However, when traveling it seems to detect that you're moving and automatically goes into the "what's around you" mode.  Guess their programmers never considered that I might want to be looking at what's available at my destination, which is currently about two hours away...  Thanks guys!
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
I never book any hotel without checking it in tripadvisor
Version 6.3 2012-07-19 5
Booked 2 bed and breakfasts in Ireland on a whim in 2 cities in 10 minutes. Reviews were spot on.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 4
I love trip advisor and used it a lot on my last vacation. The mobile app works fine, but seems way to limited.
Version 6.6 2013-01-04 5
I can't tell you how many times this app has saved me from boredom. I love it
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-11 5
Tripadvisor always very helpful and the app just takes it to the next level.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
I tried it in Thailand and Italy and it was great specially the maps
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
I tried it in Thailand and Italy and it was great specially the maps
Version 5.9 2012-01-07 5
I love this app! We use it any time we travel to find the most popular things to do, where to eat, where to stay, etc...
Version 5.92 2012-02-15 4
Gives me great reviews of restaurants & hotels. I have used Trip advisor Website for my trips for at least 4 years. It is always very accurate. Thanks to the contributions of the reviewers.
Version 6.1 2012-04-30 5
I use it all the time but would like to see my own account info somewhere...
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-06 4
I have no issues with app, and the places I went to honor the price. Actually used as far as Korea, and still worked out fine.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Great app! We have used this app on the iPhone and iPad to make our summer vacation plans..... Love it!!!!!!
Version 5.4 2011-06-26 4
Great application but need to have log in option say like from FB
Version 5.7 2011-08-03 4
Great little app, very useful in finding hotels around your destination. It may be a little buggy and the UI could use a more fluent and faster one, overall geat app!
Version 5.7 2011-08-10 5
It give prior expend your money the opportunity to see the experience of others and if it will be worthy or not.
Version 5.3 2011-08-10 5

Version 5.9 2011-12-15 5
Love having reviews of a place as we travel so we can decide where to go . Thank you
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 5
Just bought an iPad and this app is by far my favorite. Very easy to use...easier than the normal website!
Version 6.1 2012-06-10 2
When I got this app it the working experience was good. It was easy enough to get around and explore. I didn't need to say anything about it. But now with this Bing Map, the experience is disappointing. This new arrangement and the data is not well integrated for a good user experience.
Version 6.6 2013-04-26 5
I love this app. It offers everything from the website all in the palm of my hand.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-15 5
Great for reviewing a place before you go so you know what you are getting into.
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
Never steered me wrong and now I'm known as the expert on where to stay and eat!
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 2
App has this ridiculous requirement that reviews have to be 200 characters at least. Fine, but it keeps saying I haven't written enough, when it's clear I've written more than 400 characters!  So it's useless to try to write a review with this app. I wonder what else might be malfunctioning.
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 4

Version 5.8 2011-10-16 5
I travel internationally often and tripadvisor often has the best prices and it's easy to use.
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 5
All kind of information for places in the world, we use it every time we want to travel....
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-28 5
I think this app is fine.  I've not had any problems using it.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-12 5
I use it for everything, from traveling to just picking a place to eat
Version 5.0.1 2010-07-18 3
Nice and really helpful app but no photos of hotels posted by users. That's a very nice feature of the web version and would like to see it here. Photos posted by users are really helpful since they show how the hotels really look like. Thanks!
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 4
Really enjoy all the features of this app.  Very informative, good reviews, maps, etc. easy to navigate. No complaints thus far.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
I use it a lot to plan my trips an the accuracy of he information is near to 100%.....highly recommend
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
I travel locally and on the road with this! Never leave home without it. The reviewers are on target 99.9% of the time.
Version 5.5 2011-05-11 4
I use this all the time when I am pondering about a place I have never stayed and want to see what other travelers think. Great tool to help travellers- def a handy dandy helper for me!
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 4
Seems like a good app but I wish I could log in to leave reviews from my TA user account like I can when on a computer
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-07 5
I always use trip advisor for resturants and even airline tickets.  Gotta try it and You will like it.
Version 5.9 2011-11-01 4
Needs more requirements to evaluate with quality, speed, cost, safety, service being added or incorporated.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
I use this much more than I used the website because its fast and works well
Version 5.92 2012-01-31 5
I never book a hotel or excursion without checking here first. You get honest reviews .
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 5
Great app. I love looking at restaurants in the cities I am traveling to. It's a great way to take a look at what the city has to offer.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
Tremendously helpful in planning a
trip to many interesting parts of the world!
Version 5.9 2011-11-16 5
If you want to find anything locally or while on a trip and get real people ratings this is the app for you
Version 6.1 2012-05-21 5
App is easy and quick.  Love for research before a trip and help while traveling.
Version 6.6 2012-11-04 5
Works great! Same exact tripadvisor you find on the web :)
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 5
Great for getting a more personal feel for hotels and restaurant dinning.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-15 5
I would not travel without checking hotel and activity ratings on Trip Advisor first.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 5
Just what the world traveler needs to keep businesses honest and thriving! Go humans, go.
Version 5.5 2011-05-08 5
Love this app. Finding so many fun things to do and see right from my phone. Who knew it could be so easy?
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Great app for planning a trip & for finding out what to do, where to eat, etc while you're away. Love it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
The website is incredibly useful but the iPad app is indispensable.  Easy to use, easy to get used to!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 2
The regular www address is much better, much more functional.  I can't even access my own account on the app.  I wrote a review of a hotel--a long, comprehensive one--and when I submitted it, it just vanished after asking me to sign in.  I deleted this app.  I still like Trip Adviser, but not this app.
Version 6.1 2012-09-19 5
The surest way to find a good bite any time anywhere without falling into tourist traps!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-22 5
Really helpful app when your unfamiliar with a place. Makes you feel right at home!
Version 8.2 2013-12-14 5
It helps me decide where to eat , where to stay and what to do when we are out of town. I have become to rely on it.
Version 5.6 2011-06-26 5
Easy to use, intuitive, which is important for neophyte like myself.
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5
The only thing I would like to have on the app is a link to all my reviews.
Version 6.1 2012-05-23 5
Easy to navigate and gives me everything I love about Tripadvisor on the web.
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 5
Excellent app. Much more accurate than the Internet motel booking sites!
Version 6.5 2012-09-20 5
This app is a huge help in planning big trips and spontaneous adventures alike. A must have for any traveler.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-09 5

Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
Just excellent.   Everything you need when traveling

Love this application! Perfect for those of us who have no instinct for fun or an internal compass! Thank you for showing me the way!!!!
Version 5.8 2011-09-26 5
I am always using trip advisor. This app makes it very easy and quick to do the research you need.
Version 5.9 2011-12-17 5
Love the fact that there are so many local restaurant reviews for Israel, and they are pretty accurate (to my taste of course)!
Version 6.1 2012-04-23 4
I just downloaded it. Well I like it and see useful informations about the restaurants. That may make choosing restaurant to eat easy specially when u not in ur country
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-15 5
I've used this app on every city I came too and it made being a tourist so much easier
Version 8.2 2013-12-04 5
Does exactly what you'd want it to do. Great in helping me find restaurants. Definitely useful.
Version 8.2 2013-12-13 5
Trip Advisor is quite possibly the most helpful app in on the planet today. It is amazing! I stay on it all time!
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
As an Air Force sergeant, I have spent the last six years in Asia. This app is amazing for finding everything. It hasn't let me down yet.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 5
It's a great resource and easy to use. 
One of my favorite features is to see traveler's photos to get a real feel of a location.
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 4
Only drawback is the interface could use some work on hotel comp display.
Version 6.1 2012-09-18 4
Very helpful in providing guidance on recent trip to Spain.  Wish some of the top rated attractions had more descriptions or "guidebook" narrative.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
I use this and yelp when I go to places That is new, so helpful in many ways more than one.
Version 8.1.1 2014-02-16 5
We use it all the time, even in places we know just to jog our memory.
Version 8.5 2014-02-26 1
I'm really disappointed in this app. Where do you change regional settings (example Fahrenheit to Celsius?) Or more importantly update your profile? 

Even logging in was hard as the background image refresh kept hiding the login screen.

This app really does not warrant space on my iPad. 

Delete immediately
Version 5.9 2011-11-25 5
We made a spur of the moment trip to Florida from Michigan and this app helped us the whole way!
Version 6.1 2012-04-18 1
I'm a frequent traveler, and I love Trip Advisor online, but the app is crap. I cannot figure out why when I search for places in the app, it doesn't offer all the listings on the web site (for example, when searching for restaurants in Siem Reap, the listings start with number nine .  . . OK, what are 1-8?). Do yourself a favor and just use the web site through Safari.
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 5
Great for discovering things with no need to plan very far ahead!
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
The best app to avoid having a bad travel experience. The real photos are very helpfull !
Version 8.4 2014-02-04 5
Love it! I get so much useful info from it and it has never swayed me the wrong way
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 5
Could use a few experience upgrades but well worth while.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
Great for planning a trip, and maybe even better during one.
Version 8.3 2013-12-26 4
Well organized but should save previous searches.
Version 5.8 2011-08-20 5
Quick and easy reference on the go. Pretty accurate with rates and availability. Worth downloading.
Version 5.91 2012-01-20 5
If you travel and are looking for p2p info on places your unfamiliar with get this app
Version 5.92 2012-02-11 5
I travel often and this has the best info if one wants to get info from real travelers on lodging,food ect.
Version 5.6 2011-06-03 5
I have used this app locally and internationally and it is simply a great and accurate source of information.
Version 5.7 2011-07-30 1
This was the worst information I have seen in a travel program.  The restaurants list had sites that have been out of business for years did not have restaurants in the immediate area.  Then I checked the hotels I am sitting within in 5 miles of the Norfolk airport and  it only  listed one hotel a Travelers that was not even close and I would not stay in. Update your data!!!!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-25 5
Love this app. I find great restaurants and things to do in cities throughout the world.
Version 8.3 2013-12-26 5
This app is great to find the best hotels. For restaurants and best attractions, not so much. I guess it's because attractions & restaurants depend on taste.
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 5
I use TripAdvisor heavily when planning road trips. Never eat at a crappy restaurant again!
Version 5.8 2011-10-18 5
So far it has been fast, informative, and stable.  I definitely recommend this one.
Version 5.8 2011-10-27 5
Really am amazed to have discovered this app right before a big trip.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
Very helpful when going to new places
Version 5.9 2012-01-22 5
Can always depend on Tripadvisor for great info.  Love being able to use it on my phone!
Version 6.0 2012-03-26 5
I really trust the reviews of normal, everyday people. Trip Advisor is helpful in that way as well as the "things to do" lists they offer.
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
We used this app to find places on the fly while backpacking in Europe. Great app :)
Version 6.2 2012-06-12 5
Great for travel and backyard reviews too! Always look at Tripadvisor prior to vacation or simply local dining.
Version 6.3 2012-08-09 5
I love that I can have dinner (or hotel, etc.) and snap a few photo's and post them in a minute! Very easy to use!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-31 5
There is something new to explore with TripAdvisor App every tie you open it!
Version 8.0 2013-10-09 1
This was a great app before the last update. You use to be able to look at the map and the different motels would pop up at various exits. You could then plot your trip. Now you have to enter a city and you tied to that point. You can not follow your route to see what is further down the road without having to enter a destination.
Version 6.0 2012-03-20 4
Worked great for my Maui trip I use this app every day to check reviews and the travel forums for helpful hints not in the guide books
Version 6.1 2012-08-13 5
Love trip advisor!! I never leave home without it and never disappointed by its recommendations
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Because you have so many evaluators you get a fair and unbiased evaluation
Version 6.4 2012-11-24 5
I like reviwing this way...if i wait until i get to a computer i may forget.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-21 5
I don't go anywhere without checking my Tripadvisor app first.
Version 2.0 2011-08-13 4
Besides Yelp my favorite app to find a great restaurant. Would give it a five star rating if I could also search for pubs or bars
Version 6.1 2012-06-19 2
I wish the app had alternative forms of accommodations.  I was unable to look up B&Bs, vacation Rentals, or specialty lodging.  I could view theses on the website using Safari.  This leads me to believe they aren't getting all the other restaurant listings either.
Version 6.6 2012-11-17 5
you cant believe how happy i am when i find this
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 4
It's great to have a travel guide for anywhere in the world in your hip pocket at anytime. 

Restaurants generally very accurate. It's been a big help
Version 5.9 2011-11-05 5

Great app. Reviews very helpful. Thx Trip advisor. Will use always when planning another vacation.
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 5
I'm in Scotland from the states and Travel Advisor has more reviews of restaurants than any other app.  Excellent.
Version 6.4 2012-08-18 4
I had no idea this existed till I was stuck in some major traffic & someone in the car told me about this app Now I'm addicted to it...I totally recommend this app
Version 5.93 2012-03-08 5
I love being able to see pictures of the hotels and resorts from earlier travelers from their own perspective.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 5
This app has been incredibly useful on the recent trips I've taken. Ratings are spot on and its simple to use. Love it!
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 5
This app is working very nicely! Kudos to the developers. Def recommend this app!
Version 6.6 2013-02-18 5
One of the handiest apps I have ever used. Indispensable when traveling.
Version 6.6 2013-04-03 5
My favorite app to find the best hotels and restaurants all over the world.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-29 5

Used it in Mexico, Italy, France, and UK. Of course all over the US. Works great every time. Love it!
Version 5.9 2011-12-18 5
I like this app a lot. Features like things to do, restaurants nearby to hotels are very nice. A very neat well designed app.
Version 5.93 2012-03-08 5
I travel over half of the year. TripAdvisor gives me the buzz on what to eat, where to stay and where the fun is.
Version 6.1 2012-06-26 5
Super helpful for our trip to FL. Would like the hotel part to list if there is a restaurant in walking distance.
Version 6.4 2012-08-07 5
App comes in handy since we enjoy taking frequent mini vacations.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 4
Be careful and take advice with a grain of salt. People will report negative before positive, but I find it an excellent help when I'm somewhere new
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-24 3

Version 8.1 2013-11-10 1
Used to be a good application with ability to search cities you haven't yet reached and filter by rating as well as proximity; however those features have been replaced with functionality focused on marketing hotels.

Don't use this application; purchase a good guidebook instead.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-24 4
It's a solid app, but I wish I could also access vacation home rentals from the app.
Version 8.5 2014-02-24 5
I've been using this app for a while now. Love it. I've never had any problems.
Version 5.6 2011-05-18 5
Great app. Love the reviews of the hotels and restaurants. Helps to know what others think of a place you have never been. The maps are awesome.
Version 5.6 2011-06-13 5
Use this for every trip. Generally accurate ratings and reviews. Use regular site and iPhone app.
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
Its easy to travel with this app to any part of the world without knowing were i am in any part of the world.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Love it! Very helpful when making travel plans.
Version 5.6 2011-07-25 5
We visited Williamsburg, Washington dc, and Sarasota this summer, and this application provided us with things we want to do.  Great app.
Version 5.93 2012-03-03 5
Job well done, even let's you know everything around you where you going to be staying at
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 3
Previous versions of the app performed much better, after forced update to the new version it is slow. Content is still great, an search works well.
Version 5.7 2011-08-08 5
Great tool for vacations to find local things to do. So far has been pretty accurate for ratings of restaurants and sightseeing!
Version 5.8 2011-09-02 5
I love this app.  Very user friendly and you have access to a lot of info.  I highly recommended.
Version 5.8 2011-09-24 4
I use it regularly. I've found the reviews to be highly detailed and honest. I don't make a room reservation without checking withTripAdvisor first.
Version 5.9 2012-01-07 5
I use this app for everything when it comes to planning a vacation! Such helpful reviews.
Version 5.92 2012-01-18 5
I use it to check the ratings on the hotel I am currently working at. And some that I would like to work at!
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
Found lots of great cheap restaurants when I was planning a trip to a friend's house I highly recommend it!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 4
I think it has a lot of potential. However, I was looking for a Casino & Golf resort in Mayetta, KS and I had to give you all the info!  Now it's there.  Good job on everything else.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 4
Every review must be verified through the property in one way or another. These are real reviews by real people who have experienced the service.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-27 1
At least old app version had a distance filter, even if it was not user friendly/intuitive. Hopefully you have a quick upgrade in the works... And make sure you have actual users test it for intuitiveness. Not just your own people who already know the software and won't be able to spot problems as easily.
Version 8.1 2013-11-07 1

Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 4
I use this app more than any other.  It is such a help to read real reviews of hotels and eating establishments especially when in a new area.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
The presentation of info is easy and quick to use.  I especially like the ease of navigating within a map.
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
User friendly and usually right about the places.
Version 5.6 2011-05-25 5
Good reference source for hotels and sightseeing opportunities, restaurants.  It's got my vote of approval!
Version 5.7 2011-07-06 5
Takes all the guesswork out of planning a trip.  Haven't used a travel agent once since I downloaded this app.
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 5
Perfect way to plan every trip
Version 5.91 2012-01-14 5
Very intuitive and thorough.  Street view integration is very valuable.
Version 6.2 2012-06-17 5
TripAdviser is very usefull for who wants to travel and need honesty information.
Version 5.6 2011-05-19 5
Great resource when you want it anywhere you want info!  Very useful and easy to use.
Version 5.8 2011-10-05 5
Used for restaurants, hotel, and things to do reviews. Best site for traveling needs....hands down!
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 3
Overall I enjoy using this app. Most annoying feature is that the Cancel button is right next to the search field, and I accidentally tap that about half the time and cancel my searches. Ugh.
Version 6.6 2013-01-18 5
First time user and I find this program very helpful! Totally recommend *
Version 6.6 2013-03-26 5
Love using this to look up what to do/eat etc when visiting other places
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 5
It helped me all the way from coast to coast and around the globe! Thank you team, keep up the good work!
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5
Excellent app, generally agree with most folks.  Easy way to find the best of the best!
Version 6.1 2012-09-02 5
This site is much more cheaper than 
travelocity and priceline. 
I find this easier to use.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-25 5
Has traditional pub, fine dining and a deck overlooking Tralee Bay. Food the best on Dingle peninsula . A very good experience
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-02 5
Nothing to say other than it works great!  Really fast for looking up things on the go on vacation.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-29 5
Excellent app,
iPad version pictures are a problem though to
View
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 4
Great free app. Easier than using the website. Great use of location to show you what's close by. Highly recommended.
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 5
Whether for work or leisure, travel advisor is the "must-have-app" to learn the in's and out's of any area.
Version 5.9 2011-12-25 3
The app works, but it's buggy (I got green screen with nothing on it a few times), displays flight prices in British pounds (even though I have United States set as my location) and, above all, I find the style to be lacklustre.
Version 6.1 2012-04-22 5
I looked up a place where I had been and all the information was fair and correct.
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 5
Using app for the first time.  Ratings are dead on so far and very helpful for researching travel plans.
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 3
Great App and really helps find activities, hotels, etc.  It needs a companion App or feature for taking the saved places and creating an itinerary that can be used w/o Internet connection while on the trip.
Version 6.6 2013-02-02 5
We had a wonderful lunch at a lil spot, that we would never have found without Tripadvisor!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 3
It is that you cannot sort the reviews by the type of reviewer. I am more prone to listen to a top contributor than to the odd reviewer that has written 1 review and is probably linked to the establishment he reviewed
Version 5.8 2011-09-04 5
We are going out west and I am finding this App to be one of if not the most helpful Apps on my IPhone . Thank You
Version 5.8 2011-10-26 5
Well done app.   Uses the website well and makes it very easy to figure stuff out.
Version 5.9 2012-01-09 5
Love this app.  Do wish that I had a way to check other locations nearby where we want to vacation but this app works awesome.
Version 6.0 2012-04-23 5
Great source of info, always check on Tripadvisor when planning a trip !!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-30 5
It takes a lot of unknown out of locations never before visited.
Version 6.5 2012-09-16 5
What can I say but Hooray!  Put effort into the site because I've always been happy with what I've read.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-02 5
Useful information.  Beats finding hotels and restaurants on my own...
Version 3.0 2011-08-09 4
Love the app!  The forums have been immensely helpful to me.  I do hope that the next update will include a "favorites" section to make it simpler to return to specific forums.
Version 6.2 2012-07-02 5
I absolutely love this app!! Everything you need to plan a trip or vacation. 2 thumbs up.
Version 6.6 2013-01-24 5
This app is just as good as the website and comes in very handy in app form for your phone
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 5
Much needed very helpful up to date info. Couldn't do it without you TripAdvisor!!!
Version 5.5 2011-04-18 5
Good AP. Needs a little work seems my AP has a glitch in the area where it locates restaurants. Other than that , I luv it
Version 5.7 2011-07-25 5
I can't really ask for anything for anything else from this app. Does what it says well.
Version 5.9 2011-12-22 5
I have been using the app for over a year now and being avid traveller, I simply love the app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
I found this app very useful while traveling to find a hotel for our next stay in Italy.
Version 6.6 2013-02-17 5
Made planning my vacation very simple. Great information
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-14 3
Can't sore reviews by star rating, lame.

Keeps demanding to post thugs on my behalf and won't let me sign in via Facebook when I click no, lame.

I'll still use it, but under protest.
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 5
Works great on vacation in unfamiliar territory to find good places to eat and to stay.
Version 8.2 2013-12-03 1
I downloaded an update and now the flight search doesn't work. I appreciate the easy access to reviews of restaurants and other places. Really what I liked about the app is how accurate the flight search has been. I've compared Trip Advisor to other flight search engines and it always found the best deal for me. Please fix!!
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
I use it to look for places near me- in the US and in Europe. It's never failed me! It's the ultimate in honest - the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
Hands down my favorite travel app; very well put together! Thanks Trip Advisor.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
Trip Advisor helped me plan our beach trip to Tybee Island. We didn't miss a thing thanks to Trip Advisor!!!
Version 6.3 2012-09-07 5
We don't go anywhere w/o first checking TripAdvisor!
Version 6.6 2012-11-11 5
Works great to make eating and lodging decisions. Gives all kinds of ideas of things to do.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-03 3
Not as good as the website! Hope to add more filters (such as dining options), also clicking "back" after choosing a restaurant clears the previous filter and I get the main list!
Version 5.93 2012-03-07 5
This app makes it so much easier to search for the best deals on flights! No more annoying pop ups! I love it!
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 5
Before and during every trip.
Version 6.6 2013-04-12 5
I am a new Trip Advisor user.  A friend recommended it.  So far, it seems to be very easy to use and a great travel planning tool.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
Would never stay anywhere without referring to TripAdvisor.
Version 5.8 2011-11-24 5
This is a great tool when you are traveling to find out where you need to be.
Thanks trip advisors!
Version 5.93 2012-03-13 5
Wonderful app, gives me a piece of mind when searching for hotels ect For my family
Version 6.0 2012-03-16 5
Really like the new app for the iPad. Have always enjoyed the site, now I get to enjoy it as much on my iPad.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 4
Good but not great app significantly improved with recent enhancements. Nice place to use as a starter when trying to find something for dinner.
Version 6.6 2012-11-22 5
I review just about every place I go to. Also when we go to a hotel I look at reviews to see what we are in for.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 4
I do wish there were better mapping functions. I'd like to be able to plan activities and eating near each other or on transit lines.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-15 5
Love being able to look up the specific areas I'm visiting and have LOCALS chiming in too!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-05 5
I use it when I travel and have always found something new and fun to do.
Version 6.4 2012-09-09 5
Love using this app.  It is great.  Lots of fun to see whats around you and look at reviews.  It is so helpful for traveling.
Version 6.6 2012-10-22 4
Fine mostly, but there's no way to tell a reviewer that his/her review was helpful in the iPad app. I had to go to the site using Safari to do that.
Version 6.6 2012-10-04 5
This is a handy app for traveling. Easy to use and functional. Have not had any tech issues with it.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 2
I love trip advisor and I use to love the app. You can't just look at hotels in an area. You have to go through the search process and if that hotel isn't available those dates then it's not on a list. It's just not as user friendly as it use to be and it's really disappointing.
Version 5.7 2011-07-22 5
This app has been extremely helpful on our vacation. Can't beat it.
Version 5.8 2011-08-23 5
This is a great app.  It is so easy to maneuver all your travel needs and dreams in a single app.I don,t want to travel without it.
Version 6.4 2012-09-08 5
Easy to sort through reviews and search for hotels.
Version 6.6 2013-04-08 5
Nice tool to find local places and share feedback
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 3
We thought it was a good experience. Service was excellent!  The only complain was the presentation  of the lobster Roll, served on white toast with no lettuce or tomato, the lobster salad was excellent but the white bread took away from the taste!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-21 5
Trip adviser helps me find all my info when traveling. 99% of the time it's right on.
Version 5.8 2011-10-17 5
Using app now for vacation. Last minute things to do is great. Luv it & use it weekly
Version 6.0 2012-04-01 4
It's one of my dependable apps.  Solid reference, good interface.  Maps can be a bit quirky on iPhone and iPad at times.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 4
Very good & practical app. Most reviews are right on the money. If you're looking for a family place, reasonable prices, this app the best!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
A great and reliable travel tool. I have found the reviews to be very accurate
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 5
They have made this app extremely useful for for travel.  Easy to navigate.
Version 6.6 2013-03-27 5
Using trip advisor is so easy and helpful to get advice on places to go, stay and see.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
This app helps me avoid terrible restaurants when I travel.  So far, no surprises. Thank you!
Version 8.5 2014-03-22 5
I refuse to go anywhere without checking it out on trip advisor. MUST HAVE APP!!!!!!
Version 5.7 2011-08-06 4
So many people read and use this app it can be quite reliable.  Learn to read btwn the lines and interpret some people's accounts and you will do well...
Version 5.9 2011-11-13 5
Very useful especially when on location.  Many helpful reviews.
Version 5.9 2011-12-11 4
Love the app. Just put in the name of the place and you can see all tripadvisor ratings, prices, etc.  really useful for planning a road trip up the CA coast.
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 4
It didnt leave enough information about the places so it was hard to tell what things were
Version 5.8 2011-10-06 5
This app has helped improve several trips I made via great recommendations.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 3
My big gripe about this app is it's search ability.  It is not intuitive and if you don't spell the restaurant name exact, you won't find it.  When the fix that, I'll give it four stars.
Version 6.4 2012-08-19 5
It's nice to have an app that you can honestly rate an experience bot good and bad. I would recommend.
Version 6.6 2013-02-22 5
Very well organized, easy to use and search
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 4
Just downloaded app. Starting to plan first trip outside U.S. Has been very helpful thus far. Guess I'll know how good it was when I get back.
Version 8.4 2014-02-04 5
Definitely one of the most helpful apps out there for travelers
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
I am practically checking flights from bed ((-:
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
Would not book a trip without checking here 1st.
Version 8.5 2014-03-18 5
I love this app. When ever I travel anywhere, I rely on the reviews of others and am never disappointed!!
Version 5.8 2011-08-11 5
Booked a bed and breakfast and made reservations at a restaurant while we drove to Florida!  Amazing!
Version 5.8 2011-10-14 5
I'll never travel without it again...always use it at home, but now I can use it anywhere!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-15 3
I try to write a review. I am logged in properly.  I complete the review and I get an error message to fix the area that is red. I can not complete the review.    There is no way to contact or report this error.  I would like the app except for this.
Version 6.5 2012-09-28 4
This app is helpful when traveling. I take the time to look before I go and once I get there. I often rely on bad reviews as good advice!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
When traveling, this is my go to app for finding restaurants & other info
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-29 5
Kids loved the pool, the room was large and affordable, staff was great!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
This is a great tool that comes in very handy both at home planning a trip and on the road looking for a place to stop and rest.
Version 5.9 2012-01-10 5
I don't know what I would do without this app while traveling. Extremely helpful!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Easy navigation for all kinds of travel. Great for "road trippers" like us being right on our iPhones.
Version 6.4 2012-08-19 5
This app is a life saver.  I love to keep up on reviews of my favorite upcoming vacation spots.  This makes it so easy and fun.
Version 5.7 2011-07-26 5
Look through it all and it feels like you been there done that.  It's very detailed.  Awesome
Version 5.8 2011-09-11 3
I have tried to use this application to get info on very well known attractions & restaurants in the areas I visit & frequently they don't pull up.  I have to go to another site.  What I do get on this site is very good.
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 2
I use trip advisor often, so I was glad to see an iPad app option.  I prefer apps over websites for 90% of my most frequented sites. The trip advisor app is clumsy, and not as flexible .  It is useful for places you are, not so much for places you want to check out.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
I liked older versions of this app and have used it on many vacations. The new iPad version (April 2012) which I'm using on wifi does not work here in Zanzibar and I'm having to read all of the content on the web browser - while minimizing pop-up offers about there being a free app I can download. What a pain.
Version 8.1 2013-11-10 4
I'm a huge Yelp fan, but this has it beat in the hotel/motel department.  More reviews are always better especially the less than flattering ones!
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
This is an amazing app for anyone who's traveling. It's great to see pictures and opinions from guests.
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
I got this app for a trip to Wisconsin and it was great. I wish I would have installed this a long time ago!
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 5
I thought it was very informative directions and pictures lots of help in planning a trip
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 5
If you like to travel this app is a must have to ensure you don't miss a thing. This app gives you great places to eat, sleep, and see!
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
Very helpful to get the point of view of others before booking hotels, or visiting restaurants.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
Trip Advisor is the only way to go! Very helpful when needing to find a new destination . Cheers!
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
This is the best travel app i've used! It's quick, easy to navigate and a humongous time saver! Best thing? It's free!
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 4
Unfortunately I haven't quite how to weed out the dreck written by hotel/restaurant staffers.
Overall a useful tool, but helps sometimes to get a 2nd opinion.

Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 5
Helped me plan my trip to Germany with ease. Amazingly easy to use and has a great user community
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-25 5
Simple, informative traveling companion for wandering a new city.
Version 5.6 2011-08-12 4
The best part about the app is the street view. It's important for me to see the area around a hotel. I used it when choosing a hotel in Times Square and I was not disappointed.
Version 6.1 2012-04-10 4
What a great app!  New upgrade app not as user friendly when navigating content to content.  Sure Trip Advisor will remedy the challenge.  If it ain't broke, why fix it?
Version 6.3 2012-07-20 5
Thank you i trust your information in arranging my trips and get a lot of benefits
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5
One of the best travel app. could find 90% of information I need.
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 5
Great to read about places before you go.  Makes it easier to decide where to go.
Version 5.92 2012-01-31 5
I love being able to do a search and having all the info you will ever need pop up in seconds. Great app!!!
Version 6.2 2012-06-29 5
My husband and I do a fair amount of traveling in and out of the country. We use this all the time!
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
At home or on vacation, an informative and reliable source of places to eat, stay and play!
Version 7.0 2013-05-01 5
Trip advisor is always informative and often entertaining.  Wouldn't travel without it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-11 5
Works well when you're looking up places on the go. Solid reviews.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-16 2
Why is this app so childish looking. Eyes that look like they are from an owl? Looks like a children's Learning or book app. It would be so much better with a picture of a city or some kind of landscape. Most of these apps look like for a 15 to 25 year old. Where are all the adult apps?
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-04 5
What a great app. Easy to use, info is accurate and everything you need to know as a traveler or tourist!
Version 5.8 2011-10-28 5
Very easy to locate the hotel i reserved 
Site is easy navigate and appealing. 
Will use more often.
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 5
A friend suggested this app. I am very happy with it.  A broad spectrum of choices at your finger tips.  Thank you!
Version 6.5 2012-09-26 5
What did I do without this app?  It's great!  I trust reviews that I read on Trip Advisor!  I leave reviews for every place I go!
Version 8.3 2013-12-31 4
many places I've been and had no idea about them, tripadvisor helped me to know a lot more and get around
Version 5.8 2011-11-05 5
Where to stay and where to eat is no for me no headache, thanks to TripAdvisor.

Version 5.8 2011-09-11 5
Very useful app. I used trip advisor to book my honeymoon 3 years ago. Can't go wrong with this!
Version 5.8 2011-10-18 5
I've always loved tripadvisor! I'm glad it's an ap and even more happy that it's very user friendly!
Version 5.9 2011-12-15 5
I really like how easy it is to find locations, write reviews and find the best values in the area.
Version 5.92 2012-01-24 5
Always a pleasure to find something useful that makes planning easier, thanks TripAdvisor!
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 4
I'd be lost without access to Trip Advisor.  The app works well and provides me the information I need.  What more could you want?
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
Just what you would expect from Trip Adviser. The best travel app I have seen!
Version 6.6 2013-01-08 5
Love how easy it is to find reviews on restaurants and hotels
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 1
The app used to be tolerable, but after just updating to the latest version, I clicked to view some forums and there is NO way to get out of them and back to the main app.  Even closing the app doesn't work as it just re-opens in the same dead end.  Obviously this wasn't well tested before being released!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-25 5
I've been a much more savvy traveler since I started using TripAdviser. I use it on every trip.
Version 5.6 2011-06-06 5
They did a beautiful job bringing this App to iPad. Really great presentation and very intuitive, simple UI! Nicely done.
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 5
Not so different from the website
It's straight forward easy to use!
Version 5.9 2011-12-11 5
I use it for everything from local restaurants to attractions and hotels on our trips!
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
Always check here and will write reviews to return the help
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 1
Used to be excellent. I've written many resteraunt reviews, it was my "go to travelling place" while out of town and in town. But now since the last upgrades, my app crashes before it even opens. I tried deleting and reinstalling, and nothing. So sad, it was great before. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise, but I had to delete my app completely. ;(
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
The interface on the iPad app is a lot better than the website.
Version 6.5 2012-09-15 4
Always helpful from hotels, restaurants to general location info. Great reviews and pics as well as easy access to specific hotel/restaurant sites.
Version 6.6 2012-10-23 4
It's pretty good given some limitation of the search be more specific or apply more filters. Harder to get hotel detailed info.
Version 6.6 2012-10-31 5
Trustworthy - gives a true picture of hotels, restaurants etc - well-designed too
Version 6.6 2012-12-14 2
-- Does not allow you to save forum postings that might interest you.
-- Does not allow copying of text.
-- Needs to have an easy way to filter out older posts. Major nuisance to be inundated with posts from 2005. Come on.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-18 4
I have found trip advisor useful in making travel decisions although sometimes it is hard to vet the advisors
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5
Great Design and Simple to use....error free.  What more can you ask of an app?  Has become a top 20 app for me.
Version 6.2 2012-06-26 5
Use the website/app to check out any hotel or resort before going booking a vacation.
Version 6.6 2013-02-22 4
The navigation not accurate, double check.  Other wise great app!  Would have been 5/5
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-12 5

I always use tripadvisor for restaurants, things to do and campsites. App is even easier to navigate!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 3
I travel a lot and the older app made it much easier to submit a new restaurant that was not shown in trip advisor.  Seems like this new version is set up more for people who don't write reviews.
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5
I use this frequently while traveling to find restaurants to eat at and expeditions to take. Love the reviews!
Version 6.5 2012-09-16 5
It's very useful and intuitive. I've used TripAdvisor's website, but I like the iPad version even better.
Version 6.6 2012-11-21 5
Than trying to look up all hotels in an area individually
Version 5.7 2011-06-30 5
Just added it a few minutes ago and I'm hooked. Better to navigate than the mobile site.
Version 5.8 2011-09-24 5
Great user community, multitude of reviews. No bugs found yet. Very easy to use.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 4

Beautiful view and easy access to metro.

Version 5.92 2012-01-30 5
The app is awesome.  If you want to find out anything about a hotel/ property, just use this app. Bayou won't regret it!!!
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 4
I use this app every time I travel. It has helped us to find many restaurants and attractions we would have missed otherwise.
Version 6.6 2013-01-14 3
Very helpful great to have it but why some review they are not publish in here, I wrote negative regarding, Best Westen hotel in Myrtle Beach, they dont want to publish. I hope this is not like BBB agency, paying money for get good review things.
Version 5.3 2011-05-14 4
I've been using it to look up restaurants primarily. Very helpful. Sometimes the map doesn't display all of the places that are on the list, but still this is a great resource!
Version 5.8 2011-08-16 4
We like the app, but location was wrong many times, it's better to call the place to verify.
Version 6.1 2012-04-30 5
It is very informatics web for your compare the hotels, air ticket. It is useful for travellers.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5

Just started using this App and it's very informative ... I'm planning a trip to Puerto Rico and so far I've learned more info here than several other sites combined
Version 5.92 2012-02-12 5

Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 4
I like the app, it's easy and fun to use, but not all attractions always show up...but it does not glitch and the updates only make it better, so it's pretty cool
Version 5.93 2012-03-04 5
It really make my trip more interesting and we don't lost time... Congratulations for all informations!!!!!
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 4
I like this App. Trip Advisor is easy to navigate and seems to have reliable information from people who take the time to write thoughtful reviews.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-01 5
Always on travel and I use this app everywhere
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 5
The app is a great way to research a city and the way it shows pictures and reviews is really easy to use
Version 5.1 2010-11-07 2
Works well for finding restaurants and hotels, but is impossible to use for any review writing, say when you are fresh from the experience. Interface is very limited.  Does not have forward browsing, does not store incomplete reviews.  Often frustrating.
Version 5.9 2012-01-22 5
Real people relaying their experience is the best advice you can get.
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 5
Perfect for those who travel. I use it on every 1st time destination
Version 6.6 2012-12-18 4
This is very useful tool if you search for restaurant or hotel. I wish you can have reviews for other things.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-08 2
The ipad app needs to be improved. 
There are many bugs. Like the pictures in full mode keep on repeating. The app is slow in response many times. The app seems to be just a web page loading in the app. 
Pls. Improve. Tripadvisor is a great and useful portal.
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-02 5
If you dig TripAdvisor's website, this is a no-brainer. The restaurant reviews are very helpful too. This is the review app I use the most - and it's free :-).
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
We have used trip advisor for so many vacations and special family events! Great info!
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 4
I never go anywhere without checking this site for hotel, restaurant and things-to-do suggestions. Indispensable
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 1

Version 5.92 2012-01-29 4
My daughter is excited about landing an upcoming trip and got this app.  I looked into it and have found tons of useful info.  Will use in definitely.

Very nice to have when traveling!  I use it to find hotels, restaurants, and places to go.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-25 4
Trip Advisor guides us to restaurants and other destinations we never would have found otherwise. We use it a lot when traveling.
Version 3.0 2009-03-03 1
I have heard of the trip advisor on the net.. Pretty sure my wife & I have used it.. I am disappointed at this app; this app is limited in information. I loved the sorting by all categorical descriptions and distance, but it seems the list is limited to 20 or so restaurants?? What is that about?!? I was searching 10 miles but limited to 2.38 miles.. Am I doing something wrong? Frusterating!!
Version 5.5 2011-05-02 4
Trip Advisor is one of my favorite sites and this app allows me to read and write reviews on the go. I just came back from a long trip and I reviewed all my hotels.
Version 5.8 2011-09-16 5
This app is so user friendly and helpful, I just can't wait to use it on travel!
Version 6.6 2012-10-27 5
I use this app a ton when traveling. All the info is spot on and the reviews are very helpful.
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 5
This is a must-have app for anyone who travels no matter where or how far they go.  Lots of good information.
Version 6.6 2013-02-13 5
A wonderful travel resource. I use it all the time, hope the community keeps growing.
Version 8.2 2013-12-07 3
I just downloaded this app. 
Logged in.
Can't find reviews that I know that I've written.
As a new owner of one of the establishments, it's important for me to see ALLLL of the reviews that effect my business!
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 4
I love this app although I wish it would give you the total price of multiple travelers and not just the individual price
Version 5.7 2011-07-30 5
Now I can keep track of who, what and where and how was it as we are on the go. Perfect for those of us who never stay home!
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 4
The app is pretty good unless you want to change your search options.  Sometimes you have to close the app and restart to make changes
Version 6.6 2013-03-27 5
Tikki is fantastic. Great sense of humor. Dine out on the terrace and enjoy the view and great food!
Version 8.0 2013-10-13 1
Most of the hotel reviews, especially from poor hotels, are fake and most likely posted by employees. Notice how after a negative review is posted, it is invariably followed by several glowing reviews. And because TripAdvisor is paid by the hotels listed on this site they will remove negative reviews if pressured by the hotel.
Version 5.9 2012-01-20 5
Great App! Came as a surprise when I was looking for a restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale. We tried the #1 rated restaurant. It was great and immaculate!  I was hooked.
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 4
I like this app. It's definitely great to use when you're traveling and you need to find good places for food and entertainment;-)
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 5
I love this app! It makes planning our family vacation easier!
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Time to start planning the next trip?  You don't even have to get off the couch...
Version 5.7 2011-07-12 5
Great to have trip advisor app as we travel. I base hotel restaurant and activity choices based on Trip Advisor reviews.
Version 5.93 2012-02-28 5
Great. Have almost everything you need. Good features organization too.
Version 5.93 2012-03-03 4
Needs more people to give thier input....a regular persons view of places is waaayyybetter thansome snobby review like one can find inthe 1% ers new york times...
Version 5.7 2011-08-06 5
This makes every trip easier to plan from things to do to cost of trip. I love it
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
I use it whenever I am considering a new hotel or restaurant, inside or out of the US.  Good to see different experiences.
Version 6.1 2012-05-06 2
This is a fairly good app to start your trip browsing, but you will find that some of the place pins for the hotels and restaurants are completely wrong.  This is not good if you are trying to find one of them by driving or walking to the point shown on the map.
Version 6.3 2012-07-21 5
I downloaded it when I am travel. It helps me a lot. It have everything about trip in one app.
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 1
The former app was so user friendly and laid out well for navigation.  The update, October 3, is more cumbersome, harder to get back to home screen, has no "back screen" button that I've found.  Map isn't even as easy to see and read.  Am so tired of companies "updating" their apps just for the sake of updates!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-18 2
I walk by some businesses or hotels & search them on this app & don't show up!!? seems it's more advertising agency that gets a business exposed if it throws them some dough $$!! Like the other app. yuck or yelb. Come on such a scammers.

People are smarter than that.
Version 5.6 2011-05-18 5
Nobody tells it better than people like me who've traveled there.  Awesome tool!
Version 6.5 2012-09-15 5
I love this app. It was very useful in finding hotels that except pets for an upcoming trip.
Version 6.5 2012-09-23 5
I was in Sedona last month and relied on trip advisor suggestion on food and things to do. Very helpful.
Version 5.5 2011-04-15 5
This app is awesome.  Love the side by side hotels and map.  We had lots of fun planning trip to London .  Would recommend to friends.

Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5
Used it throughout my Hawaii trip. Tripadvisor alerted me to the dangers of the walu fish just before I ordered it.. Thanks!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 4
Amazing application for Tripadvisor. I just hope it is more adequate to use for Ipad and I really wish if it were easier to add new places there.
Version 6.6 2012-10-11 4
My reviews always post and stay posted unlike yelp where they remove legitimate reviews and call it "filtering"
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
So handy! Use trip advisor to plan out where to stay and whereto eat and other tips. Hasn't failed me yet!
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 5
Great App. Have now used it in Paris and Rio de Janeiro and I was able to find some great restaurants within walking distance.
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5
I like to preview where I'm going and dream about upcoming vacations. Tripadvisor can be trusted
Version 6.0 2012-03-14 5
So far the reviews have been great, we found restaurants off the beaten path. I love the map showing where we are
Version 6.1 2012-05-03 4
It also is a good outlet to express your make your opinions count. Great app. Would travel without it.
Version 6.1 2012-05-23 5
Best travel app. Specially good for international travel. For local, I would suggest a combination of yelp and tripadvisor.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Many thanks fly out to developers. Great work!
Version 6.1 2012-05-21 2
Like the previous post, I want to love this app, but I can't...too many bugs. I can't access my TA account, not all places listed on website are available on the app-site (why/how is that possible?). I couldn't even find where or how to contact TA. Please fix this app so it is workable!
Version 6.1 2012-06-05 5
Love this app, we have used it everyday of our vacation & it has been very helpful.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Friendly design, perfect source of insiders info on places. Thanks to all who benefit!
Version 5.5 2011-06-16 2
When trying to compare changes to itinerary it defaults back to today's date and one has to remember to keep putting in the proposed future dates over and over again. Also, does not find inexpensive flights compared to orbitz and priceline...
Version 5.8 2011-08-20 5
I have been using it to plan my trip on the go and it's so helpful! It's easy to use and full of good ideas. Use it!
Version 6.2 2012-07-16 5
Use this app when looking for new places to eat and visit when I travel.

Trip adviser has been a great help on our travels thus far. Made travel decisions so much quicker! Nice!
Version 6.2 2012-06-21 4
This is a great app for hotel comparison. Although you will get a lot more info going to the website, if you are on the go you can't beat it.
Version 5.9 2012-08-09 2
It's an OK app overall. Clean and sharp looking. Simple, and there's the drawback.

Needs some better filtering or tag functionality. 

Blocks you if you do not have the most up to date copy of the app. Happened at the most inopportune time and made the app useless.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5
Using this app to ""re-find" all the places we left behind on a notepad at home.  !!
Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5

Version 6.6 2012-11-03 5
Tripadvisor is the best . I wonder why apple incorporated crooked yelp into its maps and not tripadvisor. !!
Version 5.5 2011-05-14 5
I am the first to see what others think before I book a place. Thanks to trip advisor I can do just that.
Version 5.6 2011-05-17 5
Has helped so much with finding rooms when traveling for baseball tournaments.
Version 5.9 2011-11-01 5
In my opinion, TripAdvisor is the most consistent review data available today.
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 4
I always use trip to get a feel of the best places to stay. I dont always trust the reviews due to the fact that some folks cannot be satisfied.
Version 6.6 2013-03-26 3
The app is decently functional.  Be careful of the maps.  My wife and I followed the map and the directional indicator on a bike ride to find a restaurant.  We ended up about 30 kilometers from the actual restaurant.
Version 5.5 2011-04-26 5
Using it more & more on trips to find good food & hotels. Most people have give great, honest reviews.

I travel for my job and I love having this program to fall back on!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 1
Can't see any reason why this is locked in landscape mode. Dumb. Deleted. Fix and will try again.

Update after update...still a piece of crap. No longer sideways, but can't scroll through pictures. Pictures hang, go backwards instead of forward, and repeat same one over again. 

Come on. How hard can it be?
Version 8.5 2014-03-21 5
Planning my trip to Vegas and found plenty to do off this app...thanks

When I have my location off and enter a location for a restaurant , I get the message that I must be connected to the Internet.  I have an active service.  When I tried Yelp, the connection worked just fine. Trip advisor always worked before and was my favorite travel app.  Sorry to say this doesn't work for me anymore.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-18 5
Thank you tripadvisor that can help me in my job.

This app has been extremely helpful during my vacations. Keep up the good work.
Version 5.6 2011-08-14 4
As a floor manager at a restaurant I love using trip advisor to help make changes in our restaurant. It's easy and fun, wish it had more on the mobile app tho.
Version 5.8 2011-10-15 5
I love this app. It offers everything from the website all in the palm of my hand.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
A great app to see what people think about local attractions, fare, and lodging.  A must have in my opinion.  Check it out!
Version 6.2 2012-07-11 5
This app provides everything you need to sort out which hotels are really a good value.
Version 5.6 2011-07-04 5
Always my first stop for travel info.  Especially the photos which tell a lot about hotels.
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
Used trip advisor before trips now I can use this wonderful app all the time
Version 6.1 2012-04-03 5
Great, super handy when you are in new places, is just like to have a local friend : )
Version 6.1 2012-04-23 4
The app is nice but the only thing I don't really like is that it only works in landscape mode. Other than that it is quick.
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 4
In a few words great app.  I could never use trip advisor on my desk hop.  Don't know why but this app has made it and the services accessible.  I love it!
Version 6.4 2012-09-10 5
Lots of great options. Love that ratings are done by people who've been there. Word of "mouth" is priceless.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-21 5

There's nothing better than TripAdvisor!  Download the app and see for yourself!  Excellent & accurate content!!!
Version 5.8 2011-09-09 5
This is a great app for travel planning and is very easy to use.
Version 5.8 2011-10-08 5
Trip Advisor is the best thing that happened to travel planning and travel ... Rely on it all the time ... Couldn't do without it.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 3
The web site s so much better. At the constant prodding of trip advisor web site to download the app on my iPad, I finally did it.  I am deleting it and sticking with the web site.  Love trip advisor, the app is not user friendly at all.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 4
I used this app for the 1st time on a trip to myrtle beach and it really helped weed out all the paid endorsements I saw for restaurants and made our choices much easier.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 5
Super useful, love that it can find restaurants super close and bring me right to the menu.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
If one is looking for an app to find a restaurant with reviews in whatever city, town, or area you're in TripAdvisor is the one.
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 4
The portions were good size. The beef pie is outstanding! Loved the shrimp and muscles. Go for lunch you'll be stuffed. Great chef and wonderful history place near Independence Hall.
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 5
It's simple the best help to find what ever you need. Highly recommended!
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5

Very useful and like to read reviews when traveling
Version 5.9 2012-01-29 5
Love this app! I rely on this app to plan my trip and make reservations! Simply the perfect travel companion!
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 1
This used to be a great app. The new version is very slow, and freezes while every page is loading. Tap on the wrong category (e.g., "places to stay" rather than "things to do") and you'll have to wait for all the places to stay to load, along with the map, before you can switch topics. And this was supposed to be an improvement?
Version 6.6 2013-04-05 5
Trip advisor has been easy to use   Making it an invaluable tool
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 5
Very helpful while on vacation with complete reviews & lots of helpful links.

Thank you for easy handling and informative app. It helped me in my trips in flight as well as hotel booking. I recommend it.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-20 1
I've been using this app for some time now. I love it when it works and I love doing reviews but tonight I'm in Billings,  MT at the Spring Hill Suites. I'm using near me and it don't show at all.   I've stayed in Billings many times and this is one of the better hotels - it shouldn't be this hard to rate something.  Guys I know you can do better than this
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
I can't wait to take this with me on my next trip! Very useful! Easier to use than the original!
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 3
I enjoy TripAdvisor & generally like the app overall however I can no longer access the photos (& others seem to have a problem). Update/fix this & I'd add a star.
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
I can't travel without tripadvisor. Invaluable customer advice.
Version 6.6 2013-03-07 4
Just as good as web version, just on thing missing... There are no links to see websites of hotels, restaurants, activities, etc...
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-19 5
I really enjoy the app.  It is easy to use as both a user and a contributes.  I highly recommend it
Version 5.7 2011-09-25 5
Awesome app... Can't beat the community reviews on TripAdvisor.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 2
Very disappointed in the map feature with Bing. We picked some good restaurants using "near me now", but when I tried to locate using the map feature there is no marker to help me find it.  This bug significantly reduces the mobile friendliness of TA. PLEASE FIX!
Version 6.1 2012-04-11 4
Like reviews from visitors and real pictures...tells it like it really is, not what hotels want you to think.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
Use it often. Lots of reviews available. And I get to share my experiences as I travel.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-13 5
I consult trip advisor for every trip I take. A plethora of helpful info available.
Version 5.6 2011-06-03 4
I came to Mumbai, India using this app for picking my hotel and looking for things to do. Simple, powerful, informed honestly and easy to use! Great App!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-30 3
Information is not always up-to-date and location services has trouble with this app. Needs much improvement to become mainstream and competitive with others.
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 5
I don't plan a trip without consulting tripadvisor.  Now I can research no matter where I am! This is great!
Version 5.8 2011-10-23 5
This site give great reviews on hotels.  I will always check this site before I book a room.
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 5
Really helpful and Esau to navigate. We are planning our honeymoon with this as our main tool.

Very easy to use, lots of photos & valid reviews, clean link to web sites, & very robust.
Version 6.6 2012-09-30 5
Since I am an avid traveler, I use mine to save photos and remind myself of hotels I liked.
Version 6.6 2012-10-17 5
Which is much better than yelp.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-01 4
Good app. But don't bring me all the way back to the first page after pushing "list". Just go back 1 page.
Version 5.7 2011-07-22 5
Simple to use... Complete details on whatever you're researching. Get this app!
Version 6.6 2013-02-07 5

Real reviews from real travelers.  Wonderful reference app. Things to do, restaurants and hotels at a touch.
Version 6.1 2012-06-13 5
Absolutely perfect tool in helping us of finding everything we need!
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 3
Big help finding restaurants in my area.  Only problem I had, ever time I saved a restaurant to favorites, the app took me back to the  first page. If I had been on page 4 or 5, it was a nuisance. Other than that, I love it.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Very informative. Great idea to get some insight for your next travel destination.
Version 6.6 2012-11-29 2
I find this app frustrating to use. Hard to do a search for anywhere but the largest cities. After reading reviews you have to hit the back button through all the reviews you read to get back to you search.
Version 2.0 2008-08-07 5
I have a very nice experience traveling to places you never been there before works nice very helpfull
Version 5.4 2011-04-16 5
Good app and handy if you are looking for something touristy to do near you while on vacay!
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
I always use it when in unfamiliar territory, and it has been reliable 100% of the time!

One of the best apps that allows customers to grade the hospitality industry.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 4
I use this app when traveling. Found some diamonds in the rough when visiting new places. Love to rate where we go also.
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 5
Easily found hotels in Alsace area of France & Baden-Baden area of Germany that were wonderful places & great value!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
I was on a trip to Florida and was told about this app. By a friend. I started using it and it has been very helpful.
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 5
A well thought out app! Useful and easy to navigate! Love this app!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-11 1
This used to be my favorite app. Now it's un-intuitive, difficult and frustrating to navigate and it drives me crazy that when you try to look at pictures, you're brought first to photos supplied by the business, which defeats the purpose of the app in the first place. Please bring back the old interface.
Version 5.5 2011-05-03 5
Just what I was hoping. Allows me to do travel research easily on my iPad. Thank you!
Version 5.6 2011-06-24 4
Great to have all the info on my phone. The search "near me now" is a great feature. The map was a bit off in Glasgow which is why I don't give it 5 stars.
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 5
Just found this app, love the pictures and reviews. This will save us some time for sure!
Version 5.7 2011-08-16 5
Just downloaded this app and can already tell I will get a lot of use out of it!
Version 5.93 2012-03-03 5
Find hotels when searching...best app but need to improve at the check rates.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
This is a must have for travelers. The reviews are as helpful, if not more, than a guide book.
Version 6.6 2013-02-27 5
Found this app when we went our trip. It was useful to help us find things to do.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-28 3
I think the map feature on the iPad app is confusing. Not ever sure how the location gets selected and if not familiar with city would prefer to select an area, ie downtown, airport, etc.
Version 3.0 2008-12-05 4
The new update is very well put together; great job to the developers who redesigned this app. It was pretty ok before but now has a more cohesive navigation to it. Well done!!
Version 5.8 2011-08-12 4
This app has been really helpful on my current trip. Searching for restaurants and things to do has been really easy. Thanks!

Love the forums and insight into hotels too! Thanks for keeping us safe and clean too (nice hotels)

We use this app all the time on vacation. It's great to see what other people think before we try something new.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
I use it all the time when planning my trips. Actually like the app better than the website. Nice job TA!
Version 6.0 2012-03-29 4
It would be even greater and save me much time if I cod free on amenities. I'm looking for hotels with pools only. I don't see that I can do that here.
Version 5.7 2011-07-29 5
Thanks to all those travelers who invest the time to share their experiences! Much appreciated!
Version 5.8 2011-09-04 5
I use this app everyday when I travel.  I recommend it highly.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
Better than the American Express card - DEFINITELY don't leave home without it!!!!
Version 6.6 2013-04-04 5
I love the website as well. The app makes finding hotels with reviews a breeze.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 5
Very helpful and very easy to use to book hotels and flights.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-20 3
I enjoy using trip advisor and would probably post more reviews if I could see a list and access my own reviews from the app.
Version 8.2 2013-12-11 5
Just wish on the app I could see my reviews. Other than that it's great!
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
Great! A user-friendly mobile version of the online site. Perfect while out on location!
Version 5.92 2012-02-15 5
Count on TripAdvisor on my computer and now I have it even closer and when I need it!

...when traveling.  The restaurant app alone is worth it's weight in gold.  As close as you can come to a personal recommendation!
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 4
This app is extremely useful for finding information on US and international cities. It has more locations listed than yelp!
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5

Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5
One of the best apps I have.  Tremendously useful when I travel.  Definitely a go to resource!
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 5
Excellent app! Has been a huge help on my 2 week road trip to Michigan. Love, love, love Trip Advisor!
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 2
The app search function is crippled.  Is this intentional?

What a pain in the rear end to try to find something.  BTW I love the full web site but this app is but a shadow of it.  Why not make it fully functional before going live?
Version 5.7 2011-08-13 5
I could spend hours searching for places to visit and things to do while I am there!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-10 5
Information is current to what's online and easy to navigate.
Version 5.5 2011-05-06 5
This app works flawlessly & has been a great help planning our honeymoon!
Version 5.6 2011-06-01 3
I found cheaper prices on my own.  This is a good app but it could be great if they would find the better deals.  I searched a flight on a southwest website and saved $300.  Nice try but....work on it and I'll give better score.
Version 5.4 2011-08-11 5
When your visiting a city and need to know whats nearby, this is a great app.

As I was planning our trip this app helped to find the best attractions along the way.
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
Excellent app. I have not been led a stray on any TA recommendations.  I travel extensively and rely on it everywhere I go.
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 4
I just wish it had more of an interactive site like Yelp. Aside from that it is awesome. It helped is so much on our last trip. We did not eat at one bad restaurant thank GOD!!!!
Version 6.6 2012-12-19 5
Use it all the time. Don't trust all the reviews blindly but it's a good starting point.
Version 6.6 2013-01-07 5
This app has saved me lots of money and the reviews are great for finding a good place to stay.
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 5
my default web site for domestic and international trip planning

Version 5.3 2011-08-03 5
Great app, easy to use, very helpful when traveling to new places without a tour guide, it acts as the tour guide!
Version 5.9 2011-11-14 4
Out of town, no idea where to go for anything, this thing seems to have all the answers.  Had trouble narrowing down to one restaurant that was recommended to us.
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 2
Like other reviewers, I'm disappointed at how 'clunky' the interface is.  

The 'Back' button is cumbersome, the 'Home' button still shows the 'Back' button, and the 'Find Attractions' button doesn't do anything.  Pretty weak for an iPhone app IMO...
Version 6.6 2012-11-17 1
Frequent traveler who is more than disappointed in my Hilton Atlanta experience from the long line at check-in, terrible service, and the worst restaurants! Walked out of Traders Vic after sitting for over 10 minutes unacknowledged. Even the bartenders at the hotel bar had an attitude! Frequent traveler who will NEVER stay here again.
Version 5.9 2012-01-10 5
Get this app, it will help you to find the most interesting places to visit and it'll save you time!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-04 5

Version 6.6 2013-04-23 5
It's really great to use trip advisor for the information of hotels all around the globe..
Version 5.6 2011-05-19 5
I use this application whenever I'm out of town.  I have found some great restaurants using Trip Advisor.
Version 5.7 2011-06-27 4
Love the interface. Would like it better if it remembered my last search instead of insisting on going back to my current location.
Version 6.1 2012-05-15 5
Much more convenient than browsing online.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
My favorite restaraunt in Atlantic City. A true Italian menu with great service. The quality of all food is excellent
Version 6.3 2012-07-19 4
Great to read comments from people, but the problem is that the best rated hotels are getting expensive and quickly booked.
Version 5.91 2012-01-17 5
TripAdvisor all delivers... Need an thing else?
Version 6.1 2012-05-26 5
Absolutely love it!!! I never leave town without checking it first!
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 4
iPhone app doesn't let me add new restaurants.  Otherwise, it is a very useful app for travelers.  But, I now enter new properties on Yelp instead of TripAdvisor.
Version 5.6 2011-08-14 5
Easy to use. We have relied on it for several road trips. Indispensable for travel with an iPhone.
Version 5.9 2011-11-11 5
This is a great app and truly invaluable when on a trip
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 5

Version 6.3 2012-08-15 5
Tripadvisor  is awesome backpacker app and well traveller.. Use it for find accomedation. And resto and bars ..
Version 6.6 2013-02-10 1
The best part of the stay was having Mario Villavizencio as our Host.  He was there anticipating our every need!  He was very professional and the best asset we found at Royal Solaris!  If you are planning on staying there, do yourself a favor and request Mario before your arrival!  The facility would not be a five star in our opinion, but Mario definately is!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 5
Very helpful when visiting for the first time
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-12 2
I don't like this app on my iPad.  I would rather use the full website.  It says for me to post a photo on a submitted review from my iPad, I have to use the app.  I need to go to the reviews page in my profile and there is no reviews page that shows up.  This is frustrating!
Version 5.9 2011-10-29 5
Easy site to use, tried a few new places due to this app, handy to take on the road with us!
Version 5.92 2012-02-21 5
I have used TripAdvisor for years and am never disappointed.  It is extremely reliable and comprehensive.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 1
Uninstalled, installed 10/23 version. Won't open. [SIGH!]

-----------

Updated today and now it won't open!

RE: Prev version

Crashes when I try to write a review from my iPhone 4s! Where is the quality control?!

Also, photos are no longer dated. How are we to know how recent a photo is, especially since they may (and often are) not displayed in date order?
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 5
I love Trip Advisor for helping me to find great out of the way places (with great reviews).

Very useful apps. I am very proud to share this apps to my friends and colleagues....good job
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 4
Love it! Only wish I could select hotel amenities (pet friendly, etc.) like on the iPad version. Like that it syncs my saved locations!
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 5
No fads. No frills. No fancy stuff. Just does what it's supposed to do. We use it whenever we're out and about.

Great app for everything you are used to with the main website!
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5
Easy to use, combines basic info,  location, photos and reviews well.
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 2
2 days I have tried to book hotels on the app and it kicked me out when entering payment information each time.  I'm finding it easier to call rather than use the app except I have to look up location and rates before I call.   CN someone work on fixing this?
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
Traveling to off the beaten path Costa Rica but this app still managed to fin places for me to stay at
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
It's absolutely Wonderful! It allows me to get the information I need to travel in one place!
Version 5.0.1 2011-08-18 5
A great resource, and opportunity to share experiences.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 2
Unable to save forum posts that are the most useful suggestions when out on a trip. No Saved Trips that you personally put together to assist you when out & about with your mobile. What good is that? Not many will find a wifi and open their laptop.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-10 5
Anytime I want to know anything about anyplace I am going, this is where I go first.

This app is just as amazing as the Trip Advisor website! Very helpful when on the go,
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 4
It still needs improvement. For example, you can't see your own reviews.
Version 5.92 2012-02-15 5
I find the app to be very robust. It is great to have mobile access to the reviews while on the road. BRAVO!
Version 6.2 2012-07-11 3
Love Trip Advisor, but the app could be more localized and capable of a tighter sort. For example, the ability to search for the closest Italian restaurant with a high rating would be fantastic!
Version 6.6 2013-01-06 5
Anytime we travel I always check trip advisor. Always helpful.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 4

I find it handy for restaurants even when we aren't traveling and can't decide where to go.
Version 5.92 2012-01-27 5
A bit quirky sometimes, but good info provided just like the website.
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 4
Great app that offers a quick means of researching your vacation. It does experience some brief glitches here and then, but overall a great app.
Version 5.92 2012-02-12 4
Good. Only one drawback: every time I have to switch to English language setting in my iPhone, the Chinese interface is not that nice and the translation is terrible.
Version 6.1 2012-06-21 5
As an owner this app allows me to read my reviews, add photos & address any problems post haste!
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
I use TripAdvisor in the US and in Europe and always find the reviews invaluable and generally up to date.
Version 5.4 2011-06-07 4
The AP is really useful to find places to eat while we are out of town. It is taking the guess work out finding a great place to eat.
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
Works very well and comes in handy for places you're not familiar with!
Version 5.8 2011-10-10 4

I have used travel advisor for many, many years.  The reviews have never failed me and I travel a lot!!!!!!!!!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-09 5

Trip Advisor is the best travel app I've used. Easy to navigate, see photos, map, and get a variety of prices.

Used this app to get two hotels while traveling and worked every time. Great app for anyone that travels.

I love this app - Tripadvisor is one of my favorite travels sites and they've done a great job with the app interface!
Version 5.9 2011-12-11 4
This is great app and I use it all the time? That said, Trip Advisor itself needs a lot of help. There are too many 5 star and one star reviews. Reviews older than a year should be devalued.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Started to use it on a Canada trip. Great to use and extremely useful at home and on the road.
Version 5.7 2011-06-26 5

Version 8.0 2013-10-09 5
I hope they add some offline support.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
I am on the road a lot for business and this app has been a lifesaver during my time down.
Version 5.7 2011-10-22 4
Great app for traveling and accessing hotel options on the go....would rate 5 if you listed the direct phone number to hotel .
Version 5.92 2012-01-24 5

I always refer to Trip Advisor for hotel ratings. Really appreciate everyone's reviews! 
Car rentals are an integral part of traveling, so please add a search.
Version 6.6 2013-03-30 5
I love the way it gives you 3 day itinerary, with the most important things to see!!!

Great way to hear from people who have been there and experienced for themselves!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 2
I love trip advisor and I was glad to see an app. Unfortunately I delete it within 10 minutes. It froze a lot and I kept getting stuck only in certain cities while searching for hotels within a small country with no option to go back. Shame.
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 1
I rarely update apps at least for a few weeks to read the reviews on what the update does.  90% of the time it adds an ad window or takes away some function.  Tripadvisor is a shell of what it was before this update.  was my top 5 app on the planet.  Google does much better local searches for food and places to stay now.
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
If you are a traveler this is a tool you really need to make a great vacation.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 4
Used this on our family vacation. We were able to plan our trip and plan what attractions we wanted to see. Great job.

Great way to get honest reviews of traveler's experiences.  I have contributed many reviews.
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 5

Version 5.6 2011-06-25 5
We have used this app many times and have found it extremely useful!  Great app
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
Love this app! Used it extensively while planning an Oregon road trip. Hard to believe it's a free.
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
Best way to compare hotels, especially using the "value" category.
Version 6.1 2012-04-12 5
Use it all the time! We were just in Orlando and used the "attractions near me" option a bunch.
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 5

Version 6.6 2013-01-11 4

Version 6.1 2012-04-16 2
Not sure if I'm not using it right, but it doesn't seem to work for me. 
I can sometime find stuff near me, but can't ever get the list of top attractions/restaurants/anything going correctly.

I much prefer the website - just wish it didn't keep asking for me to download the app...
Version 6.4 2012-08-18 5
Minimal snark and usually on target, the TA reviewers reliably know their stuff.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
I use it all the time traveling for business or family vacation.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-13 5

Easy to use and pretty darn fast wish there was a feature that would send reminders or updates of new flights or new pricing.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Trip advisor gives you all the info you need - good & bad - from people like me.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 4
App needs portrait view so I can input information more easily.  Would get a 5-star rating with that!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-08 5

Version 5.7 2011-06-26 4
Great app but needs to have ability to email links. Love it otherwise.
Version 5.9 2011-10-29 5

Love this site.  I like hearing from real people so that I can get real experiences.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 1
Even after latest bug fix update, still crashing at "search" with ios 5.0.1.
Please fix for ios 5.xx users. PLEASE!!!

New version consistently crashes on "search". Tried dumping and reloading with no luck. Please fix. 

I'm a long time "top contributor" and really miss my iPhone trip advisor.

This app is very easy to use and provides useful information at your fingertips!
Version 6.4 2012-09-01 5
For US travel it is great. Abroad with Internet limitations another app would be better.
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 4
Good app, but does not include the ability to vote a review as helpful.   Works well otherwise.
Version 6.6 2013-01-29 5
Never booked any vacation without going here first
Version 6.6 2013-02-22 3
I am a pet owner and my dog is like my child. I would never travel without her and it would be great to have a "pet friendly" option on the filters menu. Other than that, the app is cool.
Version 5.6 2011-05-30 5
Wish I would have had this during all my world travels from the sixties on!!!
Version 5.5 2011-08-08 5
Easy to use and very useful when planning a trip

Great tool for making reservations in Europe for hotels and restaurants.

Great app when traveling. We've found some good local restaurants with the help of this app.
Version 6.2 2012-06-18 5

I travel all the time and always rely on TA for reviews. Kudos to the iPad App version.
Version 5.7 2011-07-08 5

Version 5.9 2011-12-22 5
Reviews seem honest & very accurate.  Great app!
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
Simple app and easy to navigate. Almost everything you need is there to complement your trips.
Version 6.6 2013-01-18 5
I would never use another app to find hotels, restaurants and attractions for my travels.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-30 5
Always nice to have on vacation to find good restaurants that are not tourist traps or fun things to see and do.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-06 3
Please update this app so it allows you to view your own contributions and/or subscriptions.  I love using trip advisor but I also like reading what I wrote about a particular hotel or restaurant
Version 6.3 2012-07-19 5
More handy than a Swiss Army Knife on the road.  If you travel, this app is a must have!
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
As we wander around enjoying the sunshine on our motorcycle, Trip Advisor is a great resource!
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 4
Good - please add a simple link to profile where you can see pending or past reviews. If it is on there somehow I missed it. Thankya much.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-20 3
I use to love this app but now it's acting up. Every time I try to view the photos for a hotel the screen is blank. You have to physically shut the app down to get it to start working.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 4
Everything works great although I am noticing a lot of duplicates (of restaurants, hotels, etc.). Hopefully that will work itself out in a future update.
Version 5.9 2011-10-30 5
Tripadvisor reviews for hotels, restaurants and activities have not failed me. Thanks people!!!
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 5

Perfect app for travellers... Always found answers to any question about any place!
Version 6.6 2013-02-17 2
This app is horrible in my experience. Takes forever to load, and search and filter options either partially or entirely fail. I've gone back to using the TripAdvisor website through my browser.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 5
I love having this both on my iPhone and iPad to reference when I'm on the road.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-01 5
Great way to find some things to do with good honest reviews.
Version 7.1.1 2013-10-22 4
I can't leave a review on my iphone. The "month visited" feature doesn't work.
Otherwise it's great when traveling.
Version 5.5 2011-05-07 5
Great tool - very useful with gps. Good for fi ding restaurants (especially if you do the know the area)
Version 5.6 2011-06-20 5
Easy to navigate, great info, appealing layout, all around indispensible!
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 3
I generally like the program, but it has a couple of bugs that randomly "kick you" out of the program.  Also, it would be great if it could list more than 20 restaurants at a time.
Version 5.8 2011-11-09 5
Trip advisor has guided me all around the world successfully!!!
Version 5.9 2012-01-03 5

Never ever leave home without consulting tripadvisor
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-12 3
The iPad version has a map feature that seems to be missing. Side by side this iPhone version is not close.

Major improvements with map navigation. I enjoy it eve more in the iPhone. More mobility!
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 5
Want to find the perfect hotel? How about "the best" restaurant near you? Nothing beats Trip Advisor Mobile!
Version 5.7 2011-07-25 5
Use it all the time to find out details about where we're going to.
Version 5.93 2012-03-10 5
This app makes your vacation search much much easier or hotels and attractions.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
Often times you only know how nice a place is by reading what folks had to say about a place. This is a good app for that.
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 4
Love how the site provides pictures and views from the travelers point of view,extremely  accurate.
Good or Bad....

Love this app. It helped me planned my whole trip, like where to stay and eat, what to do around town.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 5
Trip Advisor is very handy & easy to use. All the ratings I have used are accurate. An Excellent App.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 2
Does not seem to allow for locking an address at a destination to search by, would be nice to see what is actually near the destination address instead of "suggested" sites. Hopefully wifi will be available in my "non-suggested" spot.
This is not my idea of a trip planner but it likely will be a help.
Version 5.8 2011-08-19 5
I have found the reviews to be very accurate and count on this app when I travel.  I really love it!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
This app is so helpful when planning a trip, I don't know how we ever planned trips without it.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Trip advisor made our "trip" amazing! Without it we wld have been lost!
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Awesome tool to make concise and precise choices when traveling.

This app is really easy to use and so helpful when trying to make some tough decisions about your trip.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5
Great application for travelers. I am also discovering places around me that I might otherwise miss.
Version 5.8 2011-08-30 2
This app is frustrating in that when you press the back button on the flight search all of your previous flight info that you entered is now gone and you have to re-enter it to modify your search. Why not make it simple to use!?
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 5
Can't go anywhere without checking in!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-13 5
I love this app!! I use it everytime we go out of town. It has led us to many great places :-)

Version 6.1 2012-05-06 4
Nice. Some things are better on iPad and some things are better on desktop. Will use both but mainly iPad app.
Version 6.6 2013-02-11 5

We have used the TA site fir years to plan trips but having the app with us in Italy has made local choices even easier
Version 6.6 2013-01-19 5
Excellent. Love to read the travel forums. Tons of information at my fingertips. Love it!!!
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
I'm looking in a few upcoming vacation spots and this app helped a lot with my itinerary! Great app!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 2
I check this app every couple of days for my work.  Please change it so that once I decline to link to Facebook that you don't force me to open Facebook every time.  It gets annoying and makes me not want to open this app up.
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 5
Good app reviewing many flight and hotels easy to find the best deals
Version 6.1 2012-06-25 5
Never travel without checking trip advisor first !
Version 8.0 2013-10-08 2
Just got back from a trip in Spain and had numerous problems with this app.  It worked differently on the iPhone versus the iPad.  It kept locking up, which meZn I had to constantly "hard restart" my iPhone 5.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-04 5
I like the app but it could use a redesign or add more features
Version 5.6 2011-05-19 5
So helpful. Although wish public transport in rome was available
Version 6.1 2012-04-03 5
I love this app.  Trip advisor is great and this app only makes them better.  Highly recommend.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
I use it for all my travel advice. Dining, entertainment, lodging, etc...all can be found here!
Version 6.3 2012-08-07 5
Great if you're traveling. Real reviews, great ideas for attractions, and super easy to use
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-21 3
Great for finding hotels and reviews but really terrible if you want to access your own reviews. I try to sign in via Facebook and it never works.
Version 5.9 2011-11-22 5
Very Helpful. I was able find what I needed from where I was at Costa Rica. Thank you guys.

My "go to" website when planning vacations. Never disappointed.

I am using it while on vacation to get recommendations on the go. Has already helped in recomendations of where to visit as well as what to avoid.
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 5
My favorite travel site. Used it to plan a recent trip to Charleston, SC and reviews were right on.
Version 5.9 2012-01-08 5
It's a fantastic app that allows u to understand the location u r traveling to and make informed decisions.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
Have used Tripadvisor to help me plan my vacations in the US and South America and for me it is a fantastic tool
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 4
TripAdvisor has so much great information for the business traveller and vacationer, should be a 'must-have' app.
Version 6.6 2012-09-28 5
This app has saved me from going to bad places more than once.
Version 6.6 2013-02-12 5
This app makes it even easier to submit and read reviews!
Congrats Trip Advisor!
Version 8.5 2014-02-28 5
I find this app very easy to use, tons of reviews and great rating system. Love it!!
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 4
The webbrowsig version seems to work better than this app, but the features and ease of use are very intuitive.
Version 5.4 2011-05-20 4
It would be nice to have some additional options but this is already a great app! Thanks for saving me time and money (spent on bad restaurants).
Version 5.8 2011-11-05 5
My husband and I are planning trips for the coming year. This app is great and the info I need is right here. Good job
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5
Trip advisor has absolutely made our trip better!
Version 6.6 2013-03-11 5
Time and again I have found terrific hotels and restaurants with this App.  It is a "must have"!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-16 5
This is my top app when booking a hotel. Reviews are pretty accurate.
Version 5.6 2011-06-06 5
Not in Italy yet but already loving this app,setting up all my restaurants for Venice,Florence,and Rome
Version 5.7 2011-06-27 5
Love it. Lives up to the experience you expect from using the web site.
Version 5.8 2011-10-12 5
I've travel all over the world and the tripadvisor App is always by my side.
Version 8.1 2013-11-10 1
I love Trip Advisor, but this app is slow and very limited. 

For example, There is no option to view any of my past reviews and there's no indication that my newest review (while using the app) was successfully submitted. 

I do like the simple design for hotel and restaurant searches.

Think I'll stick with the online version.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-23 5
I use on all vacations and find it very helpful for finding restaurants.
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 5
I love this app. Good job trip advisor. The best place to go if you want to know about any location.
Version 6.6 2013-05-17 5
It has provided very good information while traveling.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-01 4
It's a good version of the website. It's not great for stuff in the U.S. but it's great for international advice, and it's an easier platform to post reviews than yelp.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-18 5
Great app when traveling. Helpful in finding great places to eat. Easy to use.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-01 4
Pretty cool app! Helps me search for things to do before wherever I'm going instead of looking lost and hopeless when I arrive
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
Great prices and useful information- A necessity when traveling!
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Great service, good rates. Restaurant staff nice and friendly. Conveniently located near the freeway and airport.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 3
Would be five stars except that there is no portrait mode on the iPad!  Very silly to be forced into landscape mode for the forums.  You can only see a few entries at a time.
Version 8.4 2014-02-02 2
I can't edit my profile with the app, or on my mobile at all! This is very frustrating because I don't get online any other way. I would love to change my profile pic and add some photos to my reviews, but looks like I'm out of luck!!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-11 5
The fastest way to get all information about a restaurant, hotel or POI.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-23 3
This app is only good for very basic Trip Advisor functionality. Beyond looking up various locations, it can't do much else. Can't even figure out how to post a review from it.
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
Always a loyal trip advisor user on the net. Now I have the convenience to use it on my phone. Great app!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
The update/redesign has made this app sooooo much harder to use. Really miss the old view that allowed you to see prices across multiple vendors on one screen (Orbitz, Venere, etc.). Now you have to search prices one by one. Hate having a view of only 10 hotels at a time too. Please, bring back the old version!!!!!
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 5
Best app for travelers anywhere
Version 6.4 2012-08-22 5
Trip Advisor is one of the best travelers guide nowadays. Having it in ur pocket is even better!
Version 8.5 2014-02-27 3
But where is the preference panel to see all your past reviews? I feel like there is a whole layer missing from this app. Account manipulation is very limited.
Version 5.8 2011-10-25 5
I find the forums and travel tips very helpful.  it's the "go to" application for travelers!
Version 6.0 2012-03-22 5
Great reviews on hotels and attractions! Never travel without checking TA first
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 5
This is my most trusted and used app when planning for a trip or vacation!
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
Very helpful in browsing our vacation options.
Version 5.6 2011-06-25 5
I don't set a pinky toe in a hotel or most restaurants before checking trip advisor.
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
Intuitive, valuable, and essential for travellers with an iPad.
Version 5.9 2011-12-14 5
We travel a lot and I depend in Trip Advisors reviews to help us enjoy our meals on the road. Thank you!
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 5

Version 6.4 2012-08-20 5
I never plan a trip without first consulting trip advisor!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-24 2
I love trip advisor, but unfortunately, the iPad app is sub par. You cannot see it in portrait view (it's locked in landscape). The options are very limited... Better to pull it up on the web and bypass the app. Too many apps out there, guys, need to step it up!
Version 5.5 2011-05-05 5
Just like the website, but a portable ap you can use quickly  on trips
Version 5.8 2011-10-15 4
This app helped me find a hotel in a matter of minutes instead of taking forever to call every place to find availability. And it's free!
Version 5.9 2012-01-04 4
I have always trusted Trip Advisor for places to eat see and sleep. It's to bad when people "fluff" up places for better scoring. Let's be honest everyone!!!
Version 6.3 2012-07-16 5
I downloaded this app for a trip to orlando fla.  It gave me 11 great activities to check out.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 3
It's just an ok app.  It can't replace the ease of tripadvisor on my laptop. Tripadvisor is a wonderful website worthy of 5 stars, but this app is only ok.  If I had the choice I would just use the website.
Version 5.7 2011-07-22 5
It's easy and convenient. I think map feature is very helpful in finding a hotel.
Version 6.6 2012-10-22 5
It can give me some suggestion when I go to a place. Wonderful@
Version 5.9 2011-12-04 5
Gives us a great idea of what to expect when exploring new places

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-19 4

It would be nice if there was accessibility info listed and a filter for that. It's very difficult to travel with special needs and that information is really important to have on a travel app
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-05 5
New version, works fine now. Great app.
Version 5.6 2011-05-20 5

Very helpful for home and travel. Extremely grateful for this app!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 3
I like the app, but it won't let you click on links in posts on the forum.  I find that it's easier to just use the website where links are clickable.
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 5
So easy to search the vacation spots and whereabouts of where to go for an enjoyable vacation!
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 5
Just as helpful as website but more convenient.
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 5

Version 6.3 2012-08-05 4
Other than some wrong locations it has been very helpful.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
This is the best application to look for helpful reviews and find the perfect spot not to miss on a trip. It's a gem.

Version 5.7 2011-10-01 5
Tripadvisor is a reliable source of information.  We truly rely on it for most of our travels.
Version 5.8 2011-10-15 4
Always nice to see photos and reviews of a restaurant or attraction before you decide to go there, and Trip Advisor is probably my favorite source.

Great app, but I don't understand why you can't sign in with your online user ID. I can't access my saves on the iPhone if I saves them on the iPad!
Version 5.4 2011-06-15 5
When I travel I saw this application!! Here you can find the best restaurants, hotels !! Enjoy it
Version 5.8 2011-09-10 4

This is always the first place I go when planning a trip. It never disappoints.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 1
What have they done in this update?nothing works right anymore. The format is not user ready. Favorite are harder to get to by city. Then when you click on an entry in your favorites you get thrown out sort order and have to start over. This is my go to travel app, please fix this app!  This was NOT an improvement!
Version 8.5 2014-03-03 5
Trip advisor is a wonderful tool before traveling.

This is a great app. I use it to plan restaurants an anything on a future trip. I trust the reviews and base my trips on them!

Great way to find out what's good and then to tell others what you feel. Also great way for business to get out there and serve the public better.

The pictures tell all and what people write is awesome....besides funny sometimes.  Love the app it helps alot  :)
Version 6.1 2012-05-10 5

Version 6.5 2012-09-27 5
I have used trip advisor for our trips to Italy, Greece, Puerto Rico...hasn't failed me yet!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-22 2
This app really stops you from informing the public about places immediately.  It is not a good thing. It is not up to date  with information but they only want you to report on the information tripadvisor has from over 2 years ago
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-26 5
So glad there is an app for Tripadvisor!    I love the PC version and an app just puts icing on the cake!

Version 5.5 2011-04-23 4

Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
Well integrated with mobile sites for seamless travel research experience
Version 6.1 2012-04-04 5
Gotta use this every time going anywhere.
Version 6.1 2012-05-06 5
I use this app on my phone every time we vacation and we vacation about 8 times a year. :)
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 5
Been waiting for TA to have an app. Kudos to them for making it free. It's just what I need.

I recommend this app to people who like to travel. Highly useful app to know how hotels are and in what kind of condition they are in!

Been using trip advisor for years when debating on hotels and restaurants. Honest open opinions, and most seem accurate.  Thanks TA
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 4
The only thing I'd add would be a flea market finder! Everything else is very helpful, especially the 'near me now' feature.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5
I always review hotels when traveling this app makes it so much easier to rate on the go.
Version 6.2 2012-07-16 5

I have been using trip advisor to monitor flight.  Does exactly what I need.
Version 6.1 2012-04-10 4
I love this app. The only improvement I would recommend would be a weather link with current conditions and average temps
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
Used continually to see pictures and opinions of hotels and sites to see!
Version 6.6 2012-09-30 5
The 'near me' option is exactly what i wanted when i visit some place. Nice app
Version 6.6 2013-02-28 5
Very helpful! As a couple currently backpacking Europe it is a lifesaver!
Version 5.92 2012-01-24 4
I always check trip advisor before planning my trips and haven't been disappointed! Very helpful!!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-28 3
The map/directions are completely unreliable. Sometimes it is hard to find a specific restaurant when you know the type of food but not the name.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
I really love this app abd i always use it when i decide to have a trip any where and any time
Version 5.6 2011-05-27 4
Just started using this, great way to search when not at a computer.  Makes me feel like I might forego the travel book.
Version 5.9 2011-12-17 5
It's easy to use and the best resource for the good and the bad when it comes to traveling worldwide!
Version 5.92 2012-02-21 4
All my good saves,best deals and trips were because of you letting me know what was going on at the perfect time!!

Extremely helpful. Especially when you are in an unfamiliar town.
Version 6.3 2012-07-18 4
Trip Advisor is very helpful while traveling.  Helps us to find what we need to know for any area in which we travel.
Version 5.5 2011-05-03 3
I like this application for food/restaurant recommendations but I have written a couple reviews and so far, they have not been published. So, I am not sure this review-type app keeps up-to-date.
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 5
I go over the site always and having an app for mobile is more than great
Version 5.8 2011-09-05 5
I load this App to find hotel in Phuket, Thailand for my friend. Love it!!!!!! Will use for my next vacation.
Version 5.93 2012-03-11 5
I travel a lot and have learned to depend on TA when I make my choices for food it's really great!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-20 4
Use not just for reviews, but sort of gps as well.  Need to take reviews from the source, folks see things differently.
Version 5.7 2011-07-26 4
works well and seems to be brimming with plenty of accurate data
Version 5.8 2011-09-27 5
Love trip advisor. Makes life so much easier all in your fingertip.
Version 5.9 2011-12-01 5
Love that it finds where you are and finds what's around you!
Version 6.6 2013-03-31 3
At times frustrating to try to navigate to check rates. Especially when you are trying to view discounts between different categories (AARP, Senior, Government....)
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
Very helpful and informative for both stateside and overseas.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-07 3

Version 5.7 2011-07-09 4
Really like this app, only thing it's missing is the ability to share, em or text, info, directions,etc.  Please add this function and it's 5 stars!
Version 6.6 2012-10-28 2
For some reason, I just cannot find anything in this app. Its standard response for all searches is "No results found". For now, I keep writing my reviews using the browser, where I can find everything.
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 5
I love being able to get reviews and travel info right from my iPad
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 5
I've been to Europe before but this app put me in touch with so many other options
Version 6.0 2012-03-24 5
No question this is the best app on the iPad. The near me now function is excellent
Version 6.4 2012-09-10 4
Despite the obvious drawbacks inherent anytime the tested population is very limited, as it sometimes is, TA is consistently dependable.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-27 4
I love finding new places even if its in my own city. This is a great app and gives me reviews which matter a lot to me.  Get it you won't regret it!
Version 6.1 2012-04-23 5
Excellent media for feedback and researching new destinations.
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 2
Nothing special just like all others and it has glitches. For em ample I tried re input a new destination and it kept giving the same info for my last inquisition ... Oh well just have to turn phone of to reset app..still an inconvenience that I hate
Version 6.6 2013-01-13 5
TripAdvisor is like a toothbrush, I don't travel without it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 2
The upgrade to this recent app has created many hiccups. Makes is difficult and frustrating to use. Freezes often or won't respond. Not user friendly and annoying to try to get to your "saves" and other information.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 3
I like Trip Advisor, but their app is slow and feels buggy.
If you have the patience to navigate through its, um, "quirks," then you can get to their good info.
Version 5.7 2011-06-26 5
Would be even better if there was a possibility to filter hotels by rooms availability.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
Hard to imagine traveling without TA app - love the "restaurants near you" feature!!
Version 5.9 2011-11-25 5
Trip advisor is extremely helpful! Will use it for every trip from here on out!
Version 5.93 2012-02-28 5
My go to source for local attractions and reviews

All the features of the excellent website in a convenient mobile form.
Version 6.1 2012-05-14 5
Trip Advisor is my go to app when I am planning a trip.  Love the forums and all the reviews.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-11 5
Very helpful when planning my vacation!
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
I would never consider traveling without first consulting Trip Advisor!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-29 5
Love trip advisor, everything you need to know as a tourist in one easy to use app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-23 5
Very nice and useful app. You must have it if you are for the first time in NY !
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 2
We often use Trip Advisor on vacation, so the app seemed like a natural. So far I am finding it difficult to find and read reviews - much less functional than the Web site. Even accounting for the format difference, this app just isn't worth the headache.
Version 6.1 2012-05-25 5
Great app!  Very easy to use.   Really handy when you're in an unfamiliar city.  Instant research in the palm of your hand.  Love it!
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 4
I find this app very valuable and helpful in locating hotels and places of interest. The ratings are ver useful.
Version 5.6 2011-06-22 5
This App found places which dies not normally show up in other search engines...
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 4
Im always on the go, sometimes on short notice.  With this app, I can quickly plan or change a "last minute" trip w no problem.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
I love this app. I've learn more about my city and activities to do. Best of all it helps me plan trips close to home.
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 5
What can I say... for those of us who travel, this is a life & trip saver. I don't leave home without it ;-)
Version 5.7 2011-07-06 5
Made our vacation very easy to plan! Highly recommend it
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
The only thing that could make this app better is to have more reviews for a more complete database
Version 6.0 2012-03-14 4
Love the app and love it more since the update. Just doesn't rotate with my screen and only gives you horizontal view option.
Version 6.6 2012-11-11 3
The app seems pretty cool, but it is so painfully slow I just can't use it. I click buttons and links and nothing happens. If I could actually use the app, I think I would enjoy it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-10 3
Please fix the app so you can navigate to and from forum topics with a "back" button. This is highly annoying and was easy to do in the previous version.
Version 8.5 2014-02-26 5
I love being able to know where to go and where not to go.
Version 5.8 2011-09-05 5
Helps planning local getaways as well as far far away destinations.  Use it a lot.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
I love having trip advisor app on my iPad !  Its too easy to plan my trips!  Never get off the couch!
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 3
Overall TripAdvisor is still helpful, but I'm very disappointed in the app update! I lost all my old saves and find it much less user-friendly. Wish I could go back to the old app.
Version 6.1 2012-06-04 5
This is really useful and user friendly, easy to find everything
Version 6.5 2012-09-28 5
I have learned to trust the reviews. They are right 99% of the time
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 5
Honest opinions from visitors everywhere!
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
We have planning a trip to California this summer, and this site is great! Invaluable in planning.
Version 6.1 2012-05-23 5
Photos could be a bit more responsive though
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
Second everybody opinion about this app ,very good ,informative and good tips

Thanks
Version 6.6 2012-11-22 5
Very helpful. I have gone to places that I would never find in a regular guide
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-02 2
Works well enough. There are two big issues:

1)Add a portrait view mode. Reading landscape is often awkward on the ipad. 

2) Please add ability to email links of what you're viewing.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-18 5
I love the new design and all other options. It's so smart so great !!
Version 8.5 2014-03-27 4
The reviews give you a good idea of what to expect. Though we have have found great deals on hotels that are not on this app.
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5
Great app, easy to navigate -- get it!  I wouldn't consider planning a trip without consulting Trip Advisor.
Version 5.8 2011-10-29 5
Great app!!  Love the functionality and maneuverability within the app!
Version 6.1 2012-06-21 5
I don't remember how I got by without Tripadvisor before!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-01 5
Already addicted to the easy interface and concise, appropriate info.
Good job!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 4
This is a great app for iPad! I'm in Vienna right now. Just took the train from Prague.  Talked to a woman who said this site is like her Bible.  Still figuring out how to use it, but I'm sure I will.
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 5
Never been steered in the wrong direction. Other traveler's pictures are really valuable!!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-22 5
Easy to use app.  Navigation is straight forward.  Finds places with ease

I use trip advisor whenever and wherever I travel.  Great information and easy to use.
Version 6.6 2012-12-02 4
Perfect app for a road trip where you have no idea where anything is. Also a great tool for finding new spots where you live.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-21 1
Viewing photos of a hotel is 90% of the value of this app to me. Right now the photo browsing does not work right. I don't even want to do more searching because I know I will not be able to see photos when I find a hotel.

I'll change my rating when they fix the photo browsing.
Version 8.5 2014-03-02 5
Great site - always ready when we need it
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-23 3
Works well and does what it says but I wish the app provided website links for each place. Also, I would like to be able to see menus for restaurants.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-23 3

Version 8.1 2013-11-11 5
Great app anywhere, I go I can read other options. Before I make up my own.
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 4
trip advisor is becoming a must-have app. the reviews guide me to restaurants, attractions and hotels. owners pay attention to what is written here. Get it.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 4
So helpful when it came to researching new places. I wish the app had a send to friend option/etc but oh well.  Great informative app nonetheless.
Version 5.9 2011-12-20 5

Initial green screen appears, then closes and that's it. Tried deleting reinstalling, turning phone off, reinstalling.  No helpful info or help on App Store page or on Tripadvisor web page. Used main website via browser while traveling this weekend, but not as travel/iphone friendly.

Version 6.6 2012-10-14 3
The app is too laggy to have any benefit over the website- I find I double click b/c the first click doesn't seem to register, only then skip a page.

I think everyone medes to know about trip adviser, belos a lot!

Version 6.5 2012-09-22 2
This app has nice information and works for hotels. But you can't switch from viewing hotels to viewing Things To Do without the app changing the city all of a sudden. The Things to Do suddenly disappear. Not helpful at all.
Version 6.6 2012-09-28 4
I found myself getting stuck into a loop of being asked to write a review, then add a photo, and then review again,

I'd find this app a lot more useful if restaurants could be saved for offline viewing. The European restaurant reviews are great when traveling, but I'd need a data plan to view them abroad.

Not the best site for searching prices for hotels, but the best when it comes to reviews

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 1
... and yet so far. I'm giving it 1-star to show how disappointed I am.

I'm searching for hotels. It won't let me filter those out that are not available. So for each and every hotel, I have to tap, tap, tap, tap; find out it is booked; then back, back, back, back. Rinse, lather, repeat. Very frustrating.

Love this app but don't like the changes on the iPhone app....used to be able to filter by top rated & distance but no more; please fix this!!!!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 5
Great App. Easy to use with useful information when planning a vacation.
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
Great app. I used it both on my iPhone and iPad !
Version 5.92 2012-01-27 5
Use it everyday (on the road) to find new restaurants.  Not sure how to add new restaurants, not in the TripAdvisor database.
Version 6.1 2012-05-08 5
Very helpful. I should have used it more on our recent trip.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
I always use tripadvisor for the reviews and was never disappointed.
Version 6.4 2012-09-01 5
I love looking at places to go and things to do. It's good to see what people think who have been there
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 3
The app should automatically go to nearest places when submitting a review. Also it should not have a min text limit of 200 characters so I don't wear out my thumb.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-20 5
Easy and simple to use to get insightful information on locales.
Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5
Everything you need to research your vacation at you fingertips.
Version 5.92 2012-02-22 2
I always use TripAdvisor when traveling. There are some bugs that need to be worked out when using the map. I don't like how it doesn't show you where something is on a map, just the information about the restaurant/activity/hotel.
Version 5.5 2011-04-15 5
First place to go to find any destination information fast, easy, reliable.
Version 5.8 2011-10-04 4
A tiny bit cumbersome maneuvering the app, but eventually all info is there to access.
Version 6.1 2012-04-11 3
In my mind, version 6.1 does not represent a "better" version of the app. Pictures of restaurant do not appear as well. The bing map system is really worthless and is a downgrade from google maps.
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 5
Has everything in one app. Other apps just don't have all the details I needed.
Version 6.4 2012-08-23 5
Helped out a lot in my planning my trip to Hawaii and looking for the best beaches!

Very nice! Got hotel indications from it and I'm very happy!
I'll be a new contributor to it. The more people we have imputing their opinions the better it will be!
Version 6.2 2012-07-10 5
Not sure why I can only view it sideways but the app is pretty legit.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
It's like having a guide with you the whole time. A must have!!!
Version 6.6 2012-09-30 2
When scrolling through reviews of an establishment, the listings lag every crew seconds, annoying enough that I find myself having to use the website instead of the app.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5
We use it all the time, even in places we know just to jog our memory.

The woman at the front desk is the sh*#!  She was very informative and interesting.  The bay model seems to be pretty cool, for someone who is not particularly interested in this form of science it was still cool to come see for it's significance.

We travel a lot and use tripadvisor mobile all the time, relying on it especially for restaurant recommendations
Version 5.9 2012-01-13 4

Trip advisor is very easy to use. It is like having an honest outspoken friend on hand 24/7.
Version 6.2 2012-07-05 5
I highly recommend this.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 4
This is great for planning! I just wish it had a way of searching for other types of places nearby like garden centers.
Version 5.9 2012-01-16 4
Absolutely love Trip Advisor, what a time saver! It's accurate, precise and very efficient! What more could you ask for? KUDOS...
Version 6.1 2012-06-17 5
Always refer to TropAdvisor before I book a stay ANYWHERE!  <3 this ap!
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 4
I always check out hotels and restraints on trip advisor.
Version 6.5 2012-09-17 5
Pretty awesome app. Very helpful. Consistent with others like Yelp and Urbanspoon.
Version 6.6 2012-11-03 5
I'm on my way to being a top contributor & lovin' it! Bravo, Trip Advisor. You got me hooked :)
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
Only downside is the hours that disappear searching and dreaming.
Version 6.1 2012-05-23 4
Great app companion for the web site. Handy on the road or on the go but not so much in leaving reviews with app.
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 5
Helps me find great places for various budgets
Version 6.4 2012-09-10 5
A great guide to let you know before you know.

Wonderful app that is straight forward and easy to use!

This app is awesome. Everything is in one place and you can say your favorites! Love it!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
Just found out about this web site and it is great. Big help with hotels.
Version 5.92 2012-02-16 3
Great app, except I get weird results when I click on Check Rates. It would be nice if the app could remember the last city searched. 
I really like the travelers tips and photos. Very helpful!
Version 5.9 2011-12-18 5
This is an essential app if you are planning a trip. A great and reliable tool
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 5
Very very useful, traveling thru Switzerland and France and this app is my best advisor :)
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 5
It helps you find good restaurants in unfamiliar places.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-17 2
This app has been around for years but is still plagued by basic usability flaws. I search for restaurants, then select a town, but then I can't look for restaurants outside that town.  Close the app, still can't do it. Software 101.
Version 5.7 2011-07-06 5
Just like the website. Very helpful and well laid out.
Version 5.92 2012-02-15 5
What an app.  When I wanna do something different, I press and see!  Don't know how one lives without this app.
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 4
I would like to be able to save places for viewing offline (I don't always have 3G or wifi while traveling)
Version 6.6 2012-10-15 5
It does everything I want -- just recommended it to a friend :)
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-21 3
Great for researching trip to Paris from the states.  But once there, relied on yelp and google maps much more because they were more versatile, reliable and easier to use.
Version 8.2 2013-12-08 5
This app is awesome!! I use it for everything. Don't know what I would do without it. Love It!!!!
Version 5.5 2011-05-02 5
Easy to navigate and find reviews. It is just what it should be. Thanks Tripadvisor.
Version 5.7 2011-06-25 5
Have been very pleased with accurate info provided with this app
Version 5.8 2011-08-13 5
Love this app.  It can find great things that might be hidden right around the corner!
Version 5.92 2012-02-26 5
We always use the website, and this app is amazing!
Version 6.5 2012-09-15 3
I'd like the option to add photos before submitting review also I lost myfirst review because the app closed in me.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-31 3
Haven't really used it. But I do look up things and have had good information provided.
It's a nice app to have for doing quick look ups of flights of things to do.
Version 8.2 2013-12-18 5
I like it and I like reviewing things and reading them so it's cool
Version 8.3 2013-12-29 5
I plan nothing without it!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-23 5
It is easy to browse places and everything... Love this!
Version 5.92 2012-01-26 5
Easy to use. Very helpful if you have a dog and need to find a decent pet friendly hotel.
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 5
Can always count on it for reliable tips and reviews!
Version 6.6 2012-12-23 5
Trip advisor is great when I am treading into new territory.   I like the reviews.
Version 6.6 2013-03-25 5
Great app; easy to search and I love the save option for things you like!
Version 8.2 2013-12-04 2
Have been a long time pleased user of the app.
However, the latest update caused concern. Selecting a 5 star hotel's "pricing" sent me instead to photos of rooms and bathrooms. Selecting "hotel website" resulted in a map display. Good grief.
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 3
It could be five star but when we search for food nearby it shows a lot of random things like deja vu and the body shop? Over all 3 stars it's good enough but could be better
Version 5.5 2011-08-07 4
Always find the best prices, very helpful reviews! 

Only thing I'd like to see added is a search by distance tab!
Version 5.3 2011-08-09 5
App is very useful and runs well. I've used it for planning several trips so far.
Version 5.9 2011-11-27 5
I'm a TA fanatic and was pumped to get the app. Very handy and we used it frequently in costa rica
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
This app really easy to use. Looking forward in using it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
I love trip advisor!! Be it reading reviews or writing reviews myself! I'm totally hooked!!! It's spot on!! Love it!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 5
Everything I need reviews, pictures and travel links
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Love this app. So easy to use and full of good travel info. It's my first "go to" travel app.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 3
I like the app but like the website better.  Maybe I just need to know how to find things on here but it seems like it keeps bringing me back to my home instead of the last place I was researching.
Version 5.8 2011-12-07 5
Have been using tripadvisor to plan vacations for years. App is great
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Works great, is a little slow but has great information.
Version 6.2 2012-07-18 5
Awesome site. Great for short stays close by to long vacations, restaurants, etc.
Version 6.6 2012-12-01 5
Helps me find restaurantsI didnt even know was there..
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 1
Looks like the new version of the app doesn't have anymore map view for things to do. It was the most useful feature for me for planning little trips around me. The map that when moved updated recommendations with things to do is now missing.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-16 5
I use this app all of the time for reviews. I would be lost without it!
Version 5.7 2011-08-18 5
My choice for travel information. The best information at your fingertips. Trust it!
Version 5.8 2011-10-08 5
This app rocks!! Cuts the time in half, no more guessing nor looking around !! 
Thank you guys!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-18 5
The first app I open when I'm traveling and need To find something.
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 4
Very easy to use and has great functionality. Haven't booked anything yet but is full of goodies at your beckon call.
Version 5.92 2012-02-04 5
Excellent! So helpful for planning our Australia & New Zealand trip! Couldn't have planned it without it!!!
Version 5.9 2012-02-15 5
Great app, very user friendly..don't leave home without this!
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 5
Use this whenever I travel and have found some great restaurants
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
Great tool for quick comparison snapshot of competing DMOs.
Version 6.6 2012-10-20 2
I can understand having to sign in if I were making a comment. But having to sign in to access "saves" is completely ridiculous. In that case your Ap shouldn't even allow me to save something in the first place.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
It is my go to app. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to travel.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 5
I use it everytime I travel. I don't go anywhere without checking trip advisor 1st!!!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Just starting to use the app. It's fast, contains lots of info , and easy to use.
Version 6.3 2012-07-19 5
Love this app, research all my trips on it before booking
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-25 1
Used to love TripAdvisor, told all my friends about it.. Useless now. No web links to view restaurant menus ?? Why bother ?? How fun is it to see a list of 300 places to eat when you have to Google for a menu?   Hard to find web links to anything... Want to know more about a museum? Be prepared to Google
Version 6.2 2012-08-11 5
Love this app for my iPad. Links to Maps, which is very convenient.
Version 7.0.1 2013-08-25 5
Very useful and pertinent info.   Will be using in the future
Version 5.6 2011-07-19 5
I always consult trip adviser first, it hasn't steered me wrong yet.
Version 5.8 2011-10-04 5
Trip advisor has saved my behind on more occasions than I can count!
Version 6.1 2012-05-10 5
Great information which is very easy to access.
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 4
This app is very helpful! Love having it to be able to plan my next trip or pick somewhere local to go!
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
True lifesaver when planning dates!
Version 8.4 2014-02-03 5
My favorite app! Love checking it for reviews!
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 5
Don't leave home without trip advisor. Just made dinner res in athens. Efkharisto para poli!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
This app made my trip to Thailand much easier....and helped me save some $ also. Thanks!
Version 7.0 2013-05-02 4
TripAdvisor is the best at assisting me with what hotels and restaurants I should use.  When in doubt, I look at others's reviews to determine if I should go.
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
This is a really great app for whatever it is you are looking for where ever you may be.  Great job!
Version 5.6 2011-06-25 5
I love this app. I'd much rather see what my fellow travelers have to say instead of the advertisers.
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 5
I've used TripAdvisor for years, and love the app on my iPad! I highly recommend it!
Version 6.1 2012-07-09 4
I like this site better than Yelp. Seems more practical and serious. I'm a fairly frequent reviewer.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-23 5
I rely on this app heavily whoever traveling to new areas!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 3
Easy to navigate and responds well to actions indicated by users.

Perhaps over simplified but more impressive is the GPS element, a nicer attribute that the website lacks.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 5
Used the app while traveling in Europe to find hotels and places to eat. Worked great
Version 5.8 2011-09-24 5
A must app for all your short and long trips within US :)
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5
Love it!  Makes finding things to do and places to stay and eat easy!
Version 8.4 2014-02-02 4
I love checking out places before I go and writing reviews after. This app makes it easy and fun!
Version 5.7 2011-08-01 4
Love the app all over, however I miss the Facebook login as it's always been a good addition
Version 6.1 2012-07-12 5
Quick and easy on the iPad and iPhone - love it!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-11 4
Wonderful app and website. I would just suggest that a handicapped section be added. That would be great!
Version 8.2 2013-12-06 5
We use Trip Advisor all the time and love it. This is a very easy to use, helpful app.
Version 8.4 2014-02-02 5
I love that I get to read and review places from the customers point of view.
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 1
did not find the restaurant I was looking for and offered no way to submit it. starts sending me email I don't want and can't find out how to turn off notifications. the web access found more restaurants than the dedicated app, and ad more features for narrowing searches. seems like waste to install the app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-22 4
TripAdvisor is informative, organized, and well executed. My new go-to travel site.
Version 6.1 2012-07-29 1
It is impossible to look for things nearby, or to research a specific destination. Once you are at a city and you would like to look for a certain restaurant it reverts back to a worldwide search. It does this with anything you can think of.
Google still has this beat.
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 5
Can't book a trip without going through trip advisor!!! Ty!
Version 6.6 2012-12-12 5
Just like using the website on my computer, PC or Mac
Version 6.6 2013-01-10 5
Easy and very convenient for those who love travelling like me. No regret using it..
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 4
Maybe I'm missing it but I was hoping there would be a map view of the list
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 4
This is worth getting, much smoother navigation than vs. Safari. If they integrate Direction functionality it will be a 5 star travel app.
Version 6.0 2012-03-14 5
I have used this website for booking hotels in the past.  I am so glad it is now an iPad app as well.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
A must have for tourism. Excellent reviews of many of the different amenities.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-16 4
Keep my last place searched as the first thing I see when I go back to the app.
Version 8.2 2014-03-24 5
I am travelling in middle east and this app is life saver when it comesto find restaurants
Version 6.4 2012-08-22 4
Very useful. Wish it could save to an account and easily find something I found on a different device.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-20 5
Convenient, and easy to use. Great resource while you're out and about!!!
Version 5.5 2011-05-03 5

Version 5.8 2011-08-31 5
great app! i used it many times and always satisfied with the recommendations
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 4
It is a great app. I should have discovered it sooner, use it when traveling far away or too near by cities!
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 4
This app is user friendly. Easy to navigate & set up favorites & compare places. Also great to see what else is happening in the area.
Version 5.93 2012-03-05 4
I travel often for business and I am new to the region.

This app has made travel much easier for me...thanks.
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 5
This app is really helpful for when you are traveling!
Version 6.6 2012-12-22 4
A strength of the desktop version is the ability to segregate comments by service parameter.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-31 4
This version is a lot friendlier and gives very televant info.
Version 5.6 2011-06-24 5
We are going on a extended USA/Canada trip. Trip Adviser is three travel guides in a iPad. A pleasant surprise at every turn.
Version 5.92 2012-01-20 5
Want to be really well oriented? This is the site!!! You can delete all other apps right now - trust me!!!
Version 6.2 2012-06-13 5
When ever I plan a get away I come here first

Great app with some really good info! I will be using this to plan my next trip!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-29 4
O there's something about a man in black makes me wanna buy a Cadillac
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 3
Can't find the features I like best- search by ranking, clicking on city after in review, etc. please change update.
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 4
Used the app in my last trip to a favorite city and found places to see that most forget.  Also helped me find the eateries that I love most.
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 4
Useful in researching destinations that I haven't visited before. It will get even better as more users leave reviews and ratings.
Version 6.0 2012-03-16 5
Not sure I like the required landscape screen, but the app is solid!
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-02 5
The best travel site for planning your stay.  Good reviews by serious travelers.
Version 5.8 2011-10-04 4
Always helpful even in remote outposts!
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
Thank you for this great app , has reviews and pictures!! Fun app to Find new places to have fun :)
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 4
If you travel this is a must have, it has super useful information. Also it comes with cool maps and good interaction options.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-23 2
This place was recommended to us so we went. The Penny Tortellini had no taste & when we told the waitress Erica she responded "I'm sorry." We were still charged the full price & not offered anything differently. We would not recommend that dish. The eggplant Parmesan was good.
Version 8.3 2014-01-02 5
Perfect for looking for hotels, restaurants, etc when traveling. Awesome app!
Version 5.8 2011-09-24 5
I think if I did't have trip adviser my wife and would have been lost! Ha
Version 5.8 2011-09-26 4
Good to have. I don't know that I trust all of the reviews, but the facility to seek and find within the app is very good.
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 5
Try to read between all the different reviews to get a feel for a place
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 2
You cannot search based on the rating of the hotel, attraction, restaurant, etc. Gives you the map when you don't want it. I like the original version much better and I use it. I save my favorites on the app.
Version 6.6 2012-12-01 5
Everywhere I travel I use this app. One of the most useful ones I've got.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-25 5
It has really helped me during my trips so far.
Version 5.6 2011-06-13 5
Like checking out my options before I commit.

Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
Great app for travel (both business and pleasure).

I fine it helpful...in the US and abroad. Nice to have something instantly available to depend on.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-03 4
Great app, but viewing photos are a pain to get out of. It seems to stick after  touching the "Done" button. iPhone 4S.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-12 5
I love to use this APP whenever I'm looking for a place to stay or a place to eat!!
Version 5.5 2011-04-28 5
This is a great App and I cannot think of one negative.  I use it all the time and like it more than the website.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
This is one of my favorite iPad apps. User friendly and so much information.
Version 5.9 2011-11-30 5
I don't plan a trip without first checking with Trip Advisor!
Version 6.6 2013-04-15 4
They should have information about the place so you know the importance of it and what it is.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-01 4
No issues on the performance side with this app .. Like the UI and find it overall easy to navigate and handle .

Version 5.93 2012-03-04 4
Would be great if more pics could be imported from other sites, which tend to have lots more user content (e.g. yelp)
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 4

Annoyingly buggy at best. It's not very responsive when I hit the "cancel" button when Im looking at the pictures and the pop-up for push notifications comes up every time I open the app. Seriously, when I say "no" I mean no.
Version 5.93 2012-03-04 5
This has been a reliable, accurate app that we used to plan our vacation.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5

The new version is much neater and easier to use.
Version 5.8 2011-08-14 2
I looked and looked and see no way to do a three-Pt trip reservation. Flight from City A to City B, from B to C, from C back to A. Searched the forums, still no help. Guess I'll have to use some other app or website.
Version 6.1 2012-05-03 5
Very helpful and easy to navigate
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
Hasn't steered me wrong yet.  Use this app all the time when out of town...

It's a very handy app -- great to find things to do on the go and post reviews immediately.
Version 5.9 2011-12-02 5
I am a guy that won't plan a vacation.  This app gives me options on demand. Good work guys!
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
Very user interace friendly .. I totally recommend it
Version 1.0 2008-07-17 1
Wow,
I guess Bank of America and Trip Advisor are trying to beat each other to the podium to accept worst launch app for the iPhone. I can't speak to the terrible or incorrect information on restaurants because this app seems to think I am currently in New Jersey even though I'm currently in Texas. Um, ok. Don't install. Keep going.
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
I travel a lot, so have the ability to get advice on food and hotels is great.

Version 5.7 2011-07-12 4
Great source of information if you can wade through all the whiners and complainers ...
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-27 3
Looking for restaurants by area is a major pain - every time you pan or zoom the map, it changes all the letters. Landscape only on iPad = major fail!
Version 8.1 2013-11-13 4
It has the option to save things which I like about. Places to see, forums, places to eat.
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 4
A must have app for would be travelers! Gives you the tools you need to have great and safe vacation experience!
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 4
Always check reviews on hotels and restaurants before I spend my hard-earned money. Helpful and simple.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 4
The TripAdvisor app is very easy to use, clean design, and makes it more likely that I'll actually write a review.
Version 8.3 2013-12-29 5
Love this app.  It rarely crashes and is loaded with lots of great info for trip planning.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-13 5
Awesome for finding restaurants, bars, clubs, hotels, etc.

Version 5.7 2011-07-12 5
Great app especially if you are not sure where to eat or find attractions  in a new place
Version 5.93 2012-03-11 5
In a word outstanding. It's nice to have an assistant with you on the road at all times via the app!!
Version 6.2 2012-08-08 5
Has good recs for smaller towns and less traveled areas. My goto app for car travel.
Version 6.1 2012-05-08 3
I look at places I know and read the reviews and realise we ALL have an opinion so take it with a healthy grain of sea salt. Wish it was easier to ADD to places. You still have to decide for yourself but it helps.
Version 6.1 2012-04-30 5
Awesome app and tripadvisor rocks. We never plan our outings without TA handy!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-29 5
I have used this for vacations to Paris, Miami, and Cape Cod.  Always find fun things to do and good food.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-22 5
This is a good app and use it all the time throughout my busy traveling.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-03 4
Great apt! Check before doing any traveling. Downside is it will not allow you to write reviews

Version 5.8 2011-08-19 5
This app made our family vacation perfect!
Version 5.92 2012-02-06 5

Version 5.92 2012-03-07 5
What a great full featured app. I will download anything from this in the future. Great work
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
Love the fact that the ratings are from actual travellers like me and not 'experts'
Version 6.6 2013-02-17 5
I love this app! It's great to read real reviews of hotels, restaurants, etc.

Very helpful while on my Florence and Rome visit.
Version 5.6 2011-06-24 5
Puts everything at your fingertips.
Version 5.8 2011-10-19 4
Stops working and closes if there is no Internet connection. Really annoying in places with weak signal...
Version 5.9 2011-11-24 4
This app is very useful. I use Trip Advisor for all things travel. There is one drawback though. It's slow at times, but what app isn't? I LOVE THIS APP!!!!
Version 6.6 2012-10-31 4
Very easy, the interface is marvelous. And I like how it helps me consider a hotel or restaurant I need.
Version 5.0.1 2010-07-03 3
If you need a hotel or something to do in a pinch this app is fine, but with no photos it's pretty useless for planning any type of vacation. I'd just use yelp instead. Give me photos and I'll be a happy user.
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 4
Agree with other posters. Has potentail but is missing some nice to have features.  This and yelp go good together.
Version 5.8 2011-09-04 5
Excellent resource, however, the owners of the hotels and restaurants shouldn't be allowed to rate themselves.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
Very useful to plan travel and while traveling too!
Version 6.6 2013-04-05 5
Love the website ...now love the app.... Very handy and very stable ... A must have for the avid traveller.

Great way to vent, recommend, and find someplace to eat or stay. Don't expect it to solve everything for you and it is great as a tool.

I cancelled my account because TA censored my reviews and pictures, while letting obviously bogus reviews push places to a #1 rating. I found the app crude and that the web browser site worked smoother on the iPad.

Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
I use this often when looking for hotels and/ or activities.
Version 6.6 2013-02-14 1
I much prefer the web page.   Without wanting to struggle through apps I have found my self going to the web page rather than stay with the app.  I like trip advisor enough that I will continue to try and use the app.  I hope it gets as easy to explore with as their explorer version
Version 5.6 2011-07-02 5
This is the perfect app for going on trips you'll find everything you need right at your finger tips... Love it
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 4
Try to find info on flights from Calafate

Anything you want to do or go Trip have it. Easy to use. Reviews well made
Version 8.3 2014-01-21 4
I use both a lot, but prefer the app for searching a city for attractions.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
I use it for planning and then every day on trip.

I found the app immensely useful while traveling in Rome.

Good user interface, intuitive.   Excellent job and easy to use
Version 6.0 2012-03-13 1
I don't know what they were thinking with this update. App only works in Landscape view, freezes and crashes, tells me there are 54 hotels but will only show 2. Can no longer list by ratings. Someone needs to remember , "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Oops, too late, now its broke, go back and fix it!
Version 6.0 2012-03-30 5
Don't book travel without it!
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
This is the way apps should work.
Version 6.2 2012-06-12 5
Love it! Always with me when I travel - won't disappoint you! Good job!!
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 4
I like it a lot and I use it a lot especially when abroad. Just need to be able to add locations not present in Tripadvisor.
Version 5.8 2011-09-12 4
Use this app! Valuable Insights to consider your options before traveling or on the fly.
Version 5.93 2012-03-07 5
Loved tripadvisor before now that I have my IPhone I use this all the time.

Version 6.6 2012-11-12 5
Never leave home without it!

Easy to use, GPS is fairly accurate.  Wish there were more restaurants or a way to add my own that I've been to that aren't here.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
Don't leave home (or plan your trip) without it!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-25 5
I just have a trip from Arkansas to Los Angeles and trip adviser was soooooo useful
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-22 3
Wish this app is as good as the website as you can do better things on the web than this website. 
Makes it hard to search for things one wants using this app.  :(
Version 5.9 2011-10-30 5
Trip advisor is my go-to tool for researching for a vacation or weekend getaways.
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
5 * app! Everything you will need in one place to plan a great trip!
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
Great app! We have found a lot of great restaurants using this while traveling! Love it!!

Well laid-out, great to save different hotels etc.
Version 5.9 2011-12-04 5
Great app for finding local eats and things to do!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 4
Only downside is not being able to have access to your profile.
Version 6.1 2012-04-05 2
When I search for a location it doesn't show the places in order of ranking but rather based on a map location and if the item is inside the map window.  It doesn't show all the results.  The website is better than the app.
Version 6.1 2012-06-19 5
Thanks to trip advisor stuff,
We need this kind of programs in our iphons!
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 5

Version 6.6 2013-02-25 5
to get information on destinations during and ahead of the visit.
Version 8.1 2013-11-08 3
I tried to write a review on a restaurant, and the app kept asking me to sign in with Facebook, which I did several times. It never would let me submit the review.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-27 5
I love tripadvisor! Very useful. I use it all the time to review hotel/places that I want to go.
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
This App has saved me from making huge mistakes with Hotels. Awesome!!!

Another great user feedback app.  The more people use it the better it becomes.
Version 5.91 2012-01-15 5
Easy, quick and fun way to get info on the road.
Version 5.93 2012-02-25 4
The website is brilliant. I don't travel without it. But the app -- especially the interactive map -- needs work.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 5
Like to be able to find reviews close to me
Version 5.92 2012-02-01 5

Makes travel so much easier. I've used it on vacation for last minute plans!
Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5
Simply the easiest travel app to research your destination!
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 1
scrolling is slow even with new iphone.
your search result is not retained after navigating a selection. 
switching between tabs sometime takes longer than usual.
descriptions of place can't hardly be seen. 

overall, not great experience
Version 6.6 2013-06-24 5
I've been using trip advisor for years, and love this porting to iPad.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
The app really helped us navigate where to go - and what to avoid.
Version 5.6 2011-06-13 5
Tripe advisor is a big help when it came to going out to dinner at Bratta's Piano Bar &Ristorante
Version 5.8 2011-09-24 5
Super clean, easy to navigate interface and very useful. I'm impressed
Version 5.9 2012-01-05 5

Version 6.1 2013-05-16 5
I Foud it very helpful WEB Site that help me to do to my travel plan faster.

Version 5.5 2011-04-26 5
Awesome app for finding my next trip while my kids are at dance class :)

Always turn to tripadvisor first, app makes even easier. Love it!
Version 6.2 2012-07-13 4
It is an ok app.  It would be nice to be able to access my profile from the app to make necessary changes.
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 3
I don't like this app at all. You cannot open the place selected and be able to read any reviews or info about. So, what is it your meaning then? Just see a list? I don't like that.
Version 6.6 2012-12-01 2
TripAdvisor is good app, and was nice to use in planning trip.  However, when on iPhone and using in Paris, the maps portion of the app would not load and was useless.  Will not rely on this app on future trips.  Needs improvement.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-24 5
You find some really great values!
Version 8.2 2013-12-09 5
Can't travel without it
Version 8.2 2013-12-13 5
When in doubt check TA out...
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 4
The app is pretty good. But there are some options that are missing, like open a link in safari, or send a link to tripadvisor's page in email.
Version 5.8 2011-10-06 5
It is an awesome app which offers me great convenience to pick a hotel in my destinations.
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
Great app, easy to use and very accurate with regard to ratings.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
Awesome app & a must for travelers. Very easy app to navigate. Highly recommend !!!
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 3
This is better for those just planning their trip for them it is great.  But for some reason the mobile version does not state who I am other than member which doesn't help me in the forums.
Version 5.8 2011-09-27 5
I like it...easy to navigate and helpful in finding a decent restaurant in a new city
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 5

From booking flights to finding places to eat, this app does it!
Version 5.9 2011-12-01 4
I am alwys checking tripadviser before booking. Easy and complete app
Version 6.3 2012-08-01 5
TripAdvisor is great to use when planning a vacation.
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
Helpful since I travel and dine out often. This app is super easy to use!
Version 8.5 2014-03-20 4

Version 5.8 2011-09-23 5
This is the first site for reviews of places allover the world - never steered me wrong
Version 6.0 2012-03-15 5
The best app. It is very easy to use and comprehensive   If you travel you need this app
Version 6.2 2012-08-02 5
This app is a must if you ever go out of town and don't know what's around.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 5
So long as people keep keep providing reviews, it's a great resource!
Version 5.7 2011-07-12 5

Version 6.6 2013-02-17 5
Very helpful in finding out things to do!
Version 5.6 2011-06-09 5
Just as good as the web site. I use trip Advisor whenever looking at hotels or restaurants out of town.
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
New to traveling and this app makes looking for deals so easy!!!
Version 5.7 2011-06-30 5
I love this app! So glad I downloaded it! I highly recommend---this has been an awesome traveling tool.
Version 5.8 2011-08-27 5
Driving to Iowa I found this app n boy did it come in handy for places to visit n eat. Go get it!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5

Version 5.7 2011-08-01 5
Good way to check on places to stay before traveling...
Version 5.8 2011-10-25 4
Food, sights everything but bus routes. Would have been 5 stars with bus info.
Version 5.93 2012-02-29 4
Useful for advanced research and last minute bookings. Have found user ratings of establishments to be very accurate.
Version 6.1 2012-06-22 5
Mostly because you'll avoid the tourist traps.
Version 6.6 2012-10-13 3
But I'm not a fan of apps that just present the mobile view of sites. I would prefer to see things much smoother, such as moving from one photo to the next.
Version 6.6 2012-11-16 3
Decent hotel. Good location. Poor service -front desk verging on rude. Restaurant service not friendly. Over all not very helpful. Only thing going for them is their location.
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 5
It's very easy to use & quite useful for on the go searching & booking :)
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 4
Very good app. Responds quickly, no noticeable lag. Did not rate it 5 stars because it's my first day using it.
Version 6.2 2012-06-28 5
Great app and a useful way to get an unbiased opinion on travel wherever you are
Version 1.0 2008-07-17 1
You would expect this to come from someone's garage, not a large company.  Slow, mixes information for listings when you scroll.  It lists a local chinese takeout as mexican!!!!  It's too bad, because if it worked as expected it would be a great app for traveling and finding hidden restaurant gems.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
Very useful.  Let's you see what hotels are in an area and to get real reviews by people that have stayed there
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
Downloaded the app since I use the online version. Works just as good!
Version 6.3 2012-07-13 4
I just landed in fort worth tx & was staying in a hotel, downloaded this app & read all the reviews b4 I checked in
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-23 4
Generally good, but can't flip through all photos on iPad.  Does first 5-6, then stops.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 5
Excellent. Easy to navigate and good to read other reviews
Version 8.5 2014-03-13 5

Version 4.1 2011-08-07 5
Generally spot on. Mobile apps works well. Price is right too.
Version 5.9 2012-01-04 5
Very clear and precise. Im so glad it's free. Even for a buck I'll buy it.
Version 5.93 2012-03-14 5
We book all of our vacations with TA's help. Know before you go.
Version 6.0 2012-03-25 5
A must for travelers.  Know what you are getting into before going into the restaurant.
Version 6.1 2012-06-10 4
so far good just some of the places the geo-locations are off...have to use some more but for free it is a very good app.
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 5
Made planning our vacation SO much easier!
Version 6.2 2012-07-03 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-06-01 5
Lead me  thru an entire vacation in NM with GREAT recommendations! Use it for everything now :-)
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 1
When searching for all area attractions, you always have to use your current location otherwise, providing a city either returns no results or only a few results. This is highly annoying because I would like to review area attractions in other cities. The app is useless if I can't do that.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 2
I loved this app for a very long time. Using it to plan a trip. The last two days I haven't been able to view any photos. :((. Very frustrating and upsetting. Hope you guys fix this or I no longer have any use for this app. Thank you
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
Always using and always satisfied

Version 5.9 2011-11-12 5
Easy to use. Although the website works well, the app is much better.
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 4
Is always my first reference point when looking for hotels, restaurants and things to do.
Version 6.0 2012-03-23 5
Great before you go, and " Near me Now" handy when you get there.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
Don't like that I have to view Landscape.  And it just doesn't seem to be as intuitive as the normal website.
Version 6.3 2012-08-02 5
Don't go anywhere without 1st checking Trip advisor!!!! Luv this app!! EASY & FAST!!!!
Version 6.6 2012-12-15 5
Very helpful for me and my family!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 1
Used to have a feature that would tell you what is near what you are searching. I am not talking about "near me now." I'm talking about What's nearby. Please bring that back! No one is going to want to stay at a hotel if they can't tell what restaurants are near, etc. Without that this is a useless app.
Version 8.3 2014-01-03 5
Love this app!  Easy and straight forward to use.
Version 5.5 2011-04-24 5
Use it all the time with my frequent travels.

Great easy to use app! ALWASY works when I'm on the go!
Version 8.3 2014-01-02 5
Great app! It gathers the best information and outs it all in one package
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-11 2
Their website more or less forced me to use the app and it's visit website links show you everything within the app which is limited in functionality
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 4
Nice app, always use it before booking hotels and restaurants.
Version 6.6 2013-02-25 5
App does it's job. Easy to use, not buggy and helpful.

Version 6.3 2012-08-05 4
Like that it brings up the actual names of places instead of just dropping pins!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 2
The upgraded version doesn't have a back button in forums and some of the selections don't work.  I use the forums a lot for research and its almost impossible to use now.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 5
I trust the reviews posted on Trip Advisor.  More reviews than other sites.  The Trip Advisor Off-Line Guides are awesome, too!
Version 5.6 2011-05-25 5

I love being able to plan and write reviews from my iPhone!
Version 6.6 2012-09-29 3
Selected Branson missouri and when i went to go to the next page, the app kept going to branson west missouri. Would not let me review more than one page
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 2
While I like the site and use it often, the app is clunky, unintuitive, and pretty bare bones. Not much going on with it, and missing far too many functions (like results sorting) that make it a headache to use. Deleting soon.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-03 5
Used to find lodge in Amazonia, judge restaurant options in London ...
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 5
Never can plan a trip anymore without my advisor!
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
Trip advisor takes the guesswork out of traveling!
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 4
I thought I would try it, now I will use it every time I go somewhere
Version 5.91 2012-01-12 4
This is the best way to get the best info when traveling , but I wish that they don't just depend on only the travellers review , I wish they have there own.
Version 5.93 2012-03-11 5

Amazing! Never travel Anywhere without it!

Expected.  Helps a lot when trying to please in-laws.

I have loved trip advisor for years. We use it for researching all of our trips. I even use it before I go to local places!
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5
I always rely in the user photos to see the actual hotel the way it really is
Version 6.6 2012-11-09 5
Easy to use, convenient, very helpful app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-16 5
Super easy to use, fun to rate and even better to find the best places to stay.
Version 2.0 2008-08-27 3
I can't seem to get the search filter function to work right. Also, it would be nice to be able to search by cuisine type. Other than that, a nice application.
Version 5.5 2011-05-05 5
I'm always checking things out, even in my home town which is NYC!
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5

Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
Simply amazingly useful when planning a trip
Version 5.8 2011-08-11 4
An extension of the website. I find it to be very useful, especially traveling in a city I'm not familiar with.
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 5
Great app. Very helpful and people are genuine that review. Go for it. Download now.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
Just started using this ap and am already very impressed with it!
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 4
The app works great for what it offers. But it'd be nice to have the ability to set flight fare alerts like on the web site.
Version 5.5 2011-05-08 4
Use this app to plan your trip or vacation. It is easy to use and helpful with reviews from others.
Version 5.6 2011-05-20 4
Personally I love the yelp app...but it's only useful domestically. Trip advisor isn't quite as slick but it's very very helpful!
Version 5.6 2011-06-11 5
Greatly helped me plan my Italy trip & find local gems too.
Version 5.7 2011-08-06 5
Fantastically intuitive. Easier than the web site.
Version 5.9 2011-11-08 5
This is the go-to place/app for travel!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
A great tool for any out of town visit you make.
Version 6.6 2013-03-19 4
This is a great way to use the reviews although it would be even better if it had offline storge
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
It's very helpful in finding hotels, Resturaunts and things to do.
Version 6.6 2013-02-13 3
Found what I want. Could have given a 4. 

Back button goes all the way to the first blank entry. So I need to retype everytime. 

No Forward button.
Version 6.6 2013-03-01 5
I love and use Trip Advisor constantly I trust it for great advice while traveling.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-06 3
I love trip advisor but the updated app is not as user friendly. I still use it, but find myself going to the website more rather than use the app.
Version 8.3 2013-12-30 1
Badly done. Example: no coffee category. Cafe doesn't find coffee shops. One coffee house is listed as fast food. There isn't any fast food category in the app with which to find it again! Totally incompetent, these are extremely obvious and basic failings. And stop asking for location turned on!
Version 5.6 2011-06-20 5
I work for a hotel and I found a better one night rate PLUS parking while I flew to Hawaii. Awesome.
Version 5.9 2012-01-01 5
Helpful, fun and easy to navigate-what else could you ask for?
Version 5.91 2012-01-15 4
Most of the website functionality and appears to run well on limited bandwidth.
Version 6.1 2012-04-04 4
Very useful, well designed app. Would be nice if you could choose between bing and google maps
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5
Something you should use before travel
Version 6.3 2012-08-10 5
Great app for both looking up info & writing reviews.
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
Love this app! I have been using the site for years and the app just makes it better!!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-20 5
Great app provides all the information I needed and very user friendly
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 4
Use Locate and it finds all kinds of stuff around me. Add a kid specific checkbox and a translator for the reviews and you'd be set!!!
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 5
Use Tripadvisor on my pc's all the time. Super convenient on the ipad. This is a must use app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-05 5

Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Do not leave home without this app! Perfect on road trips. So easy to use.
Version 8.2 2013-12-05 4
I like it.. I wish to edit "to do" list and save map locations in list that would sort my picks by distance
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 4
More or less works good for when I don't use the website. No problems to speak of. Super easy to post pics of businesses.
Version 5.5 2011-04-26 5
I love this app it so fast and readily available I will tell my friends about this app.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5

Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
Captures all of tripadvisor's resources in a very easy to use interface.
Version 5.5 2011-05-08 5
It's everything I've come to depend on with the on-line Trip Advisor, but in handy app form!
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 4
Just started to use the app and I love it. I use it to confirm what the hotel recommends for dining and it has helped me to avoid touristy places.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 3
Every time I enter in a location to find hotels in that area, the map doesn't focus on the area causing the hotels that popped up to disappear before I can see them. Other than that, it works great.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
I always take printouts from TA but with this handy app, I've got it to go!
Version 5.7 2011-08-03 5

We use this app for all of our travel. The google of travel!

This app makes it easy to leave my notebook at home and travel light!

Version 5.9 2011-12-11 5
This is fab and I use it above all others.
Version 5.9 2012-01-04 5
I travel a lot and this app has been a life saver so many times. Real reviews by real people.
Version 6.6 2012-09-28 4
Easy to use app. We use trip advisor all the time when trying to decide which hotel to us and sites to see.
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 5
This helps a lot when you run out of things to do.
Version 5.6 2011-05-26 4
Works well, easy to use. Would be nice to have more search choices but all around a useful app.
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 5
Reasonable reviews and a lot of information, buy still a lot to add

Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
Can't live without the restaurant finder when I'm out of town!
Version 5.9 2011-11-24 1
You could say the earth is flat and they'd post it. Who knows what's true?! Emails are ignored when letting them know that things are coincidentally listed twice. There's no supervising of the site when contributors add pics of their kids and pets in the "Things To See" category.  It's ridiculous.
Version 5.92 2012-01-30 5
Great integration with iPad. Works seamlessly.  Well done.
Version 5.92 2012-03-14 4
Haven't used it very much, but it works great so far.  Also check out the downloadable city guides.
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 5
I use trip advisor all the time for travel and have never been stirred wrong!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-13 5
I usually signed on the website to use trip advisor, but this app is SO much better!
Version 5.92 2012-02-14 5
Very good. Wonderful especially when you're an out-of-towner & don't the area.
Version 5.93 2012-03-03 5
When I go somewhere on vacation, this site is my first stop
Version 6.6 2013-01-01 3
Fix the app so that it turns off location services. Burned 10% of battery with 20 minutes of use. Really silly.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-03 5
Rooms, services, location, beautiful hotel.  So very helpfull.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-07 5
Very easy to use. Trust this site and always look up hotels and restaurants.
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 2
Has a lot less functionality than just using the web site. Can't enter dates when searching for a hotel to check for actual availability, which seems like the most important criteria.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
It's very useful to find anything related to travel.
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 5
This is a must when planning a trip anywhere.

The food was amazing. We had the Cuban nachos and the combo platter. The food was fresh and reasonably priced. We will be back!
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 2
Every time I log on to my TripAdvisor account through Facebook on my iPod Touch, it crashes. I am only able to sign in through my Facebook, but it won't let me in. This glitch needs to be fixed.
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 3
Switch from a hotel review to safari to check some stuff out? Good luck, you'll have to start all over in TripAdvisor.
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5
Simple to use and very we'll designed .
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
I've been use tripadvisor for 2 years,and the app make it easier,love it.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 2
When using the map to search for accommodations hotels just come and go. Hotels I just looked at 2 minutes earlier are now gone and don't return. On the left tool bar why does it say #2 of 10 but I only see 3 listings?
Version 6.2 2012-07-02 3
This is a relatively good mobile adaptation of TripAdvisor. However, I feel myself longing for easier navigation offered by their full website.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-22 2
How do you find your own personal stats in terms of number of reviews written, page views, contributor level, etc?  It's just turned into a directory with no information for registered users.  Don't get the redesign. At all.
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 4
This a very useful app that I use to plan trips.  could improve more in restaurant searches by ethnicity.
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 5

A functional and stylish update to one of the best travel tools around.
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 4
This is a great app- only wish is to be able to filter by price for the hotels! And perhaps distance. Very appreciative for what it offers though!
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
When I searched for hotels, it gave me a lot of choices to pick from.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
This is a fantastic app!  Makes planning all aspects of a trip remarkably easy!
Version 5.7 2011-06-29 5
Don't leave home without it on your iPhone!

I love this app.  Have used it all over the US and Hawaii.  Would not leave home with out it.
Version 5.8 2011-09-05 5

Version 5.7 2011-08-05 5
It's better than to have photo shown on the side which is same as the homepage.
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
It is just amazing to feel home all around thanks to trip advisor ;)
Version 6.1 2012-06-19 5
This app is a great help when I am looking for hotels to stay in when I travel.
Version 6.1 2012-04-11 5
We travel a lot and have learned to rely on TripAdvisor. App is well done and useful.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5

Need to know more about your destination ? This is the app you want 

Happy Travels!

The list of hotels is nice, but you need to add whether the place is pet friendly for those of us who travel with our dogs. 

Restaurant reviews were very helpful for us in West Yellowstone.

So far excellent. I've only had it one day but so far I think it's great.

A great app...use it frequently for trip planning and hotel reviews
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 2

I just like the no hassle option of what's near by.
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 1

Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
Better than expected! Even has street view, this is better than the online website..
Version 3.0 2011-06-29 5
Really helps to read people's detailed comments.
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 4
Always check it before take off
Version 5.92 2012-02-14 3
Would it be too much for people to comment on wether the places are wheelchair friendly or not? It certainly help many travelers and their companions.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-12 5
This is a very useful app while on the go, or any time.
Version 5.6 2011-06-11 4
Just got it and ready don't know how I didn't have it before. Makes life a lot easier here in Bordeaux right now!
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 1
Sure it's probably great to know what hotels there are nearby.  But knowing what hotels have vacancy is actually useful information. In fact I'll go as far as saying it's crucial and that's why I only give this 1 star. Unless I can stay there it's only annoying to know how great it could have been.
Version 5.7 2011-07-12 5
There are so many good features on this app!  A must if you want to travel
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 5

Loved tripadvisor in Alicante, Spain. Found our first great lunch in Spain here. Italian of course..
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
I used to spend hours on this app looking at pictures, etc. Now, I can't even get to the pictures. I use my iPad & I hate that it won't flip around when I move it. It just stays in one place. Bring back the old app with all of the pictures for easy viewing or I won't be using trip advisor anymore.
Version 6.1 2012-04-23 5
Nice layout of the app and very good information.
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
Fast and reliable app that provides all the goodness of trip advisor.
Version 6.6 2012-10-13 1
Using iPad, authorized Trip Advisor to use my current location.  It made nothing of it. Typed in my specific address.  It couldn't find what part of the planet I was on. Typed in current city - but what is the use of that? What am I to make of >2000 restaurant reviews scattered all over Barcelona?
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
Great app it has been so useful when traveling
Version 5.8 2011-08-28 5

Trip advisor is the best site and best app I have ever seen, actually its like all-in-one simple as that.
Version 6.6 2013-01-13 5

Keep up the good work.
Version 6.6 2013-02-16 5
This is my goto app for travel in and out of the country!!!  Great job!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-18 3
The idea is worth 5*

The app for an iPad is worth only 3 because of the number of bugs or intentional functionalities that make the app somewhat frustrating to use.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-14 5
This comes in handy while traveling...
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-23 2
When I try to view pictures from restaurants in Rio, my screen gets all wacky & I can't back out without deleting the ap & redownloading it. Really annoying in otherwise useful ap!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
love the "near me now" and live map features.
Version 5.6 2011-07-31 5
Without a doubt the best travel app out there. Has yet to steer me wrong.

Version 5.9 2012-01-08 5
I never go on vacation without checking hotel reviews on trip advisor!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 2
App was excellent. Now fair! Should have left things be.. Old app easy to use and showed complete results. This one hard to use and limits things to map area rather than city. Still can't figure. How to get b&b's under hotels. A miss.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 4
Really like the insight that is gained by others sharing their experiences.  Use this app often on iPad  and I phone
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Very helpful when planning a trip
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 5

Flight search and airfare compare couldn't be any easier with this app!

I use this app all the time when I'm traveling somewhere new.  I have found the top rated attractions to be spot on.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
so easy to use!  Writing reviews are very simple and planning trips are made easy!
Version 5.92 2012-01-29 5
Thank you for creating such a great app, all info is available at your finger tips.
Version 6.1 2012-05-03 4
Useful info streamlined in one app w a good user interface. Also, new info can be added easily, so it's improving.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-10 1
You can only have horizontal use, which I never like to use. It doesn't have all of the features of the website: for instance, on the app I can't look back at what I previously reviewed. It's just not as good as the website; no reason to download.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-28 3
Don't appear to be able to change currency or distance units. Has difficulty choosing nearest town in rural areas.
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
Great application, everything you need for traveling
Version 5.5 2011-05-02 5
Best application for traveling you can relay on it
Version 5.6 2011-06-15 5

Love doing research before travel as well as the "what's near" feature once you arrive.
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 5
With the built-in map, one can pin point exactly where to stay.
Version 5.9 2012-01-02 5
I have liked Trip Advisor on other platforms and the iPad app does not disappoint.
Version 6.5 2012-11-10 5
This is the site I use when I travel or when  I want to try something new.

Use it for vacations and meals out.  Always helpful.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 2
I love the actual tripadvisor website and never choose a hotel without checking TA first. That said, I hate the app now. I like it before the OS7 changes. Now I hate it. Wish I could undo the so called upgrade.
Version 8.2 2013-12-10 5
It's handy and very helpful when travelling!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 4
I just wish it was easier to sort and a little more stable as it locks up on occasion

Easy to use to find good price for traveling.

Version 6.1 2012-05-25 5
This is really, really handy app to compare traveller viewpoints.
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 5
Use it all the time. If there are poor reviews I just don't go there. Very trustworthy.
Version 6.6 2013-04-20 4
But why not add a feature that allows users to share newly discovered thingstodo.
Version 8.2 2013-12-05 3
Crashes often since last update. Perfect, informative app, otherwise. If crash problem is fixed, it would rate 5 stars.
Version 8.3 2013-12-23 5
I take Trip Advisor with me everywhere I go!  I use it for everything!
Version 6.5 2014-01-28 5

Version 5.7 2011-08-09 3
When installed the app in the iPad, i can't search or book a flight because there isn't an option to that in portuguese translation of the app.
Version 5.8 2011-08-13 5
My first time really using it but it came in very handy.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
Just has to be the greatest  service!
Version 5.0.1 2010-09-11 2
Navigation through the menus does not work like other iPhone apps, which made it hard to navigate. Please fix this and I'll try again. Thanks. I like the offering on the web site. I hope the app can keep up.
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 5
Easy to use app - nice to have Trip Advisor right at your fingertips.  Don't travel without it!

Its good enough to collect and share information.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 3
I can't seem to find the option for flexible dates when searching flights.  Is that still a feature?  If yes, please tell me where.  If not, it's a problem.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-06 3
I really like tripadvisor, but I've really come to expect iPad apps to support both portrait and landscape. Also I cannot copy text from reviews.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-13 4
My only complaint is not being able to see your inbox  and reply to messages in the app.
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 5

Version 6.2 2012-07-08 5
Much better than yelp
Version 6.6 2013-03-25 1
Opened the app and it wouldn't do anything, just sat there appearing to load. None of the buttons worked. Reinstalled and still the same problem. 

I looked at the mobile website and it's exactly the same, the app just provides the interface outside of Safari.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-18 5
Excellent app to get the scoop on the best places to stay, eat and entertain.

LuLu's Oceanside Grill. The BEST Strawberry Twist Martini EVER. Have Ginger make it. Will travel back just for that. Also my favorite wrap- ahi tuna, Fabulous !

Tripadvisor is the FIRST resource we look at when looking for places to stay or eat and things to do when we are on the road!
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 5
Loaded with many options
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 4
Excellent for hotels and restaurants. Less good for the sites because there are only reviews and no additional materials.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-08 1
I saved a number of places, restaurants, etc for 2 upcoming trips. Now, when I try to locate them, TA tells me I have to login, then transfers me automatically to Google Maps, WITHOUT ALLOWING ME TO LOGIN ANYWHERE! How can I find my Saves if you won't let me login??? Total fail, completely useless.
Version 5.4 2011-04-18 5
Works better than the actual website.  I use it all the time and love it
Version 5.9 2012-01-09 5

Amazing app! However, it could be even better if i could forward a hotel or a search by e-mail.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
I love it! Only wish it would rotate to wide (landscape).
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5

Version 5.6 2011-05-19 5
Excellent application, very intuitive!
Version 5.6 2011-05-30 3
I found this when searching on safari on iPad. Definitely not as good fro starting your search. Seems like it might be good once you get situated.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 4
Tested this out at Inner Harbor. Got some good restaurant and hotel rates. Now I'm ready to use it when I take the family to Myrtle Beach. Good app!
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 1
The 'near me' knows where I am but consistently suggests things that are in bigger city 25 miles away, so hard to search and navigate, will not be using TA on iPad anymore and may not even use it at home as I am so intensely annoyed with new app, which is a huge step backward in functionality.  Horrible.
Version 5.9 2012-05-07 5
I love and use this app constantly for work and leisure travel.
Version 6.4 2012-08-23 4
I use this app often and find it easy to use, very helpful, and well organized.

Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
No business traveller should be without it. Accurate and to the point.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 3
Basic and clear, but search functionality by other features such as keywords is lacking...
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
Still like using Trip Advisor on my pc better than this app, but when travelling it's easy to use!
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
Great for planning a trip. Also try the city guide app from Trip Advisor
Version 6.2 2012-06-13 5
Great for finding a hotel and things to do after you get there.
Version 6.6 2013-03-12 4
I love the service and the user generated content. The app could be a little cooler and easier to use, auto sorting and such.
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 2
The feature I used most in the previous version was "Near me know" to find restaurants on the interactive map. This feature has been removed in the latest version. I wish I had never updated this app.
Version 5.7 2011-07-27 4
I use this app constantly and really rely on it. I do wish that My Saves synced between the website, iPad and iPhone apps.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
Gets things done for your travels
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5

Version 5.5 2011-04-24 5
I am a frequent traveler; Every week I'm flying out to a different state or country. I remember a few years ago, to share a good travel tip with others, I would tell them about 4-wheel luggage, noise-cancelling headphones or no-iron pants. While all of those are still appropriate travel tips for anyone, I now let others know about the great TripAdvisor app. I looked around for a travel app that could make my research of a new city quick and easy, and that would put information right at my fingertips when I needed it. I've found that, and more, with this TripAvisor app. 

When the app loads, you can run a search either using your current location, or by typing in your desired destination. I love how after you type the name of a city, you have a sorting feature that let's you choose between places to stay (hotels), where to eat (restaurants) and what to see (local attractions). You can get even more granular than that and sort any of these by their ratings or by placing them on the built-in attractive map. I love that reviews come from people like you and me who have explored an area and are willing to share their experiences. This app gives me a good feel for the neighborhoods I will be visiting and it highlights for me what I can focus my limited time on so as to maximize my visit.  

Other great features include the option of being linked to websites associated with the places on the map, so if you want to check out the menu of the restaurant with the great reviews, you can access it directly from TripAdvisor. You can also browse pics that have been uploaded by other users and you can contribute your own content by way of reviews and your own photographs. It's a social app as much as it is an info app. 

Now that I've downloaded this on my iPad, I go to it repeatedly and it's that 'just in time help' when I needed at my fingertips. Try it out, it's definitely worth a shot.
Version 6.6 2013-01-06 5
Gives me all of the info I need when traveling.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 5
Finally a tool that helps you find places to visit.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-01 5
I love sharing my experience with you
Version 5.4 2011-05-26 5
This is one of the cleanest and least glitchy iPad apps I use.
Version 5.6 2011-06-25 5
Everything you need to vicinity search and explore.
Version 5.7 2011-07-22 5

Version 5.9 2011-11-26 4
The split screen is great for familiarizing yourself with everything geographically.
Version 5.9 2011-12-14 5
If you love traveling inexpensively, this app is a must have!!! The flight fares are amazing!!!
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
Easy to use. See "street view" of hotels.  Better than website (which is awesome too).
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 4
Seems to be quite a few kinks.... Hopefully will get some fixes soon!
Version 6.2 2012-07-02 5

We use this app on all our vacation trips. Works great on iPhone an iPad.
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 5
This app is one of a kind and is super helpful where ever you go.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 1
Latest version removed functionality that made this app indispensable.  Used to be able to search hotels purely by scrolling the map and having it update the hotel selection automatically.  Not so any more... Frustrating and disappointing.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-03 5
Works great and nice to have at my fingertips
Version 5.4 2011-05-04 5
Much easier to navigate than regular site. A great companion to Expedia.
Version 6.0 2012-03-16 4
Its good and professional site. Location of hotels are not accurate. Maps should be checked by site administer. Tx
Version 6.6 2012-10-10 2
Gives good rating but continues to give me airline reservations for 2 passengers. I have gone back and reset the search 3-4 times and had to just say forget it. However, rates were very good.
Version 6.6 2013-02-04 4
Whether you are traveling for business or leisure, be sure to spend some time on Trip Advisor first.
Version 7.1 2013-07-17 5

Version 6.2 2012-06-28 5
It's great easy to use and a MUST for traveling :)
Version 6.2 2012-07-08 5

Amazes how thorough this app is
Quite an extensive data base
Use it much
Thanks
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-09 3
I think it needs more work. I cannot save reviews that I want to save. It is Important to be able to save Tripadvisor reviews to a folder of different trips.
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
Intuitive user friendly helpful must-have
Version 5.91 2012-01-14 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-12 2
Nice app that seems to do most things it can fairly well w/o crashing, but not everything from the web is available here.  Not that I trust their references but I prefer getting the best info from the forums.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 5
Downloaded app while on vacation. Great tool to have. Easy and fast to use.
Version 6.4 2012-09-16 5

Version 5.92 2012-01-31 5
Everything you need to plan the perfect vacation
Version 6.0 2012-03-19 4
Your new format is an great improvement. But, there is no obvious way to book a room.
Version 5.5 2011-04-27 5
Just like it's online equivalent, great asset to anyone planning or taking a trip.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 4
No issue, but I wish it shows more airline consolidators who wished to see more flights choices.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-10 5
Love this app! I use this to help plan all my trips
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-01 5

Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
I love trip adviser   Reading the reviews helps me decide where to go all the time
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 3
One used to be able to map directly. Now you have to go through Bing, ads, etc. Please shift it back the way it was.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I have it on my iPhone, and it is even better on the iPad.
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 4
I've found attractions I didn't know were close by some of my frequent destinations.
Version 6.3 2012-08-27 4
It is not perfect. I have concerns of "plants" posting in the forums. But I believe it is the most reliable available.
Version 6.6 2012-12-29 4
Sync my favorites across devices would be nice.
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 5
Like the desktop app but better because it does location.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Hotels and customers need to know before you sign in.
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 4
I use this app frequently and find the reviews accurate for the most part
Version 6.6 2012-12-30 4

Version 5.5 2011-04-26 5

App doesn't access all of the info available on the website.  Moreover it accesses Bing for maps which doesn't allow you to locate your current location so the map info is useless on the iPhone.  Should have left it with google maps.  Please improve.

Version 7.1.1 2013-09-25 1
Keeps losing the parameters of my search so I must continually redo.  Sloppy UI layout. If you change your search to location or price often times it seems to lose what you were previously searching for.  Use the browser based version.  It's far less annoying.

Version 5.5 2011-04-14 5

I am a "member" of TripAdvisor online. When I tried to use the app to check on updates to something I posted I found that you could only sign in via Facebook. What if I don't have a Facebook account?  The app is unusable for me. Website = cool, app = terrible.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
Awesome apps very useful, lots of information. A must to have that's all I can say...... Amazing!!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 2

When I add something to "saved" it resets the search results to page 1. Also doesn't show all results. For example, while searching for hotels in DC, it only provided 50 results. I like the layout though
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 5
I've used this on many occasions and recommend it!

Version 6.6 2012-12-07 1
I live in an area in L.A. and I used this area where I lived (and knew) as a test.  It totally missed three of the closest/better and largest restaurants, but DID show all the town choke-and-pukes (and the other nicest and larger restaurants have been here longer)! 
FAILED.
**Delete for L.A area**. Not sure for other places.

The content is useful and the new design is nice but still feels slow and unresponsive compared to other travel iOS apps. I had higher expectations for this new version. Please make it a native app!

Great app for finding awesome places and deals anywhere in the world.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 3
Wish I didn't upgrade.  The older version was much more user friendly - easier to navigate and find what you want.
Version 7.0.1 2013-11-26 2
Please hasn't changed since 1975. Only two restaurants and the food was horrible. If you budget is low and your expectations are lower it's the perfect place. You get what you pay for.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 4
And for checking out things that look good, but might not be all they appear to be.

Version 8.0 2013-11-02 5
Much easier than the website on iPad.
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 1
This app was almost perfect. The mapping was a little klunky so when it said the update made that better I upgraded. There is no more sorting by price so I will stop using this app and slow down on my reviews for TripAdvisor. This is a rare misstep for them.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-18 5
I absolutely love this app, and wouldn't travel without it.
Version 5.6 2011-06-11 5

What an improvement!  I couldn't ask for more from a free app!!!
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
Lets you get acquainted with an area
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 1
This ap is nothing like the web version. When you look at the maps you have split screen and makes viewing large areas difficult. Hard to find attractions for the area you are viewing. Very frustrating ap especially if you are used to using Tripadvisor.
Version 5.93 2012-03-02 4
Gives lots of information and feedback from firsthand experiences
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 3
I use Trip Advisor a fair bit, for the reviews and forums, so I got the app. I find it not as easy to navigate as the website. The choices for searches are limited. Stick to the web.
Version 6.6 2013-02-14 5
This app is grate for planning va-kays and activities and restaurants awesome

Version 6.6 2012-10-13 1
My husband and I, with another couple, stopped at the Gondola Cafe in Corfu, Greece because they stated they had free wifi with a beverage purchase.  The wifi connection ended after 10 minutes and we paid nearly $21 US for a coffee, tea, and a small fried cheese (our friends paid $15 for two coffees).
Version 6.6 2012-12-08 4
This is a great app that I use anytime I am considering travel for business or vacation.

I love the Tripadvisors website, but don't see a big value in this add
Version 6.3 2012-08-07 4
Great for planning a vacation. Indispensable and easy to use. But no longer shows b&bs! One star off!
Version 6.6 2012-11-30 4
Really good finding restaurant's, etc.  Doesn't list everything.
Version 6.6 2013-03-24 5
This is a great app.  I have found 2 great hotels in cities I was unfamiliar with.  Reviews are so helpful.
Version 3.0 2009-01-13 1
Only provides access to restaurants but doesn't give much info in the app. What would make this app good would be to be able to access trip advisors data and write reviews. Still needs work, better apps avail. for restaurant searching.
Version 5.5 2011-04-28 4
Whether you are researching or visiting far from home this is the perfect app to plan your vacation.
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 4

The map display and the corresponding list of restaurants/hotels/etc. are not in sync.  When returning to the map after calling up restaurant detail it doesn't return to the same scale of the area.

Great for looking great deals near  some places that you have to go!!!

Version 8.3 2014-01-01 3
I don't know why it is such a stripped down version of the website. And why it allows such limited access to those logged in.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-22 5
Works great. Won't travel away from home without it.
Version 5.7 2011-06-27 4
All the information has been accurate and the reviews are a great help. Congratulations.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
All the places we have been based on their recommendations were great!
Version 6.1 2012-04-03 2
There are 4300 restaurants listed for Chicago and less than 2000 classified.  Also need classifications for Breakfast and Late / 24 hours.  I downloaded the app while travelling and it is of limited use
Version 6.1 2012-04-23 4
App doesn't merge w/online acct so no aggrate rating profile exists...  No consistant way to add new restaurants/hotels.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-07 3
It's a browser more than an app. Very buggy. HOWEVER, if you like trip advisor you should still get it.
Version 5.6 2011-06-20 5
Love this app. Makes planning trips s breeze!
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5

Version 5.7 2011-06-25 4
Trip Advisor is a good app, but doesn't have a log in ability like normal Internet page.  Great for finding restaurants on the fly!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 5
Great app. I've based several trips off this app/website alone...

Love having trip advisor on my iPhone. It has come in handy so many times.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 4
This app needs the restaurant 1760 pub~n~grill in trexlertown Pennsylvania other than that it's pretty good
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-24 5
I love this app. I use it to plan trips and before visiting any attraction!
Version 8.1 2013-11-11 3
There is no way to search or filter by price or neighborhood. You'll need to go to the page of each hotel to find a price.
Version 5.7 2011-07-25 4
Wish that the app had as much capability as the online version.
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 4

Nothing more to say other than I love this app.
Version 5.5 2011-04-27 5
Easier to navigate than the actual website and the best travel site bar none.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
Be better if you could get directions to a location when looking at the map..
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 4
Needs improvement on the search area there is a great restaurant near me called chef adrianes n it didn't pop on my screen :/
Version 5.9 2011-11-16 5
This better stops the pop up asking me to review the app....
Version 6.6 2012-10-21 5

I have used Trip Advisor for years. This app is fast and convenient.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-24 3
How can I manage my profile? I want to know what I have review, how many have been helpful. 
I can see all that on the webpage but not on the app...

Worked well but lately won't search for a hotel. It will do everything else...but it claims it can't search without internet connection. 1. I'm on my phone & shouldn't need internet; 2. I AM connected to the internet.

Excellent service, great food & cold beer.  Highly recommend!
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 2
Unfortunately a web search reveals reviews for a lot more restaurants on Anna Maria Island than are accessible through the app. Not good. Let's hope this gets fixed in the next update.
Version 8.5 2014-03-07 5
Is really simple to use, and give you a lot of place to go.

Great app that we use all the time. Runs great on the IPad with a great display of info. Use it for reviews, research and exploring trips. Sarge
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 1
As they add new features,and "improved" experiences this program is becoming a buggy, crashy mess.  Was writing a review on trip advisor, a long review, and it crashed erasing all my work.  So now I am writing a review of the app instead. And the new map thingy: not so go as the old one.
Version 5.5 2011-04-15 5
The iPad version of this app is amazingly easy to use.
Version 5.5 2011-05-08 5

Help me so much always! From hotels to restaurant, always my best "bud" app.
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 1
Same interface and features as the mobile website, but worse. Try to jump one level back and it sends you all the way back to the home page where you have to start your search all over again. Stick to the web version and save the space on your phone.
Version 5.92 2012-02-11 5
Love being able to read honest reviews:) thx

This Tripadvisor app is the best reviewing app I have ever had on any operating device.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-09 1
Search option stinks if you are looking somewhere other than you current location. 

I looked up my fav italian restaurant to check out the menu, and it had a menu for a diff mexican place!  Terrible.

Do yourself a favor and use Yelp instead!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-28 1
This app has so many bugs it ought to be renamed bugadvisor-but hey, fanbois love thousands of buggy, almost useless apps from the bug store. And to top it off you have to update during the holidays - when it should be up and ready to advise you !!! 
Rubbish.
Version 8.5 2014-03-04 5
Essential to maximize any vacation experience.
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 4
This app is so handy when you are traveling.  It takes a lot of guess work out when you travel.

Version 6.4 2012-09-04 4
For people going to different places and willing to know what other people suggested or liked.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-19 4
If I can sign in, is there any reason I can't access my messages?  Pretty good app overall otherwise.

Version 6.6 2012-10-15 4
Useful but you cannot add new places. And the database for Latin America is still a work in progress.
Version 5.6 2011-06-15 5
I love the simple setup. Works great! Never had any problems!
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-24 5
This app is what i have been looking for.
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 1
Where are the nice features of the old version?  How do I see restaurants near my current location?  How to I revise the search for the new location I've moved the map to?

It looks to me as if TripAdvisor decided it was more important to make the app pretty than it was to make it functional.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-12 5
I use it weekly. A must have when traveling
Version 5.8 2011-08-22 4
Very cool app, but I miss the feature of the website. It is a quick way to book a hotel or flight.

Love how it shows things nearby to do. Will be useful.
Version 6.2 2012-06-21 1
I find the redesigned app utterly clumsy.  It is now locked in landscape mode which makes it largely unusable on the go. Further, the search function is slow and not very well thought out, requiring multiple queries to get to the right page/location.
Version 7.1 2013-07-16 5
Love it. Great suggestions and real feed back

Very useful for attractions in the Florida Keys. For information on sites in Yosemite National Park, it was less than comprehensive.
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 4
Quite handy when traveling around without a travel guide!
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 5
Found everything in this area. Accurate distance.

Version 5.7 2011-06-30 5
Great app--find myself using it rather frequently.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 4

Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 1

Used the website before the app is just as great!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-03 3
Works fine for finding a restaurant near your location. But for writing reviews the app is very difficult to use.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
I look here first to get hands on reviews.

Version 6.6 2013-10-11 2
Cannot set number of travelers. All links require a new search to change from the default, moving you off the selected property.

I always loved the website, and the app is just as good. Get it now!
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5
Since there isn't anything else as good as this. This is a good tool to have for any traveller
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 4
Slow, but good interface. Would love to have the top 20 destination list in app too

I like it, it was easy to use. And I liked how all the other info that was on the website was available here.
Version 5.8 2011-08-29 5
It's even more fun to use than their website.
Version 5.8 2011-09-26 4
...just one thing though....Wish there were more options to search the forums ....
Version 5.9 2011-11-22 4
I never book travel before checking the destination in Trip Advisor.
Version 5.9 2011-12-12 5
This was the cheapest deal any site could offer
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 5
I love this app! Helping me plan my vacation.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-21 4
I've noticed that most reviews on Trip Advisor are complaints.
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-06 3
If it is possible to submit a review using this application, it is impossible to figure out how to do so.  Otherwise, the data it provides is quite useful.
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 4
Fantastic for travel planning when detailed location info is important.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
I like the usability of this app.  Excellent all around information and pretty accurate.
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 4
Really easy to navigate and find what you need. The app's even better than the website!
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
Love finding new things and love contributing.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
Just love trip advisor, no facet goes uncovered.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 1
Why bother, this is just their mobile web site, not an iPhone app. Try a hotel search, no images on the list view? Give me a break. This app was definitely released just because they wanted app store presence, the content and user experience are an after-thought.
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 2
Doesn't have info on or even list non-fancy restaurants. There's not a single restaurant in Red Bank, TN, according to this map. Tripadvisor website appears to be much better, more thorough and objective.
Version 5.8 2011-08-17 5
Great info at your finger tips
Version 6.0 2012-03-23 2
I love to use TripAdvisor whenever I travel, but the app for my iPad is frustrating at best.  It is extremely difficult try find restaurants that match one's on their full website. I think it needs a lot more work.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
Great free application.  It really helps when I am traveling.
Version 5.92 2012-01-24 5
I like it very much. Photos help me to decide. Thank you

I always used! Very goid and fast information!

This app makes it so easy to write reviews, especially on the go.
Version 5.8 2011-10-13 4
I travel 23 nights out of the month and this app makes it nice searching for wanted and unwanted hotels.
Version 5.9 2011-12-20 5
Long time fan of the site and now I love the app.  Great for when you are on the go.
Version 6.0 2012-03-22 1
We only stay at B&B's and now it's hard to find them on the new version.  Apparently you have to search in a city for hotels then change hotel type and click off hotel and click on B&B.  There are many other apps that feature B&Bs that we will now use.
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 4
It's a great app but need more categories so we can find hotels more easily.
Version 8.2 2013-12-19 4
Always one of the tools I use when researching places to visit.
Version 8.3 2014-01-06 5
Handy app on iPhone while travelling

Very Informative & easy to use!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-10 5
We use Tripadvisor to help plan all of our trips!
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 3
It should allow you to input location being searched so you don't have to be in the area already. Did not provide nearby places.
Version 5.5 2011-04-24 5
Works well- reflects the actual website in a great way
Version 5.5 2011-05-01 4
Great content.  Instead of re hashing all the good stuff,I'd like to see more filters in the search function.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
Don't leave your house without it.
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 5
Saves you time, money, and gives you peace of mind.
Version 5.8 2011-09-03 5
Great app for travelers! Lots of places and the database is growing up

A must-have app if you ever go anywhere.
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 5
I use Trip Advisor on the computer a lot. It's nice to have a mobile version.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
Very usefull! A perfect guide in your hand. Download it now.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
using it every time I want to go someplace new. great app!
Version 6.1 2012-04-27 2
This used to be my favorite app.  But the new update is seriously bad, and I've had to switch to Yelp.  The zooming function no longer works at all, and the app hangs frequently.  I really miss my tripadvisor!
Version 6.3 2012-07-25 5
Way better than any other!  Key to happy vacation!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-28 5
Very helpful and can get exactly what I want
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 4
The app does almost everything the website does. The app does not have the sliding bar price.
Version 5.7 2011-07-03 4
Always use as a resource when looking for something to do or eat when in a new city
Version 5.4 2011-10-05 5
One of my most used apps.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 2
Look for flights for two people, shows results giving impression that prices are for two...wrong, go to book it, price was for one! Why then ask if you are searching for more than one ticket?!
Version 5.9 2011-12-19 4
I use TripAdvisor to look at hotels & restaurants in an unfamiliar area and it is a great help. I like reading what people write about a place.
Version 6.4 2012-09-15 2
Does not have all features of website. Numerous lodging facilities cannot be located on the map and therefore, don't show up for viewing. Only displays in landscape orientation.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 4
Works as expected with some neat features. The near me now is nice.
Version 5.7 2011-06-29 5
this has been so much help for travel plans
Version 5.93 2012-03-20 4
This is a good intuitive app.  I highly recommend to those who travel without definitive plans.
Version 5.9 2011-12-28 4
This is a must have app for travelers. Ot's amazing I found great places by using near me feature.
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5
This is a very easy and convenient tool for travel.
Version 6.6 2013-01-05 5
Must have for traveling
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-30 5
Love the reviews and the ease of navigating.
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 1
I love the "real" trip advisor, and use it frequently, but this mobile version just plain stinks!  It is poorly designed, has horrible search options, and takes forever to get any useful information.  I got it, and deleted it within one hour.

Big Thumbs Down !
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 4
I will be going to Las Vegas later this year.  I was able to map out my activities while there using Trip Advisor.....
Version 6.0 2012-03-21 5
Quick and easy! Just what this busy mom needed.
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 5
Great source of up to date information.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 2
An option to find hotels near an airport is essential (and missing). In big cities, I want to stay near the airport, and this app does not help. Hotels could be an hour's cab drive away, and there's no way of knowing.
Version 5.7 2011-07-08 5
Only used once but like it a lot.
Version 5.6 2011-08-25 4
Pretty sweet in a informative and intuitive app if you ask me

Very pleased.

Used it a ton when i travel. It has been a big help. Love the lay out.
Version 6.4 2012-08-19 4
Hands down one of the most useful apps out there. I love it and use it before traveling ANYWHERE!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 3
Full version is awesome, never travel without consulting.  iPad and iPhone versions are clumsy.
Version 5.5 2011-04-24 5
I'm a frequent traveler and this site is great for everything!
Version 5.8 2011-10-05 5
Invaluable travel aid for all levels of travel experience.

Version 5.5 2011-05-08 4
It could have been better if consisted more details for India!
Version 5.6 2011-05-30 5
Very impressed with the interface and responsiveness.
Version 5.9 2011-11-15 2
I look at trip advisor more for the entertainment value, because it is always so obvious when a hotel has written their own review.  The app is good as long as you don't put too much stock into what is being said on this site!
Version 5.9 2011-11-17 5
Really cool very nice... You find almost everything. Thumbs up!
Version 6.6 2013-02-03 5
I don't leave home without consulting this site.
Version 5.8 2011-08-20 4
Great tool to make decisions easier while away from home.

This site always helps me plan great trips!
Version 6.6 2013-01-16 3
Great for traveling on the go, but lacks features to access your own personal profile, reviews etc.
Version 5.92 2012-02-17 5
Especially if your lost in translation...
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-22 2
The new version needs a back button in the forums... Otherwise, how do you navigate/browse??   Other than that big issue, app is very useful.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 4
It is very helpful. But distance is not 100% correct. 5 km deviation for most of the places.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-21 5
App keeps on improving, I use it all the time, helpfull!
Version 5.7 2011-07-29 5

Very nice when trying to plan for things to see and do when traveling.

Great idea! Great to organize and plan, but just like city planner has lots of bugs. Often removes saved locations, often shut down, never gave directions, etc
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 5
Easy to use, works well, must own!
Version 8.5 2014-03-03 5

Really rely on reviews to make travel choices. Thanks.

Version 6.2 2012-06-16 5
This is a great app love price listing and explicit detail of the site chosen .

I won't delete from my apps, use as a guideline or idea for what to do or see,everyone's ratings are their own opinion

I still like Yelp, but trip advisor is more comprehensive, especially outside the US.

This app used to be awesome now I don't even understand how to get a proper list of restaurants in order by popularity.  It seems to be trying too hard to use the map feature and gives incomprehensible lists.  Bring the old app back please, this new update is awful!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 4
Tripadvisor is like having a local guide with you

This could be a great app, but falls way short. It uses a separate database from the website for some reason and I don't see any way to add a location if it isn't found. Hopefully they'll improve it the next time around.
Version 5.7 2011-07-09 5
Awesome food cooked perfect steaks, and the sides where huge.
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5
I'm in Guatemala and this app has been very helpful!
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 5
I travel a lot, and this app is the one I use the most!  Moved out west from the east coast a year ago and me and my husband love traveling on the weekends and exploring new places and the Trip Advisor app has been a life saver!! We've found an awesome B&B we love in Durango (Country Sunshine, which is the #1 B&B for good reason!) that we've gone too about 6 times now and we are now visiting Phoenix for the first time and found an awesome resort with a waterpark (Arizona Grand Resort) which our 15 year old loves!... And so do we!! (got to visit the Heard Museum and Botanical Garden!) the app is very user friendly and straight forward! And the IPad version is awesome!  Also as we were making our long trek from PA to NM found a really neat place to stay in Branson, MO... Thanks to Trip Advisor... Big Cedar Lodge... Beautiful!! I'm now trying to decide where we are going to have an awesome meal tomorrow in the Phoenix area.... The past two days breakfast has been great! Yesterday was Over Easy which was on Guy Fuiti's triple D... Was delish! Then this morning went to "the original pancake house" which originated in Oregon and my daughter said they were the best pancakes she ever had... WOW! She has pancakes everywhere!!! And I had their famous apple pancake which was totally amazing, and I could only eat a third of it it was sooooo big and the three of us are now eating as dessert tonight which still tastes amazing cold!!! This is one of my favorite apps definitely recommend to everyone!!!

Very informative. Huge help in planning a trip.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
This app used to be one of my favorites until the last update.  I can see the number of reviews and photos posted on my saves.  However, when I go to look at the new reviews or photos, there is no new ones!  It's not updating the reviews or the latest photos posted.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Very helpful app for anyone considering travel
Version 6.6 2013-01-22 3
Search finds everything regardless of current location.

Version 6.6 2013-03-03 5
Just downloaded the app- can't wait to use it on vacation in April in St. Martin
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-01 5
This app is very helpful and convenient.
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 4
Good app. It needs more though. Somehow the site is still better, which defies the purpose of an iPad app
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 5
Probably the best app because it's written by the tourists themselves
Version 6.2 2012-07-12 5
Love the quick access
Version 6.6 2012-10-20 5
App is as great as the website.  Has been extremely handy on the go.

Version 5.6 2011-06-09 5
A super useful app to plan and book hotels for my trip
Version 6.1 2012-05-05 3
I don't like apps that force me to keep the iPad sideways. My review would be higher if I could hold the iPad up like a portrait.

Very carefully constructed and intuitive
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5

I really like this app. It gives the most correct results every time. Whenever I use this app I never regret.
Version 5.9 2011-12-11 2
My number one need is searching for businesses before I travel. If I want SCUBA options in Cabo before I travel, the app is not able to find businesses I found online.  The search function is simply not intuitive enough.
Version 5.92 2012-02-02 5
I travel all the time! It's super useful and easy to use. I'm really glad I downloaded it!
Version 6.3 2012-07-20 2
Wanted this ap to find restaurants when traveling. Installed it, checked the restaurants in my local area, and found that most are missing. Intrface is good, but Goog & Bing maps are much more complete. 
Delete.

Helps me a lot with hotels and restaurants evaluations, especially.

I like the app and I am starting to use it more and more. Need to know how to add places to review. Great way to find things to do.
Version 5.6 2011-06-04 5
Simply amazing.
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 3
I like this app except when I zoom in on a map to look at different hotel options, it suddenly moves to another location.
Version 6.1 2012-05-16 5
Looks like it can be a part of my trip planning.

Just loaded the app and have only use it for a little while, but so far, so good.
Version 5.7 2011-07-15 1
I don't know why this place is rated so highly. By for the most bland seafood I've ever had. The king crab appetizer was smothered in a sauces that I'm pretty sure was velveeta rotel dip. The seafood platter had no flavor. On the upside, the wine was decently priced and our waitress Natalie was very friendly.
Version 5.8 2011-11-13 5
It's one app travelers will need!!
Version 5.92 2012-02-20 5
It's Awesome. The only site I use to find just the right hotel!!!!!!

I use this all the time. Love the location section as I often find restaurants based on this app
Version 6.6 2012-10-02 3
Unable to star a review if the restaurant is does not appear in the area. If i go to a restaurant and wants to write a review i am unable to be the first one to write because is nowhere to be found
Version 6.6 2012-11-17 5
I normally don't write reviews on apps, but this app is excellent!!!

Version 5.8 2011-09-28 5
Love trip advisor! We use it all the time all over the country
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 4
There's no "free lunch" so do not try eating this app but it's worth keeping for sure.
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 3
If only the owners of the listed facilities would be honest enough to not write several raving reviews on Trip Advisor about their own places themselves...
Version 5.6 2011-05-20 3

Version 5.6 2011-06-09 4
I use this app for both domestic and international travel. I find the reviews to be spot on. App is easy to navigate.

I cannot tell who is signed in. 2 people use it but I cannot tell which one of us is in the account.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-25 2
No it's not user error... It's just not there  for my selection anymore. Talking about the air watch alert. I can't find that thing anywhere on my mobile ap... I want it and need it so where is that thing hiding:(
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 5
We love Trip Advisor always good to read the reviews and suggestions.

Version 5.9 2012-01-09 3
I love the app for the ipad but there are missing a lot of restaurants and place that should be included in something called as a trip advisor
Version 6.1 2012-04-18 5
Search is fine, and writing a review is easy...
Version 6.6 2013-02-28 4
I find this app to be very helpful and resourceful! I utilize it often and truly rely upon it!

Use it to find restaurant reviews when we're out and about. Very helpful.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-26 1
I never go anywhere without first consulting TripAdvisor. But I don't like this app, it's just not very user friendly. Or maybe I just want it to be the actual website in an app. Either way, I'll just be visiting on my browser from now on.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Great app, I find it better than the actual website
Version 6.6 2012-12-13 5
Awesome when you are in a place you don't know!
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 3
I can't get signed in using Facebook. Annoyed. I know I have an account because I'm logged in on another device.
Version 6.2 2012-06-12 5
One of the best free apps there is - and I don't even travel that much

Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 1
I've tried three times to get flight information, and three times the website reverted to the hotel search default! I see no reason to continue to use TripAdvisor. It gets one star because the review process doesn't provide for negative ratings!
Flight Frustrated
Version 8.3 2014-01-04 3
Works good except you cannot access your private messages in the app. It's a social based site?
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5

Very handy. Not quite as complete as the web site, but all the essential features.
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 2
I just started using this App and the 1st thing I noticed is that under restaurants' filters, there is a large selection, but Kosher isn't one of them. Since it's the one that matters the most to me, I am rather disappointed.
Version 5.5 2011-04-18 4
Like it so far. It is clear and easy to use. Everything you need to know around is in this app

Can't search by pet-friendly, good for leisure, business, families, etc.
Version 5.91 2012-01-17 4
Easy & fast. Good resource when out of town. Reviews from travelers like me.
Version 5.92 2012-02-22 5
Won't visit a place without it's advice...
Version 5.92 2012-02-23 4
Very fundamental app, easily read & basic . What more is necessary?

Version 6.3 2012-08-02 5
Great for planning your trip in advance
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 1
If there is a link under Eatgood restaurant, I expect that will take me to the restaurant website where I can look at the menu. No such luck. With trip advisor all you get is more trip advisor!  The app is free and in this case you get what you pay for.
Version 8.1 2013-11-20 4
The app is limited on functionality
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 5
Great for ideas
Version 5.3 2011-08-11 4
This is a good find. It helps plan travel by finding hotels and other useful stuff.

A must have app if you travel and enjoy life.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
Excellent
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
User friendly n helpful to the traveler!!  Good job
Version 8.1 2013-11-09 2
Normally I don't spend much time writing reviews, but I really have enjoyed and relied on tripadvisor in the past. This version is clunky and does not load quickly. Please update.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 4
I found this app to be something I could use locally and on trips with the family.
Version 5.7 2011-08-06 3
Having a login account, I thought it would allow for me to see messages that have been sent. No cigar...
Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5
It's easier to use than my desk top at home.  Well done!
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
Very helpful app!!!
Beat google out of The park ..
It's all in one
Version 8.3 2013-12-28 5

Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5
Perfect ap - especially with the near me now function.

Version 5.93 2012-03-08 4
Excellent! Up-to-date information include photos and local map
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 1
The app seems the same as the website, but when you search, it keeps losing the search terms, so you need to keep re entering the city name. Incredibly frustrating. Frustrating enough for me to stop looking at the nice scenery and write this review.
Version 8.2 2013-12-04 5
Love this app
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-28 5
Such a wonderful site
Version 5.5 2011-04-25 5
I've been a fan of the website, and I like to use the app more.
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 4
I've found this program to be entirely helpful in planning my trips. It definitely is a valuable tool!
Version 5.7 2011-07-24 4
Would like to see a way to save lists and let list writers link places in the lists themselves.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
I used for our St Augustine trip and was very helpful!
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
Great app. It has a great flow to go from one view to another. Really helpful
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
We plan our vacations based on this app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Like the app. Easy to make use of.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 2
This APP would be a handy little too you if it wasn't so slow for the iPad.  I prefer user reviews over the traditional.  These are usually people "in the trenches" and do not get the special treatment.
Version 7.1 2013-07-27 5
Indispensable part of any trip-planning.
Version 5.5 2011-05-03 3
I've written 2 reviews but the program has trouble uploading them. Too difficult. My friend wrote a review that never appeared either.
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
Seems like an unbiased perspective
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 5
This is like having your own personal travel agent on your phone! I love it!!!!
Version 5.93 2012-03-18 4
For several years now we rely on this site when planning any trip. The advice is always Spot On!
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 5
Love this app-let's me share my thoughts on places I visit with such ease!

Version 6.6 2013-02-13 5
Very good source for getting
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-03 2
Your hotels were overrated for 3 consecutive times. Cannot be a coincidence. You are either getting incentives or you are not doing any quality control of client feedback.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Use it everytime on a trip and is very helpful. Finds what I need. Love the (near me now)
Version 5.93 2012-03-01 5
Essential tool for my wife's and mine travel planning!
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 2
I was enjoying this app but when I went to write a review it keeps giving me the message to correct the items highlighted in red.  The problem is that there is nothing highlighted in red.  Very frustrating.
Version 6.6 2013-03-30 5
Great app!
Version 6.6 2013-04-30 5
Simply the best traveling resource available.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 1
There's an old saying that goes like this."If it ain't broke don't fix it" 

Well Trip Advisor took a great app and ruined it. The map view was easier to navigate in the old version. There was more information on the screen than this new version. Bring back the old version.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
Use it all the time. A must have for all vacationers.
Version 5.4 2011-04-16 4
Use it often, but wish it allowed saving hotels, etc to my profile. Next update?

Really helpful and convenient when you need it.

Version 6.0 2012-03-15 4
I like it but I would like to be able to have access to menus with the resturant listings. Or their websites.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 4
This is by far the easiest and best travel comparison application I found so far. Good job!
Version 6.6 2013-03-01 4
So easy .....great deals.  Would be perfect if had more refinement options.
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
and this app came in very handy!
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Don't leave home without this!!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-15 4
Great app, like the current location feature. Wonder why we cannot login using my login?

In all other ways this app is almost perfect, but it's very annoying that you can't save your selections on the device.
Version 5.92 2012-02-17 5
This application is so great 
It helped me to find a good places in any city I went.
Version 6.6 2013-03-04 5

Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
Never leave home without it!
Version 6.6 2013-02-28 4
I am still trying to get used to this app, versus the website.  So far, am pleased with it.
Version 3.0 2009-08-09 1
Technically nice app. But the ratings and reviews are bogus. Pulled up my local restaurants and could not believe all the 4 and 5 star ratings for crud eateries. Even submitted some poor reviews for restaurants I know are bad...but the poor reviews never show up.  This app is rigged. Don't trust the ratings.
Version 5.8 2011-11-20 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 4
Pretty easy to use and navigate. Pls add portrait view for iPad.
Version 8.3 2014-01-04 5
Really good and helpful app to find almost anything...
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-18 2
Getting a lot of bugs on iPad mini, and new interface far less usable for looking up reviews than before. Disappointed.
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5
It's easy to use. I would like to see more options on things to do.

Use it all the time especially on vacation in new cities!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-25 3
I have tried some features with mixed results. Definitely needs to have the bugs addressed.
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 5
Use it all the time - great to be able to save favorites now!
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 4
I have used the app several times and it's becoming my go to app for travel.
Version 5.9 2011-12-12 5
Great app - great feedback! Use as a basic guide to help get a feel for area of travel.
Version 5.9 2012-01-01 5
I have yet to find a better site, and believe me I have tried!
Version 6.1 2012-05-25 3
I use Trip Advisor on my iPad and my iPhone. Saves don't sync even tho I sign in. Features are good but lack of syncing makes my pre-trip research useless.
Version 6.1 2012-06-12 5
Use it, review it, count yourself lucky to have it.
Version 6.3 2012-07-20 5
Fantastic app for all your travel needs!

Great app!!! I use it often when traveling.
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 5
Love feedback from large sample size - its great.
Version 8.1 2013-11-07 1
It never dawned on the designers of this app to include flexible search?  Makes this a second rate useless app. Plus their date quotes are often outdated, so when you try and book the flight, the prices have already gone up.
Version 5.8 2011-08-13 5
Quick reviews are a snap.  And easy look up!
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 4
I have used this app for info for travel in all continents except Antarctica
Always useful.

Not very stable. Often quit automatically.
Version 6.6 2013-01-14 5
...for planning the right trip or vacations.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 5
I have been using this app for a long time, I love it!
Version 8.5 2014-03-28 1
Deleting the app after I write this. Miserable hotel stay that could have been prevented by "good" reviews.  A supposedly heavenly place turns out to be trashy, loud, and at 1am I'm still trying to sleep. 
I'm done with TA.  I moved out of the trailer park long ago.
Version 5.8 2011-08-17 4
This app is as good as the actual site.  Can't give it five stars though...it doesn't have all the filters as I would like.
Version 5.8 2011-09-02 5
Very easy to navigate. A great way to plan your trip ahead of time.

Version 7.1.1 2013-08-17 5
The app makes writing reviews SO much easier!
Version 5.7 2011-07-27 4

Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
Great free app!!
Version 5.9 2012-01-12 5

Version 6.5 2012-09-21 2
Trip Advisor continually freezes up on my i-Pad..so I disengage and go to Hotel and Yelp...am returning less and less..too unreliable...dysfunctional...too bad because I actually find the app useful and easy to navigate.
Version 6.6 2012-11-28 5
Great for planning our Italy trip

Version 5.7 2011-07-26 5
Por enquanto estou muito satisfeito, esta me ajudando muito a planejar minha viagem de final de ano

Version 5.8 2011-10-11 4
Good app but should include hours seasons open and rates would make it perfect
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
I always consult this when traveling.

Version 6.1 2012-06-10 5
This app is really convenient(:

It's a little slow at times. and tends to crash. and freezes. but other than that, it's a great app!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-21 2
Prices in Pounds, although utilitarian for some, not for me. And my settings keep changing back. The information is good, but the app is not very user-friendly and keeps kicking me out

Version 6.4 2012-08-07 1
This was a great app, why ruin it?

It is now useless. Search is cumbersome and slow. If you want to see hotels you can't efficiently go back to select another in same city. It seems that you must start a NEW search just to get back where you were.

This is NOT an improvement!
Version 5.4 2011-04-17 5

No good for looking for hotels, if you type in a city to search you get all these other listings from irrelavant locations. Ok if you want to read reviews but for searching not good.

The app is pretty good for looking up info which I'm sure is its primary use case but it won't let me upload any photos from my iPhone 4S. It appears as if it's taking them but then they don't appear.
Version 6.1 2012-05-23 5
The trip advisor app is really a worth app that is worth downlading
Version 6.5 2012-09-28 3

App is just a slower, crashier , and buggy version of the website (it's literally the website wrapped in an app)

But more annoyingly is every time you go to the website you're told to get the app. Hint: I'm on the website because the app is terrible.

This app has been very helpful. You can get it & you won't regret installing it.
Version 5.91 2012-01-15 3
It has a minimal feature set, but it doesn't have all the features of regular site. For example, vacation rental tab is missing.
Version 5.93 2012-03-01 4
New 2 ipad, doing some exploring, TripAdvisor helpful & easy 2 maneuver.
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
Outstanding food, atmosphere and real Italian not a Italian want to be, worth the price I would suggest.
Version 6.2 2012-07-15 5
Easier to use the app than the website.
Version 6.6 2012-09-29 3
I would like the app to rotate based on how I use my iPad but otherwise e app is great
Version 6.6 2012-10-20 4
I love the app and love TripAdvisor... Not 5 stars because I don't want to sign in to do everything.
Version 6.6 2013-03-12 2
While the website is fantastic, the app is exactly opposite, slow and very limited functionality. I've deleted this app from my iPad.

Amazing app
Version 6.6 2013-03-01 3
This app needs some improving! I doesn't have all the features as online. I still rather go online to use trip advisor.

Really wish you could email the treasures that I find.

So far this site has saved a tremendous amount of time and booking hassles.
Version 6.1 2012-04-30 4

Love
This app, I always use Trip Advisor whenever I travel!
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 1
I've found that the Tripadvisor app is not updating forum posts in real time.  Also, it doesn't seem possible to post question/response using the app? Also doesn't display frequently asked questions like the web page.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-01 5
I don't know how nobody thought about this sooner!
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 4
Super helpful whether around your hometown or on vacay.

Fun to use for places I am thinking about visiting.
Version 5.3 2011-01-18 1
I use TA's website a lot and was very excited to have an app to use. Don't waste your time, use safari and select full site instead of thus app. Mapping results were WAY off from reality and the app won't show u an address so that u could use a decent mapping app to find what you're looking for.
Version 5.4 2011-02-17 5
An essential app for any traveler!!

Love it! My go-to source for planning a trip.
Version 5.9 2011-12-31 4
If you're on the go and want ideas for hotels or things to do its a great app. I use it regularly.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 2
You use to be able to filter out options and features at different levels.  This is no longer available and make the app not as worthy as it was.
Version 8.5 2014-03-11 4
Always a go to app when planning a trip.  It's helpful and accurate.

What a great help...real people with honest reviews wherever I am! I love it!

It's good for finding the blindingly obvious mass attractions and assessing their value, but not much more..
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 4
A generally useful app but some restaurant reviews are clearly self-reviews.
Version 5.0.1 2011-08-15 5
Never travel worldwide without it ! !

A must have while on the road. The "near me" feature is great!

Not really sure how people ever planned trips before TripAdvisor...... Get it!
Version 6.1 2012-04-12 1
I found the app frustrating to use. I couldn't see any offline mode and I couldn't copy stuff nso I. Used the web site and copied information into Evernote. It is painful that the website keeps asking me to download the crap app that I already have.
Version 6.3 2012-08-04 4
Good if you are going to a new place or want to find something new in your hometown.
Version 6.6 2013-04-12 4

A great app for spontaneous gateways or people who don't like to plan ahead
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 1
When you search for something and they don't have it in their database the only option you have is to add the place or completely close out and get back in it to go back to the search bar.
Version 5.7 2011-07-12 4
Really easy to offer feedback and easy to navigate!
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 4

Version 6.5 2012-09-21 1
This app crashes a lot on my iPad 3 running iOS 6. Very aggravating! 
Also, no access to my own acct and reviews!?!? You can't be serious!
I think it would better to use Safari so that you can access all the features of this site!
Version 6.6 2012-12-20 5
I love this app. I can write reviews in real time and on the go.

It's a great app when you need some hood ideas quick!
Version 5.92 2012-01-29 5
What a great app. And for the price $0, it's a "must have" app if you travel.
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 3
Tripadvisor has been accurate for places to visit. However not accurate for hotels.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 4
I love trip adviser! The app is pretty phenomenal. I can just rate hotels right from my phone.
Version 5.8 2011-08-19 5

Version 6.5 2012-09-14 2
Used to love this app. But whenever I need to make a search change (say flight date or airport) the app crashes and I have to start all over again!!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-21 2
The app is slow and laggy. Needs a lot of back-end work. Compared to Yelp or Facebook, this app is very poorly made. I expect much more from a leading public company.
Version 5.9 2011-12-11 4
I just put this on my I-Pad half hour ago, very detailed and easy to use.
Version 5.91 2012-01-20 5
Great tool for personal and business use!

Version 8.3.1 2014-01-06 3
The app is freezing every 5-10 minutes, and requires a forced close to restore usability. I'm using an iPad 2.
Version 5.8 2011-09-05 5
Great app to have when traveling!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-02 4
I find this easy to use and the information is up to date.
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 1
Will not update after reviewing and modifying flight data. Screen stays blank and green indefinitely. Wifi strength not the issue, strong home signal. Not sure how to correct the problem, but makes this app unusable. Delete and reinstall did not work.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-19 4
I'm trying to add a place to review on the app and it won't bring up the keyboard to type.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 2
Could be great, but needs work. Interface is klunky and slow, and when you hit the 'reviews' button, you get an "unsupported browser" message -- and then it suggests upgrading to IE or Firefox!
Version 5.8 2011-09-03 5
Does a great job. One of the " Go To" apps on your Iphone.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Use it all the time when planning or on a trip

Version 5.8 2011-09-19 4

I found Trip Advisor quite helpful in locating hotels and area attractions.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 1
Really need to know how far a restaurant is from my current location so that I don't hAve to take a cab from hotel or fight traffics. Would like to know what's near me.  

Too bad it has the makings of a great app!!!

Many places available on the actual tripadvisor website are not accessible thru the app! Not sure why but knowing this makes using the app an incomplete excercise which defeats the search purpose.

Everything you need in one app.

Clear, easy, accurate, informative.
Version 6.1 2012-04-03 1
Update now has bing map and only shows one item. Previous map would show all the nearest locations and your location. Please let us go back to old version. I think I'll have to delete if they don't fix it. Not very useful as is.

Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 1
No matter how many times I restart the app and apply so it sorts the results by rating, the app continues to sort the results by distance. Absolutely worthless to me when there are 700 results within 10 miles and I'm looking for the top 10 results.

Everything you like about the website, but the maps are terrible. Click to map a restaurant? You go to a terrible Bing map (redundant phrase, I know) from the 'Mars Lander' resolution. Get smart!

Best vaca/restaurant app out there!
Version 1.0 2008-07-26 1
First time I used it, was at home to see how it worked.  I travel a lot.  No matter where I am, I fire up this app, it takes a bit of time locating where I am, and then displays the same restaurant list it first gave me for where I live, never for where I actually am.  Total waste of an app.

Version 6.0 2012-03-15 1
This app was really great, however after the latest update, things got worse "force able landscape, flights feature removed..etc"

This app does not maintain state when you switch to another app and back. This is lunacy. After searching through the app, if you switch to, say, Chrome/Safari/etc. as part of your research then switch back, THE APP GOES BACK TO THE MAIN SEARCH SCREEN and not your last page. FAIL.

Very few hotels came up on my search in Winter Park, Co. The ones that came up appeared to have pictures taken by random patrons as if it was their FB site. I'm deleting this as soon as I finish this sentence!

Just moved to dc with kids in summer and looking for thing to do! Love this app!
Version 8.0 2013-10-12 2
Am I missing something? Since the update the restaurant reviews no longer have the restaurant website link or menus. That was my favorite part of the app.
Version 5.92 2012-01-28 3
Solid flavorings, nice presentation, but mahi mahi over cooked and dry, same for the red snapper.  There are better restaurants in Grand Case - L'Auberge Gourmande for one.

Like the feature, reviews and searches, wish I could do more account management

Version 6.6 2012-12-11 1
I love the iPhone app but on the iPad there's hardly any of the depth of info - I looked for restaurants near my resturant- heavy neighborhood but the nearest one the iPad app located was 5 miles away - on the iPhone, it's on the corner...
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-21 1
I am so sorry I downloaded the most recent update. I can no longer get to the home screen, even if I log out and log back in. Wicked bummer, because I used to use this app at least three times per week.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-28 1

Really like TripAdvisor's content, but really dislike this app on iPad.  Scrolling is slow and it loses track of your taps.  Feels like a web page rather than an app.

Simply put, TripAdvisor is THE GO TO APP for searching what you MUST DO IN ANY TOWN INCLUDING YOURS!!!
Version 1.0 2008-07-20 1
Really like the idea of this app.  However, was in Cincy two days ago and it still thinks I'm there.  Seemingly no way to correct this even after closing and reopening it multiple times.  Even a free app should do what it's designed to do.
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 5
A must have app use it before my trip to San Antonio TX info spot on.

New to advisor but seems fine for larger metro areas - not so good for smaller rural areas.
Version 5.7 2011-07-23 5
Trip Advisor is a great way to find a fantastic hotel.

Version 5.5 2011-05-03 5
Love it
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 1
Love the website but the app on the iPad does not work properly.  You find a place, ex Bunaken Islands it gives you three hotels. If you edit the filter to include other type of facilities it jumps to... Italy! Not very useful

This app is awesome...great for a picky g/f

Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
Good information
Version 6.2 2012-06-12 1
When doing a search locally, maps are unreliable and hotels that are near by do not show up. Makes one wonder about how reliable TripAdvisor is overall, if they can not get the basics sorted out like that!
Version 6.2 2012-06-20 5
Great App with lots of reviews & even a price search.
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 5

Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
I love this app! It is a must have for any family!
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 1
I find the new version for the iPhone unbearable. The switch to Bing maps which doesn't automatically fill in your current location and the destination of the chosen restaurant makes it to much of a bother to even use.
Version 6.1 2012-05-02 2
I visit mainly to see photos, but there is a bug viewing the photos, I go from viewing photo 13 to 14 back to photo 10... Looking forward to a fix

Great food & service hookah always hot
Version 3.0 2009-08-24 1
I checked two local restaurants to see what this app would say about them. The newer one was not even included, though it has been here for over 5 years. I am unimpressed, and have removed the app from my iPhone.
Version 5.9 2011-11-12 4
App is pretty useful but can be temperamental at times and crash on a iPhone 4S.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 1
Loved this app...would have been 5 stars, until I upgraded a few days ago and now....nothing.  Won't open.  Awesome. I had been loving checking out reviews and pictures of our upcoming honeymoon destination.  Wish I hadn't upgraded.

No websites or menus listed anymore plus when you go to read the reviews you can't just click on a terrible or excellent reviews you have to read them all.  I wish I never updated

One of the very best apps to have for traveling.

The app kept sending me to Narobi, Africa when I was actually in Rollinsville, CO.  Generally like the TripAdvisor website but found the iPad app annoying.
Version 6.6 2012-11-15 4
Could use some more photos of hotels and places from users.
Version 5.9 2011-12-16 4
This is a great aid in finding the best places to stay and eat while traveling.
Version 6.1 2012-04-11 1
Before the upgrade app worked well....after the forced upgrade the app has lost all it's value.  Many venues are excluded and many results are excluded from the results....does not provide the service it used to...poor upgrade

A search for restaurants in Las Vegas yields about 1,000, however the app only allows you to see reviews on a couple dozen. This renders the app nearly useless.

Road trip. Use it every step of the way!!!!

Version 6.0 2012-03-18 1
Why do they let idiots design updates?  This was a very good app before the most recent update.  Now, it only works in landscape and it crashes constantly.  What a stupid update.  Please revert back and leave well enough alone.  Morons!
Version 6.3 2012-07-17 2
App looks pretty, but navigation is difficult. Website has more functionality.
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5
Do I need to say more?
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 1
I have changed currency to local to see the prices and the app refuses to leave this currency back to $US. 
I have changed it back, reloaded and it insists on this on local currency for any hotel in the world.

On the spot info, reviews, and maps!

Version 6.6 2013-02-02 5
Lists by city, links to map. Love it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 2

Why does the facebook login require your life story. Why log in if you just want information. 10min in and just personal questions. Going back to the web and googling their forums.

They haven't even attempted to refine this app yet.  Keeps the list unorganized and does not update to new locations.  Pretty much useless at the moment.  I would pay for something that actually worked and had a couple features.

Just great,this app helped me find what to do on a Chicago trip.
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 2
The old app had way better functionality.  I can't even figure out how to add a photo to my review with the app.  I hate that it is in landscape only!  I really liked the old app.

The entire design of Trip Advisor is flawed.  I can't easily set a location or Trip destination and then search for activities based around that location.
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-17 3
Glad there is finally a tripadvisor app. But really needs hotel photos and would love to see the forums on here.

Trip advisor is a convenient app that is very handy
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 2
TA is obviously a great site for travel info and one that I visit frequently, but their iPad version is poorly designed and buggy.
Version 6.6 2013-04-02 4
Not a lot of functions and bad connection with facebook
Version 5.8 2011-09-10 4

Version 5.92 2012-02-22 2
I keep trying to find hotels near a convention center but TA keeps moving me to the center of the city and not near my meeting!  Very frustrated!  I will probably delete this app :-(

I love trip advisor and I love this app!
Version 5.93 2012-02-29 2
It's not buggy, but the design is terrible. 

In 2012 is not okay to just make things that simply "do the job." The consumer experience and design is REALLY lacking.
Version 6.1 2012-05-23 3
Great for last minute suggestions and for finding a good place o eat close to where you happen to be.
Version 5.5 2011-05-02 5
I love trip advisor use it before every trip!

Version 6.1 2012-04-02 2
I like some of the changes, but really frustrated with the map.  If I am searching hotels in a city, don't show me a map of the entire US that I then have to zoom in on!  Fix this!!!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-25 3
Good ole' Midwestern menu. Good but not great.

 Works for a hearty, inexpensive tastebud pleaser.

Version 6.2 2012-06-14 5

Version 5.0.1 2010-08-19 2
It's a shame you can't refine your search by "traveler rating" or "price per night", or "hotel class" as with the website.  This could/would be a great app, worthy of "5 stars".
Version 6.6 2012-11-10 3
iPad app doesn't list some restaurants, etc. that are on the iPhone app. What?
Version 6.6 2013-03-03 3

Highly useful

Very helpful on our vacation!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-01 5
Can't beat this app when on the road!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-24 2
I was hoping to replace Yelp and Foursquare with Trip Advisor. Disappointed I won't be able to. The deal breaker is you can't check in on a location.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-15 5
Does exactly what it's supposed to.
Version 5.93 2012-03-12 5
Great App. Very Helpful, wow we use it all the time.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 1
Was a great app, but no more!  Sometimes it shows only one hotel and a few things to do for major cities.  Had to look very hard to find hotels that I found on desktop version.  Go back to old version!
Version 6.2 2012-06-13 4
This app is great! Helped find great things to do while on vacation!

Version 6.1 2012-04-17 5
Great app...I use this every time I am going on a trip!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 2
Thy could have done a lot more with this app to get it closer the the web page features. Works well for what it does but then it does so little!
Version 6.6 2012-10-20 5
Excellent food great prices
Version 8.3 2013-12-25 2
The content is great. But it reacts slow when I'm trying to search some places. And it's very inconvenient to go back to the home page
Version 5.5 2011-04-27 3
This is a great service, but the site for mobil devices is not to my taste.  Skimpy, confusing, nade for dim users.
Version 5.6 2011-06-13 4
Good app
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 5
Does exactly what it advertises
Version 6.1 2012-05-23 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-06-13 2
This is a good looking app, but I can never find listings on it. Always get "no search results" where there should be thousands.
Version 8.5 2014-02-27 1
From the site on an iPad, it said to post photos, you must use the app from the App Store. I download the app, and you can NOT add a photo.
I will therefor delete the app from my iPad.
Also, can NOT visit your past reviews, or your profile. Double crap.
Version 5.8 2011-09-03 5
Accurate, thorough and easy to use.

Great information-good source.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 5
And very helpful!
Version 6.6 2013-01-13 1
Has a terrible HTML look to it, super slow, and not as detailed as the website. Maybe it's because I usually travel in Asia, but it would be much easier - and faster - to just use the website instead of the app!
Version 6.6 2013-03-16 5
What a great interface into Tripadviser
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 5
Fantastic advice.  Always spot on!

Very useful app on the road.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-02 1
This app is extremely buggy. At best, even when it's working, it's only loading web pages, which makes it very slow and not very responsive.
Version 5.2 2010-12-20 5
I love being able to take TripAdvisor with me when I travel - it has so much more than hotels and flights, so it's great to be able to access it during trips for things to do, restaurants, etc.

Easy interface and love the location-based advice!

Thank you TripAdvisor!

I regret the day I updated this app. The maps are shocking, streetview is gone too, so is the satellite view capability. 
Lift your game Tripadvisor. 
So sad they broke this app, I used it all the time, local and international...
Version 5.6 2011-05-25 5

Version 6.0 2012-03-23 3
The tool is a great start to help travelers plan their trips. But it looks like the tool is in it's infancy stage and does need lot of work.
Version 6.6 2013-02-27 1
This app is being deleted from my iPad tonight. Do I really have to reset my search criteria every time I use the back button?  The map locations are jus plain wrong. Start over, you guys.
Version 5.8 2011-10-23 3
Very useful during trip preparation and while you're at your destination!
Version 5.9 2012-01-11 5
Great app full of good information.

But close enough when you're on the go.

This app is very helpful when reviewing new travel spots.
Version 6.2 2012-07-10 1
It would let me search for flights until I selected  the " my dates are flexible" option. Every time it would pop up with an error message saying I needed to be connected to the Internet (which still I was).
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 2
The new app seems to be based on html5. While it's functional but it loads very slow and looks ugly.
Version 5.5 2011-05-03 5
Fantastic. Can't say enough about it's benefits

Love this app! Can't wait to take it on my vacations as well!
Version 5.5 2011-06-05 2
The map takes up a large fraction of the screen area, and the text is smudged to one side. If there is a way to change this, I could not easily find it.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Couldn't be happier, terrific UI. Great job!
Version 5.0 2011-08-11 4
No misses, yet ... new places to stay is the best feature.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 2
I like the old ones!!!!  That was more useful and the design was better than the new vision! I think 
The color green is the VI ! Don't like red and gray which sign the place out!

I'm in the middle of searching for a restaurant and you force me to upgrade to your new app? Now it won't find my location?
You guys are messing with a good app trying to make it better and made it worse.
I'm switching to open table!
Bye!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 2

I just love this app. Very detailed.

Version 7.0.1 2013-07-02 1
No user name is available even if using the most crazy made up thing ever. Everyone says it is unavailable, so not much use of an app if you can't get past the login.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 4
I use this app frequently-glad I found it!
Version 5.7 2011-09-10 4

Not loving it...miss the ability to view all locations within a city, not as grouped on the map.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
How we booked our first trip together!!!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 1
It has been a couple years and still VERY unfriendly to find your location again after initial search. So finding restaurants near you hard. Hate this enough to majorly ding it.
Version 6.1 2012-06-05 5
This is a great app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-02 3
To write a review was very good but more improvement of uploading photos will be needed

Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
I much prefer when TripAdvisor allowed Portrait view of the screen to the landscape screen  I now prefer to use Google to access the site rather than the app. Please fix it.
Version 6.4 2012-12-31 1
Love trip advisor but this app is really poorly made. Horrible user experience, especially the maps a pain to use. Impossible to use the location based search to find anything relevant.
Version 6.6 2013-01-01 4
I really trust the opinions of those who ave been there before me
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5

Very disappointing software, it is slow, it is buggy, some buttons, like the ones used to select and unselect favorite options do jot function at times...

Good app... Minimum length on review is a bit annoying

But needs more filters for restaurants etc.

This is a very much recommended app!

Can't believe how bad it has gotten since the update. Maps are horrible. Needs to go back to the way it was, much easier to get around then.
Version 6.4 2012-08-19 5

Version 5.7 2011-07-02 4
Very helpful in our beach vacation planning

Very useful and easy to use
Version 6.6 2013-02-01 1
They only want positive experiences.  When you try to write an honest, truthful negative review, it gets discarded. If you can't print both good and bad, then I have no use for trip advisor as they are being dishonest.
Version 5.5 2011-04-30 4
As always with TA, remember people's opinions vary greatly!
Version 5.6 2011-05-21 5

Would be better if it gave booking options for hotels
Version 5.1 2010-10-31 1
Doesn't have enough filters when browsing. Needs option to search within map. If you exit the program and come back to it, it clears your search info. Good concept, horrible execution.
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 4
Going to Vegas not for the first time, and with this app found totally new stuff.

Great app.... Wonderful for planning a trip to new places. The Forum rocks.
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 1
This seems to be just to checking reviews of hotels, but you cannot submit a review now comment on the reviews. I would rather use the full website then of that is the case.
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 5
Great app would recommend
Version 6.1 2012-04-18 1
It is impossible to set up the language. The app automatically chooses the language according to your location and provides horrible translations from English. Why is that? I want my app in English!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-13 5
Great for vacations and tours . Love the app :)

Cannot find b&b and hard to check availability. Have to use the web site...

Version 4.0 2009-12-09 1
Since the iPod Touch doesn't have a GPS, the app is unable to determine location and doesn't allow you to enter manually. So basically it doesn't work and they should list only the iPhone as compatible.
Version 5.6 2011-05-26 5
Enjoy using it!
Version 5.6 2011-06-26 5
Trip advisor is the best travel tool ever. Never bee led astray hotels, restaurants,
Version 6.6 2013-01-23 1
Too many clearly fraudulent reviews.  Do some research and discover that tripadvisor does a very poor job of following up on complaints. Impossible to actually speak to a person at TA.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-17 5
Love this app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 1
Restaurant was closed but a revue was written two weeks later saying they had just been there.  How many other reviews are wrong, fabricated or misleading?
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 4
Great very informative works well easy to use!

Version 7.1.1 2013-07-25 2
I wish Trip Advisor would improve their app. It's frustrating to use - can't filter easily.  Basically, the app is not intuitive.
Version 5.7 2011-06-27 5
Excelent for planning activities.
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 5
Use it all the time.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-21 1
A great way for former employees to attack businesses since trip advisor allows anyone to post whatever they want. Not a good way to tell anything accurate about any place on here.
Version 5.4 2011-07-24 5
Best to search before you go ...)))

Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
This has to be worst "upgrade" ever in the world. Take a perfectly fine and and completely ruin it - that about describes this "upgrade". Please fire the team that did this and get us an app that actually works!

This app needs to be repaired. I put in a town I was planning to visit, and it came up with a completely different location. On a another occasion I tried to find a restaurant list and it skipped places. I have uninstalled this app.
Version 8.4 2014-02-02 1
I love Trip Advisor and depend on it for great travel ideas. After I updated, the App won't open at all. Be careful about updating, especially if you don't have the newest OS. I now have no app access at all.

Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 1
I used to love this app until it stopped working on my iPhone 3GS. The app information doesn't say anything about what iOS version it works with either. I deleted it. Just lost me as a user!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-23 4
Really good for travelers but read all reviews to weedout bogus reviews.

As a reviewer this app is terrible to write reviews on the go. Plus there's not an option to add photos with the review. Tripadvisor needs to step up their game and update this.

(but i've only used a bit.)

Version 5.92 2012-01-29 5
Great site! Lots of help!

I usually like trip Advisor, but this app,,, ! cannot even find a quick and simple way to get rates. a total drag. i am going to have to use my desktop computer to figure out the details. This app is a bust.

Awesome and handy.
Everything at your fingertips.

Not intuitive, very confusing, you're better off Googling the topic you are querying and coming back into TripAdvisor via that link.

They are hurting themselves with this app.

Great help wherever you go.

This will be do convenient for traveling!
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 4

Using for d inner in Maui and recommendations are solid
Version 6.1 2012-04-12 1
The app itself is really good with a lot of useful info. But the translations into Danish of guest reviews are nothing less than terrible, the worst I have ever seen! This auto-translate feature ruins the whole experience.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-29 5
It's really very helpful app.
Version 8.0 2013-10-13 2
This app has serious performance and usability issues.  I often end up just going to the website.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 2
Disappointed I cannot customize my search choices as much as I can on Yelp. E.g. no brew pubs - only Cuisines.
Version 5.6 2011-06-21 2
Trip advisor forces use of app over safari on iPad.  Do not like that also insists on my location being on.  But does function.
Version 5.9 2011-11-13 4
Very convenient and user friendly
Version 5.93 2012-03-12 5
Perfect and very helpful thnx
Version 6.0 2012-03-25 2
OK for checking out stuff near you on a trip but lousy compared to logging into Trip Advisor for really accessing the site.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 4
Works well so far
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 4
I love this app... I helped so much, when planning a trip.

The app is awesome. Makes browsing easy!
Version 5.9 2011-12-13 5
Easy and quick. Thanks!
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 1
Too far from the main stream to be worth the trip!
We had: fried cod fish - too greasy; salmorejo=too much garlic; stuffed eggplant was ok but nothing to write home about and the service could be better!
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
Functional, easy to navigate

Handy app, easy to use...love it!
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 1
I knew a restaraunt to be 8 miles away, yet this app told me it was only 1 mile away. Add that to the fact that the painfully slow list can't be sorted by distance anyway, and you've got one awful app.
Version 5.9 2011-12-28 3
Vastly lacking in data... What is there works but only slowly...
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
Great site  really helpful
Version 5.5 2011-06-01 3
I like the app, but it seems slow and crashy...maybe I did not put enough RAM in this iPad....
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
Helped me find what I needed. And it has dun features.

This new version is terrible. Bing maps is worst Google. Don't have street view. The configuration window have zero options, I can't configure language. I want the previus version.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
Good info but mediocre app. Location services don't work even if enabled. Saving pages to Mysaves not working either. Can't find my map with all locations I have been in!!! That is REALLY LAME!

Version 6.6 2013-01-23 3
Please add landscape support for your fat-fingered users!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-02 1
I love this site. Although reviews on the same venue may vary, the trends are helpful. I've used recommendations with great success.  Trip Advisor is the first vacation planning site that I  consult.

Version 6.6 2013-04-25 1

Works as expected. No complaints so far!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 1
The latest update is terrible! It broke the ability to scroll around the map and have the map/list auto-update what attractions are around where you are looking on the map.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-17 5
Honest opinions on real experiences.
Version 5.9 2011-12-27 4
Very helpful travel guide. Reviews give an excellent idea.
Version 5.9 2011-12-28 2
Nowhere close to the real thing and I'm a tripadvisor-buff content-wise

Version 5.9 2012-01-02 3
The program is great, but it practically screams at you to rate it on this, so I am so it will shut up finally.
Version 6.3 2012-08-01 1
Can't login with Facebook: an error occurs, and then I just get my Facebook page. No retry, no back buttons. Disappointed :(
Restart application doesn't help as well

Version 6.0 2012-03-17 1
I do not find this update to be as easy to use, as efficient or as appealing as the previous app.  I don,t see any improvement and therefore have no idea why you would change it.  Big mistake!
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 5
Love love love it easy to use and fast!
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
The new TA upgrade is horrible. I have been a member of TA since 2004. I have been trying to use the new app all day and I cant run searches of city's I want to visit. This app must be fixed!
Version 6.4 2012-08-07 2

It's not very common for an ap to go backwards with an update but Trip-advisor did. The old ap was much better. And now I'm using kayak and hipmunk. Much better.

Just getting started but helpful so far.
Version 6.1 2012-04-04 1
This used to be a good app but not anymore... You can't add a place that is missing... If its not in here the app is useless! Second time today this failed me! It's time to delete it! One star only because you cant rate it a ZERO!!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-20 4
Great site. Takes the thinking out of what to do!

Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
Love the forum feature!
Version 6.0 2012-03-24 1
I do not like how the new app can only be viewed from a sideways view. It is always convenient when you are able to chose which way you would like to view an app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
Excellent coverage of Kyoto.

Version 5.6 2011-06-11 1
Many of the restaurants they list near me have been closed for a while. One address is correct but listed on the map in the wrong location. If it's wrong near me I certainly can't trust it on the road.
Version 5.6 2011-10-13 5
Use it every time we travel.

Seems like a good idea but the app is a real pain to work with. Trying to find restaurants near our hotel. App keeps hiding our hotel so I can se other hotels, but not ours. Giving up.

Honest reviews is what we all seek. This app has 'em!

Find attractions says location services aren't on although they are.  If you type location in yourself the search button does nothing.

The new update won't allow me to sign in. The screen just comes up blank when I click sign in. I don't want to sign in through Facebook. Help correct this please!
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 2
Takes too long to load. Once it's loaded, it works fine. I often return to mobile site rather than wait on this app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-15 5
Loving he changes

Wonderful
Version 5.93 2012-03-14 4

I can't really say how well this app works because I can't sign in to my existing account with TripAdvisor. The screen stays blank when I click on the sign-in icon.

Excellent! I feel like I on using the full site
Version 5.6 2011-06-18 5
Awesome better than website
Version 5.8 2011-10-04 3
Lacking hours and prices, "attractions" can be a tedious wild goose chase.

Very helpful app and really very good.

Good app but interface could be better.

It's a great concept, and love the ratings. It'd be a five if it was better polished.
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 5
Very easy to use. I use it quite often.
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 1
With the latest update this app has become absolute crap, difficult to navigate, cant add pictures, cant add a new restaurant. Not useful to me anymore, I move to urbanspoon.

Nice app! Very helpful
Version 6.0 2012-03-16 2
I agree with the other posters -- landscape-only is a major annoyance.

Plus -- why can't I log into Trip Advisor using my TA account info???
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
The update was a step back. It doesn't display all the hotels or restaurants, it limits you to a map cogerage area, it loads slowly. The older one was simple and easy to use.
Version 5.93 2012-03-03 4
A little clunky to navigate but does the job.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5

This is the travel apps that I use most
Version 6.1 2012-06-08 5

I wrote a review, tried to signin to complete the review, needed to reset my password. Came back to the app and it had lost my review.  Major fail.

Helps me decide while I'm traveling.
Version 6.4 2012-08-23 1
Horrible if you want to use on iPhone or iPad to look up friends. Don't waste space on your phone with this app. It got 1 star because I couldn't send the review with no stars.
Version 6.1 2012-04-18 1
New app is buggy, gets stuck.  You press back and it says no results.  Old version that used google maps was much much better

Use it all the time to get a feel for the area we are traveling to.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 4

I tried to get pricing from KTN to SEA and it said no flights are available.  There are several flights per day.  It appears to be useless for anything but major Metropolitan areas.

I hate this app, you can not even submit reviews (broken) with it. Rather get Foursquare or Yelp as the information is old and outdated.

Version 8.0.2 2013-10-23 1
I used to LOVE the tripadvisor mobile app but now it's completely USELESS. They removed the distance filter which means I get EVERY restaurant/hotel in a 50 mile radius...... Back to google.....
Version 5.7 2011-07-07 5
Excellent app!!!

Every update is worse than the last with this company.

UI is terrible and now we have a continuous never-ending looping login everytime I try and write reviews
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 1
This app is slow and buggy. Had to sign in twice to access my saves and then was not able to add new searches to saves (no save button). Don't waste your time with the app.
Version 5.7 2011-11-25 3

I like all the features of this app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-14 1
I have seen small insignificant restaurants take 1st rank with manipulations so I think this app needs to be monitored or not thought of as a credible reviewer
Version 5.7 2011-07-18 4
No guesswork...they have it covered!

Great for the frequent, or infrequent traveler.

This used to be a great app then, in the latest update, they replaced Google Maps with Bing Maps, which don't work most of the time. This app is useless to me if it can't show me the location on a map.

Why oh why did you "improve" this app so that it only works in landscape mode? I hate this new version, it runs slower and I really don't like having to use it "sideways". Please fix.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 1
Downloaded this app specifically to have the convenience of looking through pictures.. But the pictures dont show up. Must fix this!!

The new version does not permit viewing of traveler photos of hotels, which is one of the most important functions of Tripadvisor, in my view. Should return to the old version.
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 2
Glacier Wa has perhaps 200 residents and according to this app, 300 restaurants. I guess the app cannot be relied upon for accuracy.

Version 8.0 2013-10-06 2
Used to be a great app. With the removal of the "restaurants near me" feature I no longer can use it.
Version 5.6 2011-05-30 4
Great site. Easy to navigate and results are relevant and useful.
Version 1.0 2008-07-16 1
Poor database of restaurants. Interface scrolling is jerky- names double up. Same restaurant often listed several times under different food style.
Version 5.3 2011-08-07 2
Keeps taking me to "near me now" restaurants and won't connect to Internet while other apps are.  Frustrating
Version 6.1 2012-04-30 4
Easy to use and informative.
Version 5.6 2011-05-23 5

I tried to write a review of the New Mexico Railrunner train.  Seems like that has something to do with travel, but Trip Advisor has never heard of it so I could not comment.
Version 5.9 2011-12-21 4
I will know more when we use it more.

Ever since the last update, the app has barely worked!  I have an iPad original and used to use this app a lot.  Now, it barely works!  Please fix it!  :(
Version 8.2 2013-11-28 2
Can't figure how to sort by price. I will use another app to search for Hotels.

Version 6.6 2013-01-18 5
Awesome app for an awesome website.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-23 1
The App was dumbed down horribly with OS7, like it was using to much server memory so the cut all the rating nuance out.

Much less useful.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
Great app. Lots of good info. Easy to use.

No more save function after update
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-27 2
I hate that I cannot access full site features. Why make it so simplistic that I can't interact the way I want?
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-25 2
This used to be a very user friendly app, but now it is just frustrating.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
So glad there's an app for that now!

I want to use the iPad in portrait mode and not be forced into landscape. Don't like the new 6.0/6.1 version. I will use the website instead.
Version 6.1 2012-06-09 4
But the app isn't bad.
Version 6.0 2012-03-17 1
We almost always used the iPad in portrait mode, just like reading a book. Now we have to turn it side way to use this app! Dumb idea. Should at least give use the option!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
Just dropped a very carefully written hotel review when I pressed "submit" after finishing - claiming the server couldn't handle it! LOTS of work down the drain. AAAARGH!

There does not seem to be any way to search or view Bed & Breakfast lodging options from the iPad app. 
Is Trip Advisor going hotels only?
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 2
Needs some work. Can't drill down to a restaurant location then easily return to list

So far not impressed by the app.  Culd not find a restaurant by rating or alphabeti.  Will probably get rid of the app and go back to Internet site.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 1
I used the old tripadvisor app on an almost daily basis until the recent update.  It's difficult to use and navigate and so I just stopped using the app.
Version 6.1 2012-03-30 2
It can't find many attractions on the map.  It reports hundreds of hotels, etc. on St.. Maarten/St. Marten and only shows/finds 20 or so of them.

The mobile website is better than the App. This has bad UI, can't search for hotels when selecting a region. It only shows random picks.
Version 5.9 2011-12-07 1
Trip advisor is somewhat worthless, I had to go find my own tickets between Mesa Az and Wichita, Ks.  This App could not even find Allegiant Airlines. Save your money...

I am amazed by its facilities.

Don't be honest with your review on TripAdvisor they don't like it so what's the point.
Version 5.4 2011-04-20 5
Some small limitations, but it's awsome
Version 5.6 2011-06-09 5
Says what it does, and does what it says!

Reviews are stupid things! People write on stuff that they don't even know and threat businesses if they don't get what they want! These apps shouldn't exist!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-05 1
I would rather use the website on my iPad, the app links to the we page and makes it difficult to navigate.
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 5
This is exactly the app I need.
Version 5.6 2011-06-15 5
It's a great resource for traveling!

Great app! No complaints yet.
Version 2.0 2008-08-01 5
I have used the web version of Trip Advisor for a long time which has also saved my butt when travelling from different countries and needed a place to stay last minute. So finding this "local picks" app was pretty cool when I found it. Too bad it doesn't do hotels and what not as well or other services and just local places to eat. Anyway, when I found this, the reviews ripped it apart and I was swayed from ever downloading this. I mean there is YELP, WHRRL, Yellow pages, etc out there, why would I install an app that was 1 to 2 stars the most.
Version 3.0 2009-07-12 5
Simple yet very effective app from one of my favorite sites: tripadvisor.com. I use it on my itouch and it's great within wifi coverage. (Don't know how those who criticize it expect it to give up to date info unless it can get online each time! Duh!) I will give it a good test this week in Vienna, Austria!  So far, I love it
Version 3.0 2009-09-04 5
I found this on BuyingPower.com!  Thanks!
Version 5.0.1 2010-09-02 3
Since Yelp doesn't work outside of the U.S. Tripadvisor is our go-to app. Sadly, no pics or ability to upload them. And we won't be able to add them until we return state side, as we only brought out iPhones and iPad.
Edited to add: a section for shopping would be a great addition!
Version 5.2 2010-12-18 5
The map to the right is too large and the reviews on the left column would be easier to read on the right hand side and in a much wider column.  Disappointing.
Version 5.2 2010-12-26 4
Would give 5 stars if they allowed bookmarking. Besides that, I love Trip Advisor!
Version 5.2 2010-12-28 1
Keeps asking for location services on my iPod touch...maps can find my location, why can't this app?  FIX IT
Version 5.2 2010-12-30 4
Really useful!
Version 5.2 2010-12-31 5
Translates well to ipad app. Now I'll have access close at hand.
Version 5.2 2011-01-11 2
Not very useful though... Haha but amusing.
Version 5.2 2011-01-14 3
It is a well designed app however I was looking for a tool to provide timeshare resort comparisons. I needed an app to compare the benefits of my timeshare-alternative.com verses the retail timeshare marketplace. Hopefully, they will add more timeshare resorts. 

Thanks
Version 5.3 2011-01-16 2
The web app interface on the left side of the screen is ugly and hard to navigate.

Also, when on the map after you've searched for a hotel, you can't move around and look at the area on the map because it'll move you back to the first hotel that was found. Fail.
Version 5.3 2011-01-16 4
It's a good app but I wish I could log in under my user account and save favorites.
Version 5.3 2011-01-17 1
As a fan of tripadvisor website, I was so disappointed. 
-The tool doesn't remember the latest search, so if you want to search other things for the same dates or the locations,you have to enter them over and over again. 
-It kicked me out several times because it crashed. 
-I was reading reviews in the car and my network connection was suddenly gone. It popped a message saying that it could not work without network and kicked me out of the app. It was so annoying!
Version 5.3 2011-01-21 3
I love trip advisor but it would be nice to have a favorites tab, so I don't have to continually search for places/things to do. 

Will give 5 stars when I see that feature if it's at all possible
Version 5.3 2011-01-23 2
I was hoping for an easy way to search reviews but there was not even a way to search at all.  I really only wanted this feature.
Version 5.3 2011-01-24 1
Does not work with first gen iPod touch
Version 5.3 2011-01-24 3
Not nearly as good as the TA website, trying to post a review is a nightmare. It has you write the review first, THEN log in. If you have trouble w login, your review is seemingly lost in cyberspace. SO AGGRAVATING!!!  Yes, repeat search feature is missing, and maps are not what they should be. Needs a LOT of work!!!
Version 5.3 2011-01-24 3
I tried it here in Kuwait and its pretty good

Going to Paris next week inshallah and I hope that will help me there
Thnx
Version 5.3 2011-01-27 2
I just tried the trip advisor app. I typed in the exact name of a lodge I was looking at on the trip advisor website and the app can't find it. Not exactly efficient.
Version 5.3 2011-01-29 1
I don't want the map all the time!  Cumbersome and hard to use.  I will stick to the web version.
Version 5.3 2011-02-05 3
Nice BUT it is limited on hotels, other app's will show at least twice the number of hotels on map. Sorry but I went elsewhere !
Version 5.3 2011-02-05 3
I like that's it's easy to look things up in a format that fits well on the iPhone. There is a lot of info and maps etc. My biggest problems, which is why it didn't get a higher rating and if they would fix it I'd give it 5 stars, is that if you close the app for just a few minutes it makes you start a search over. It would also be nice if it would remember recent searches. One other nice to have would be to be able to flag a hotel or something that you may want to visit or look up more info on later. Right now I have to do screen shots to remember. It would be nice if you could then sort these by trips and it would be available then on the website.
Version 5.3 2011-02-06 2
I love TA and use it all the time.  However I am disappointed with this app because I can't save anything or even email myself a link.  So when I find something interesting it is frustrating.
Version 5.3 2011-02-06 1
I got this app because i love the website, it is my favorite and the only one that i use to find cheap flights. the thing is the app that i got don't have the flights search engine. I just can search hotels, restaurants and things to do. ):
Version 5.3 2011-02-10 5
Wow todd, good app
Version 5.3 2011-02-15 3
overall this app does what i want and expect.  However please fix the constant barrage telling me to download the app when I already have it!  I receive email updates about my chosen destinations, very nice. When I click within the email to find out more information it goes to the website and hits me up to download the app, very annoying.  I already have it downloaded.  Make the email notices and app work together.
Version 5.3 2011-02-16 3
It's a decent app, but you need a way to filter hotels alphabetically as well as search for a specific hotel.
Version 5.4 2011-02-17 5
Great app! I like it better than the www site.
Version 5.4 2011-02-17 5
Loving the app. Simple to navigate, brings the best of tripadviser to my iPhone!

First, very good street view integration; perfect use of device location & context for a travel app.
Version 5.4 2011-02-17 5
Probably my most useful app. Well designed too. I literally don't leave home without it. And the more critical reviews make for the most entertaining reading. Trip advisor performs a very crucial function for the traveller. Join now!
Version 5.4 2011-02-17 5
My favorite app out there!
Version 5.4 2011-02-17 5

Great to have the best travel review site as an app. Very usable interface.

Immediately deleted this app because it was useless.  For some reason it kept saying I was offline so it would not work.  Looked good, just wouldn't work.

I live in San Diego and tried searching restaurants out at my location. First time using the software and 4 of the restaurants on the first page listed were closed. Some of the restaurants have been closed for over 3 years now.
Version 5.4 2011-02-18 5
What an awesome app to have!!  So nice to see where to stay and visit while traveling before you even get there.  I am impressed with all the information.  I do wish you could save your favorite searches like the other reviewer had said but still an AWESOME app to have if you travel.
Version 5.4 2011-02-18 5
can't say enough wonderful things about the TripAdvisor, great application.
Version 5.4 2011-02-18 5
Excellent app - Don't leave home without it!
Version 5.4 2011-02-18 5
I really like trip advisor and use that site all the time.  So having an APP for my iPad is wonderful!
Version 5.4 2011-02-18 5
This is a good app for the phone.  I was happy to see that trip advisor had an app for the phone because I really think the full website is a very useful tool.  Reading the reviews on places gives you a heads up on what to expect.  When you read all positive reviews about a place then you feel better about going.  If you read all negative reviews then that is definitely a flag to stay away.  If you read mixed reviews then it may or may not be something to try.  It helps because you are not going in blind.  Thanks to everyone that takes the time to give a review on different resorts, restaurants and all other general helpful tips.
Version 5.4 2011-02-18 5
Most apps are not useful, but this is the exception.

Very nice tool preparing for vacation
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 3
Shows a lot of different restaurants including local favorites! Wish the airlines for flight included Southwest though. However, it is convenient, clean, and user friendly  A good app to have!

I have the iPad app, & my first time using it, I found the #1 rated restaurant in the area within seconds. It didn't disappoint. This place was 20 min from our house & we had never been there & it was incredible! This app is so easy to use.
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 5
The app that everyone MUST HAVE
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 5
Wonderfully helpful app! Loaded the app while on vacation in Florida - wished I loaded it at the beginning of our vacation!
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 5
One of my fav apps. I love the trip advisor website. This app makes it easy to check forums and reviews. Right now I'm counting down a trip to Mexico, so I'm obsessed with it!
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 1
I was very surprised how inaccurate the business listings are. I tested the app and looked at restaurants near my home. About 20% are flat out wrong. They list a business that has been out of business for years. It doesn't list many of the new and upcoming businesses. There is no crowd sourcing ways to flag errors which is surprising since they invented this.

Unfortunately, Yelp is better in the states. I serious question this information when I travel abroad. I would hate to plan an activity trusting this info to show up and find it completely wrong.

Btw, the UX is neat. I like the general design and layout.
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 5
Used it on our trip and it never let is down! :)
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 5
Tripadvisor is a fantastic source of real information for any traveler.  Whether it's a restaurant I want, a B&B, an activity, or even a beach, I trust this website and app to give me accurate timely reviews from travelers like me.
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 5
Best trip app for the iPad I have used. It beats kyaak and expedia hands down. I just wish flights to Paris in July were cheaper ;)
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 4
I find the app great for those last minute emergencies where I need to plan setting and don't have time for my own research.
Version 5.4 2011-02-19 5

Version 5.4 2011-02-19 4
Very useful when you're on the road. The reviews are becoming more and more comprehensive, making Tripadvisor an essential companion for traveling.

Very handy app. Helped me find a great local restaurant in no time.
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 4
Very convenient, good interface. Would love a button so I can easily email a review or the name of a place to a friend.
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5
As a long time trip advisor user love the way this is optimized for iPad. Thanks

So easy to use! Great for searching new vacation ideas or looking for places close to home. Fun to use even for the armchair traveler!
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5
I have been using Trip Advisor (TP) for years. It is one of a kind. Everything you need to know about your destination (almost everything) is here. In my field (healthcare) we call it "evidenced-based" (EB) and TP is EB travel. Read the reviews and you will definitively find details that you need to know. Good job guys!!!!!

I've used the web version for years. The iPad app will now be my preferred choice. Using Trip Advisor has helped me find the right places to stay and enjoy our vacations.
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5
Been using for several years now, as we like to try new, hi-end places. Choosing between destinations, and between where to stay at that destination, is accomplished for us by reviewing the Trip Advisor reviews from other discerning travelers who have gone there ahead of us.  People who take the time to write a review are usually very informative, and caring.  We will never take a trip without checking the reviews on Trip Advisor -- even if we have been there before (as things sometimes change).  The photos people contribute with their review are also very valuable....a picture tells a thousand words as they say. Lastly, I respect that often times the hotel management will also look at these reviews (sometimes they even post responses), as this tells me they are striving to listen, and adapt.
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5
Makes vacation planning so much less stressful and very easy to use!
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5
I wish more apps were like this.  No login required to write reviews. No nagging.  Clean interface.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
The folks at Tripadvisor never cease to amaze me. I never go anywhere without first checking my hotel and "things to do" list with them first. Their service is a much loved tried and true industry standard, which this app reflects! Thank you Tripadvisor for many successful years of European travel.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 4
I have really come to rely on this app!  It is so handy to have on hand when in a location that you are not intimately familiar with!

My husband and I have been on a road trip for 17 days (so far), this app has proven to be invaluable for finding good, clean hotels at great prices.  We even found an amazing king suite in Hollywood for about 50% less than crummy hotels in the same area, incredible!  I highly recommend this to anyone planning a trip, whether near or far!

It'd be nice if the authors would take a little more pride in the app. Back buttons don't always work. If you filter on a particular category you can view the first 20 items returned, but trying to page beyond that results in removing the filter conditions. I recommend that you avoid the frustration of this app - try a different source for your travel information needs, at least until the app authors bother testing and fixing their bugs.

I really love Trip Advisor for searching hotels, but when I brought up the app, it found my location and was on the restaurant tab. The listings are horribly out of date (which I reported). Restaurants that have been CLOSED for years were on there, but their replacements, some of which have been OPEN for years were not. If TA is going to list restaurants, you should make a better effort to list CURRENT restaurants.

The perfect personal assistant.

Nice app for a quick reference of what you do. The feature to look for things near you is terrific!
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 4
I luv this app I think most people will like it too
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 3
I like the app but do not appreciate the reminder to rate every time I login. Had to ding the app for the unnecessary persistence..
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
I was traveling in Southeast Asia without having done any research. My trip was sudden and simply unplanned. I used Trip Advisor all the time, especially to find places to stay. I never went wrong using it for accommodations.
I would recommend it to any traveler!
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
Great counsel. Helps to plan.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 4
It's nice and easy to use so far. This is 4th time it's asked me to rate in 5 mins of using so that was annoying
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
I love the forums.  You can find out so much valuable information.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
Increible app! Buenisina!
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 4
Love this app. I used TA online and this gives me 100% of the functionality that I use the most on the website.

When you're planning and researching for multiple stays it would be very helpful if they let you bookmark places. Without that tool it means I carry scraps of paper to help me remember the places I might want to stay. This I why I'm giving 4 stars not 5, otherwise love.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 3
Great site. App is ok but not great. Do u really care?
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 4
This is a fantastic app. However, it lacks the ability to select the places you want to go and map a route. If that were to come in an update, 5 Stars hands down.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 4
Overall an awesome app. The only complaint is that the restaurants need to be updated. Found some on the list that were no longer in business. Adding some weather info might make this app perfect. Still, definatly worth the download.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
Website and app are great. You have to read ALL reviews and keep in mind everyone is different. Take reviews with a grain of salt. Mainly accurate, but don't hesitate to go against the grain.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
This is so convenient and helpful. I use it all the time.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
Is a very good app. I use it alot. I only wish that you could sign-in from the app to your tripadviser account.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
I love TA! I use it constantly for everything. I trust the info. It helps me decide among all the" too much info" out there!
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
This is a must do as far as researching vacation destination. App works great especially the seamless use of maps. Great app!

This app is great if you plan on traveling. Any questions that you have are answered promptly.

This app is great for traveling and finding restaurants and such close to home.  Just planned a trip for several weeks from now including air & hotel, and found a restaurant near home for tonight...all in the same app in a matter of minutes.
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 5
I love this app.

Haven't had it too long but so far it has been real helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 5
I am going to Rome this spring and downloaded this app to help me. I  could not believe home much info is chalked into this little app of joy! Every detail or question that you may have about a destination is all here... in one cute little buttoned up power house of a personal travel agent.  Use it for your home town too!  You will be suprised at the treaure trove that you never knew existed!
Makes me feel 100% at ease with being in another country.
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 5
Don't leave home without it.  Also remember, you can't please everyone all the time.  What one person thinks is a major problem is a minor glitch to others and viewed as part of the journey.  Having owned several restaurants, I have seen all types of personalities.  With this in mind, read the reviews.
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 4
Easy to find and search..
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 5
I travel all over North America, Europe and Asia. I reference this app every time.
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 3
Based on the design and interface alone, and that it' s free, it is a potential 5 star app.  However, there was a rather glaring error on my very first usage, so until it proves to me that this glitch in the algorithm is fixed, I won't be able to rely on it.  I have reservations in NOLA at Hotel Monteleone, so  I looked it up.  It's my first trip to N.O., so I was not exactly sure where this hotel was, except I knew it was in the heart of the French Quarter on Royal Street.  When I clicked "show on map," it dropped the pin and hotel info about a mile away from the area where I knew the area of the hotel was.  A little panicked at first, I went to another site to confirm exactly where the hotel was.  I then examined what could have caused the problem within the app, and it was quickly apparent.  The app "interpreted" "Royal Street" to mean "Rue Royal," which is the French name for Royal Street.  However, and it's a little bizarre,  but the area of the French District has both a Rue Royal and a separate street spelled in the common English of Royal Street.  This may have been a 1 in a 1000 occurrence, but since it was my first usage, I have to wonder.  I'll change my review to 5 stars if I use it for a while and have no similar issues, because as I mentioned, this app is very slick, and everything else about it is a 5 Star design.

My wife and I are spending a month in Venice, FL and have been using Trip Advisor extensively to find good local restaurants.  Without this app we certainly would have been stuck in some pretty lousy places.  Thanks for a very useful application.

. . and it's the same one mentioned by others. Sometimes the map gets fooled by, well, who knows what. Planning a trip to Italy, I hit the MAP button for my hotel in Manarola and it puts it in the wrong town.

Generally, this is a very useful travel planning resource, as is the iPad version. The hotel reviews have been most helpful in knowing which ones to avoid!
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 4

I've been researching a property that has 500+ reviews and want to read them at various times on my iPhone or iPad. 
Every time I close the app I have to then a spend major amount of time looking for where I left off. Isn't there anyway this app can save a page, location, hotel or anything? A bookmark to the exact page that was last visited or "favorites" would be SO helpful. The reviews by visitors are so helpful.

First started use of app in Barcelona while traveling alone with my kids. Very helpful in finding good restaurants near our hotel.  Would love to have this sync up with my phone version of the app, so I can "research" on the iPad and take the info with me on the phone.  Also, have it "connect" with google maps for easy directions.  Would recommend it as an essential tool for travelers.

This ap is excellent. I live in a metropolitan city and I find that this is the best go to city guide for me when I want to behave like a tourist. The ap is no frills, simple, loads easily, is not buggy, and is very well laid out, making it a true favorite. Other companies should take some tips from you guys. Perhaps TripAdvisor should add a second vertical to their business model and become a mobile developer. Mobile is the future and they've certainly got IT! Well done.

I struggled a little bit finding the hotels when I was trying to research them while I was on my trip. Would be nice to have a way to integrate with the GPS better. I'd admit I'm a novice so maybe I haven't figured out yet. 

Even though I started out negative, I've always gotten a lot out of the app and website! Written from people you can trust and the ratings across multiple reviews is always spot on!
Version 5.4 2011-02-27 5

Very helpful. I have used the web version for years and this is just as useful.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Trip advisor is helpful. Great way to to read reviews
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Have used Trip Advisor for years and love that it's now available as an app! If you're a traveller you need this app!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 4
This app is very useful, although slightly tougher to navigate than the regular desktop version. The mapping feature works great. Trip Advisor saves the day.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
It rocks!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 3
app shows only a fraction of the available lodging shown on the website.  must be the ones who pay for placement that get this treatment--I feel it is less satisfactory for that reason
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 4
Love the app, but don't like that it assumes that I am always looking for something near the location I am in.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 4
Very helpful app
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 4
Easy to use, and quite helpful. It would be nice to have a trip planner, something to organize of the great information provided through this app.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 4
Me encanto esta app gracias muy completa!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 4
Good for the lazy traveler who doesn't want to spend a bunch of time doing research or getting guide books.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
great app. does what it says and does it well.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Easy to use...I love using the flight info!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
A-maze-ing!!!!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Very easy to use. I actually prefer the app to the real website now. I also love that I can post directly to the site from my iPhone.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Easy to use.  Helpful.  Accurate.  Does not crash.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 4
Planning a trip to cabo, it's been a huge help in getting ready!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
During our 10 months of travel through Asia and SE Asia we have used this iPad app, and written reviews, to help us decide where to stay, what to see and where to dine. I especially like the 'where we are now' GPS feature. An indispensible travel aid.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Very easy to use and fast
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 4
Use it often. Great when out of area.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Love this app! Extremely helpful!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 1
I can not get this app to work on my iPad. Whenever I try to find something near me I get "location services are unavailable", and location services are indeed enabled for the app. I can not even get a response from the app when I type a city name. The support website is no help at all.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Downloaded this app while in Puerto Vallarta.  Found great places to eat and awesome attractions. If you travel, this app is a must have!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
I am a Travel agent and this app is far better than many others we use. Now that I found it, I can't live without it. Helps me getting much more information that the hotels themselves say. The other consumer's opinions are very valuable and I take them most of the time into serious consideration.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Easy to use and incredibly helpful, this app is fabulous.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Great app!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Nice app to have handy if you're planning a trip.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
No need to go to computer all information is right at your fingertip!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Handy on the IPod plus it's the trip-advisor, the bible to my travel!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Love the "near me" feature. Easy to use. Very responsive. Can't beat it for free
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Does what it is supposed to do all the time. Love it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
Planned our whole San Juan vaca thru this thing and it was excellent!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
Stuff that's good to know
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 3
Little slow, but good.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
For free, it does what it needs to.  Wish it had a fare alert though.  Would make 5 stars
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
I just started using this app and plan to try it next month when in Brazil and Argentina. I checked out the local restaurants and other milestones and they are very well defined location wise. I will be able to give better review in a month.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
One of my favorite apps
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
A very useful app if you can learn to discern the real reviews from the fake.  I try to read all the reviews for any particular place and average them out.  I always ignore the ones that recommend another establishment within the review as I know several business owners who have written disparaging reviews to puff themselves up (sad but true).  Posting particular items tried is very helpful as are the tips about peak time service.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
I like it a lot
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
Awesome. What else to say??
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
It's my first go to tool for planning local and destination visits!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
I love this app especially when I'm out of town and need to find a decent hotel. If you rely on reviews to decide where to stay then this is a great for you. Also, if you want a way to write quick reviews, you found the right App.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
Wouldn't go anywhere without checking it out on TripAdvisor.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
So useful ...
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
I always check out the reviews on TA before staying anywhere!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
I really like this app as an extension of the full website I can carry with me on my iPad.  The single enhancement I would love is the ability to remember where I was in my last session.  Whenever I close the app and come back I have to drill back into a very specific forum or hotel search.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
Thanks guys, your product is just awesome!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
Great app!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 2
I would give it 5 stars but I mostly use Tripadvisor for the hotel reviews, which are given a small space in this app. Here you are browsing the hotel info in this narrow window, while the map takes up almost two thirds of the display! I can't figure out how to customize this (make map smaller), if the feature exists at all.. Also, there is no street view in PR, so what's the point of the map really?

I prefer to use the safari version, where I can adjust the size of the reviews to my preference and read comfortably for hours..
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
Great app
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 2
Needs filter for pet policies.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
Really great for flights & love the prices
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
Looooooove it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
Wouldn't be able to book spring break without it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
I always use Trip Advisor.  The app is pretty good nut it is not as functional as the full website.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
Overall we have used this app while traveling, and it has been very useful.  I wish it had a place to save favorite things when searching.  I am always scrambling for a pad of paper and a pen to write myself notes. I'd like to be able to save a bunch of ideas in the app and then string them together into an itinerary with a map feature.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
Good
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
Still great!  Even as an app.  Same performance and info.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
Best place to go hungry and leave happy with quality and good price
Version 5.3 2011-03-02 1
Crappy app from an even crappier company.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
Could use a main link to forums. That is what I use most.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
This is an awesome app love it
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
Greatttt
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 3
This a very nice hotel. Its clean, new and very big. The only con is the location. All the food is a mile or more away and its surrounded by distribution facilities which brings in a lot of trucking traffic.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
Excellent, way above average app best 
App i have used
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
This a great app and its really useful for, on the go. I didn't put 5 stars because I think it needs a bit of updating and making it a bit more "MODERN" kinda look.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 3
I just recently downloaded this app. We travel quite often and want to use it to locate mostly motels and restaurants. I like the way it works and will be using it often! Maybe adding gas stations would be a great feature!
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
Probably the best travel app you'll find in the app store....
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
I enjoy the Trip Advisor web site and this has all the content without the clutter.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
This app lets you skip the stuff you should miss and helps you find great hotel rates.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 3
I've been checking out local places on this app and I am running across places that have been closed for 10 years or so. That being said I wouldn't it use this app for restaurants without calling ahead to make sure they still exist.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
Very easy to use and insanely helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
I didn't know about tripadvisor till about two years ago.  But ever since I've started using it religiously my trips have been much easier to plan and better overall.  You know where to go and when with this app on the go.  This is a must have if you travel or just love to eat!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
Beautiful and smart UI for iPad. Highly recommended.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
I love trip advisor. It's an excellent tool for reference before traveling. It offers so many details, recommendations and ideas. A must have app!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
Love it. I used it while on a long drive to work on my summer vacation. Just wish they can create a tab for vacation rentals in addition to hotels.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
I can easily review all the hotels I would find on the website and also review the hotel on my iPhone as soon as I check out.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
I've been using the site since a friend recommended it to me a few years ago when planning my trip to Paris/Rome and I've never looked back.  When the app became available I had to have it, so convenient and easy to use. I highly recommend it.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4

Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
Great way to find great hotels when in unfamiliar territory. Nice app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 1
1 the green background makes text hard to read--the green background even when you leave to check rates on expedia.

2 you can't enter dates until you pick a hotel; therefor you can't see a list of hotels available on your dates.

3 there is no forward button

4 the back button doesn't take you back to trip advisor from the offsite places where you're checking prices: I checked a hotel; it wasn't available; I couldn't go back; so I had to select home and the search all over again. Not worth thevtrouble.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 2
I don't like that there aren't as many search options as the full site. I'd like to be able to search for hotel availability and link to websites to book reservations. I'd also like to search vacation rentals, not just hotels.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-03 5
Good app If you need info on the go.   As good as the website?  Not quite, but great to have in your pocket.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 3
I used this app to find fun things to do in Chicago. If you're looking for a full function TripAdvisor, you're better going to the website. This app is a nice, responsive abbreviated version of the website. It still has reviews, location, maps, and suggestions. An accurate and well designed app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 1
Like I said.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 5
Used it to plan my trip to Texas to visit my bf, and the reviews for everywhere to eat were exactly how I felt. Love this app!
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 4
Like the app, good info source
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 4
Trip Advisor is a great website, and will help ensure you make good decisions for your trip. I have just started to use it on my iPad, and it has been a good experience too.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 5
Wish that I could access my past reviews but everything else is great.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 5
I love this app. It's great for planning your next trip.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 4
Trip Advisor is a handy travel too and has been well integrated with the iPad features and interface.  Please work on the compatibility with app switching.  Trip Advisor seems to do a complete reload when you return to it from another app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 4
Find good deals in all major areas. Recommend this app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 3
useful
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 5
Great "in your pocket" version of trip advisor... Perfect for road trips and when you're traveling abroad and don't have access to your laptop!
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 1
Search will find locations in other cities, no good.  Cannot save locations.
Version 5.4 2011-03-03 5
Not sure what the bad reviews are about. I'm using it on my iPad (Jan 2011 version of software) and it's fantastic. Much better than the website.

I would like to be able to see the places I've reviewed in a history tab, and be able to save favorites, also be able to share the location. It would be great if I could post my review on facebook. Thank you.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 4
So far so good...this ap has given me everything I wanted from it....others expect to much...it's not a concierge
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
This is a pretty helpful app to say the lease. We work hard for our money and it's nice to be able to preview businesses from people who have their view points.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
This app is important for anyone who loves to travel
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
Great app so far. Mostly writing a review in hopes the constant reminders to write a review will disappear.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
Highly recommend
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 2
App is slow, doesn't keep track of what you were last looking up, and has a very poorly designed UI. It just feels like they didn't know what they were doing when they wrote the app. They should closely examine how apps like maps and mail work, and try again.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
I'm a frequent traveler and trip advisor user. This app has been very helpful when I'm nowhere near a desktop or my laptop. Great job!
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 4
Very cool app to find things like flights for holidays.

Helped me make a choice on my honeymoon!
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
This app is the one we use to make decisions when we travel. We don't eat or go to attractions unless it is rated by the trip advisor.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
This app has great detail.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
The only issue is there is so much information, I get bogged down by the choices!
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
Fantastic app. Fantastic site!!!!!

Great while traveling and also able to use the gps.

Easy!! Accurate!  5 S*T*A*R*S
Love it!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
I love it because I travel so much! Just wish this app included phone numbers because having to book on line is hard when trying to hurry up and get it done while traveling.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 3
LOVE the website but this app keeps giving me +1 day with no area to adjust times. If I wanted the next day I would have put the next day! I didn't select flexible dates either. The website let's you adjust the departure and arrival times as well as number of stops and duration of layover. Please add that option to the app!
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
This site gave me info that did not show up in a google search. 
Gives really great insight to lots of destinations.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 3
So far, so good.

My go-to app for vacation planning
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Great app to use on the fly and on vacation. Times are busy...  Love that it's integrated with my location so I can research dinner options while lounging by the sea mid day. :) recommend
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 2
I like the app and the info provided but what's frustrating is that I've submitted several reviews which were never loaded onto their site. I'm not sure if they're screening these or it's just a poor process, but it skews the results making me question how representative of reviews this site really is.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Awesome
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
I like it better than the website; easy to use and I like how the hotel website appears in the nav frame instead of opening in a new screen.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
I downloaded this app while planning a motorcycle trip for my 6yo daughter and I. What a great way to plan some fun things to do along the way!
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
Good not great
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Wonderful for a iPhone or anything similar.  My family camp quite a bit, great for your toolbox
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
Nice features.  The forums could be improved. Sometimes I have to scroll thru the same reviews to see something on pages other than the first
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
We use this app all the time.  Great information, especially when in new areas.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
There are so many options for travel and lodging but you don't really know what you will end up with until you experience it. Then it can be too late and you've ended up with something you don't want. Anywhere can post pretty pictures and have people write nice things about it on the website. Trip Advisor gives you the input of people who have already experienced what you are considering. It helps to know what you are getting yourself into...
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Love TripAdvisor and love this app. The integration of their extensive reviews with mapping makes the app even more useful (and interesting) to me than the website. I've had a crash or two, so it's not yet perfect, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, nonetheless.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
Easy to use and we were able to find the best places both local and abroad!  Looking forward to using it for our next trip planning.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
I love TripAdvisor and the app ROCKS!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Easier to use than the Internet! Great job!

This app is a must have for those who enjoy eating, traveling or seeing ;). Neat and easy to use interface on the iPad. Its so nice when developers get it RIGHT!
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Easy to use and simple interface.  Makes on site reviews easy.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
The best app at all times

Like the app because I love the website, but I wanted to be able to add things I found on my mobile to my account record of "my trips" :(
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
Easy to use.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
I'm glad to have it on IPhone, gives me quick & helpful access to all what I need on the go. Thanks.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
Such a great app.  Perfect for travelers needing to find a spot on the go.  Easy to navigate the maps and click on points of interest, accommodation, etc.  Would most certainly recommend for anyone traveling without a concrete plan.  Invaluable when it comes to booking and investigating on the go.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 2
If you want something with GPS interaction, this app is good. If you're using your iPad while sitting on the couch, hop online instead.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
On any continent, Trip Advisor is the only guide you'll need!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
As a travel professional, I trust Trust Trip Advisor for honest reviews on hotels and restaurants.
From Budapest to Dallas and all points in between!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
This is awesome
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
This app is setup great and easy to navigate. All travelers must have this on their iPhone

How could it be any easier than to literally travel the world by review, right from the ease and comfort of your own phone! Puh-lease!! Bon Voyager!

This app is the shizzle
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
I love the app. Better than most, but the filtering elements on the web are much better. Too much scrolling, not many options to save time.  Overall, very useful, but...
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
This is great to check out the latest reviews of hotels for my upcoming honeymoon.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Very handy. Very easy to use. Just like their website.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Good app
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
I love having Trip Advisor in a handy app! I wish the filtering was as good as it is on the website, but it is still really useful when I'm planning trips or traveling to new cities.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
I tend to be hesitant when getting an app, but this is fun and easy!  I have found out a lot about the town I live in; restaurants, places to go and things to do. My main reason for getting it was to help me plan a vacation in Belgium and it has been extremely helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Lovely, but would like to be able to save searches.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
This little app helps me scope the cheapest days so I cN plan accordingly. I likes it.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Still not as good the website. Need to add more functionality.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Great app for on the fly traveller reviews and research when a PC not available

Easy to navigate, very fast and well organized!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
I like all aspects of the app but they need to improve the forum on iPad. When you return to a thread it sends you back to the first page of the thread. Otherwise very helpful and nice.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
This is a really useful app. Wayyy better than all the travel books I could have bought.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Extremely useful but sometimes crashes. Works after you open it up again though so no big deal.  I use it just about every time I leave the house.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Get it! The App is very helpful and easy to use.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Excellent app that replicates most of what you will find on tripadvisor.com.  A must for those who want real answers about hotels and an essential tool for do-it-yourself vacation planners.  5 stars.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Great app for travelers!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
TripAdvisor is really the most complete travel app on the AppStore today. We have been able to book rooms while driving into a city, research restaurants in small towns in Vermont, and find the best deals on flights to Hawaii.

If you only want on app for travel, this is the one I would recommend.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Great app, very easy to use and provides you with all the relevant information in a user friendly format.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5

It's one of my favorites!  I always use it before eating out and staying at hotels.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Easy to use. Quicker than going to the webpage.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Love love love this app!  Use it alot and post reviews.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 2
Helpful with hotels. Not helpful with restaurants. I am at least 40 minutes from NYC including a bridge - and that is with no traffic!  However, I  get NYC choices. 

The eateries in my area are not updated; there are good places to that are nowhere on the list. Our town is the county seat and does not exist according to Trip-advisor. I can't enter it and my zip code brings up the inconsistent information.

Quite importantly, there is no separate listing to search for kosher restaurants! Kosher is not an international cuisine, it is a way of life, and many people would make use of a separate listing. Often vegetarians search for kosher dairy restaurants. There are a large contingency of kosher travelers and folks who keep kosher who want to find places they can eat. RETHINK, please.

My husband travels most of the year. I thought this would be a great app for him and for myself at home and on the road - I was disappointed.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Very helpful app so far.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Has everything you need before you go on a trip! 
The problem is, however, when ur being nice and writing a review, the programmers didn't take enough time to make sure the application somehow SAVES your written review after telling you your nickname is taken so u can just easily try another nickname and not have to rewrite the whole thing over!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 3
I love the resources that tripadvisor has. 

The ipad version is limited compared to the web version?

Wish it had the ability to access trip folder and save individual forum posts to trip folders like on the web site. I use that feature a lot when researching trips.  The inability to do that on the iPad version lessens it's blue to me..
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
It's a great app--very helpful for planning a trip. One thing I wish you could do is a search for hotels by desired dates filtered by price.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Easy to navigate
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
A terrific app. Most reliable and easy to use

If you are planning a vacation, this is a must have tool.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Love the trip advisor app, easy to navigate. But no feature to save the properties I'm researching to my trip folders. So when I do find a hotel or restaurant I want to remember for later I have to fire up the webpage. But the app is still where I prefer to surf.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
It's the truth!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Awesome app! Easy to use and fully functional. You can write your reviews and access your trip advisor account. I love it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Restaurants section is rough but so is every other app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
A must for all travelers
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Thank you for allowing me to vent about a disheartening and unpleasant hotel stay.  Your site was easy to use and even though I have never written a review before I do travel a lot and will definitely check your site before I make the mistake of booking a hotel on Pricelines ratings again!  Keep up the good work so that people will know what to REALLY expect from the services they are buying in good faith!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Use extensively, ratings accurate, descriptions helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Extremely helpful. Easy to use.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 4
Some apps are even better than their corresponding website, and Tripadvisor is one of them. While they could use a few more filters, and I'd prefer if the app would remember where you last searched, this is still a very worthwhile download for frequent travelers.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
Great app.  I'm using it more than I ever thought I would.  Easy to use....couldn't travel without it.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 4
This app is great! I can put in any location and get info for just about anything I need or want to find!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 4
I love this app. Very helpful.....I would recommend to anyone.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
In the past I relied solely on google maps for planning vacations, but finding this app made it so much easier. You just type a location, and immediately you know what to do and where to stay. It greatly helps in filtering out what is really worth seeing and doing. I also find it beneficial that you get to see user photos of hotels - great help for me and hard to find elswhere. Easy to use, like a good ipad app should be. I also use the ipod version too, both are good.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
Trip Advisor is the must-have resource when traveling. It's extremely helpful.

Decent app, but does not find everything in the area.  Using other sources always a good thing.  Search needs to be smarter and search within area when requested - I often got results on different continent.

The most useful app for travelers
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 2
When I use this app, it will connect me to the city of interest. Then when I choose an attraction or location and go to the external link, that website loads fine. However, most times when I try to go back and select another link, it will time out and say I have no Internet connection. I then go to my other apps, and they can no longer connect either. I have to manually kill my wifi connection, restart it, and then my other apps work fine again. I have tested this 4 different times, and it occurs every single time. I have never had any wifi connectivity problems with my iPad until I booted up this app tonight. Sadly, it is completely unusable for me. 

However, it works like an absolute champ on my iPhone over wifi. But I would really prefer to use it on my iPad. So I'm giving it zero stars on my iPad, 4 stars on my iPhone, for a net of 2 stars.
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 5
This is one of the best apps on my phone! Very useful...I use it all the time for all of my travels.

I live browsing all the reviews for any hotel I'm considering staying at.  I've also used it to find other hotels in an area I'd never heard of and it worked great.  App itself is very stable.

It is great to have trip advisor on the go. We used it a lot while traveling in Europe and the advice never let us down.

This app is very useful but is missing some things like the possibility to se vacation rental homes witch are what I prefer using when I go on vacation. Please add this feature !
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 4
Love the trip advisor app. Just like the website, it is easy to use and navigate. The forum, however, could be better. If you are sifting through a forum with more than 20 topics, you have to hit the "add 20" at the bottom to see the next 20 topics When you hit the back button after opening a topic, the app takes you back to the beginning so you have to "add 20" until you get back to where you were. This can get annoying, especially when the forum has hundreds if not thousands of topics.
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5

Valuable reviews, especially on hotels.
Version 5.4 2011-03-10 5
When traveling I most appreciate hearing the good, the bad, and sometimes the ugly, from other travelers.   I use Tripadvisor either first to seek suggestions or secondly to check on a suggestion someone else has given me.  I find the reviews fair, honest, and informative.  I have been pleased with every suggestion I chose to take. Many Thanks for keeping me informed, safe, and a happy traveler!

Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
We use it extensively when traveling for hotels, restaurants, even golf course reviews.  Fast, reliable, great maps.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Great!
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 2
I love the site, but the app doesn't work well. First problem: click on get rates. It won't really get you rates. It asks if you want to check other sites for rates which is weird. Second problem: scrolling through the pics. There's something wring with this feature. You can scroll side to side easily, but not up and down without a fight. Strange.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Wonderful app. Very similar to the online product. Lots of reviews, pics, etc. Loads fast, no crashes.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Been using it all the time since got it.  Greatness

Version 5.4 2011-03-12 4
This app rocks as my GPS is outdated.
It really lowers the frustration level when traveling.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Had to do a quick check on hotel reviews last night, downloaded the app and searched for reviews. Within 2 mins I made a decision on where NOT to stay.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
I've had a wonderful time finding restaurants in my hometown. It is a nice blend of TripAdvisor online and the GPS capabilities of the iPad.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 4
It is really usefull
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5

Simple and easy; a must have if you want to enjoy the places you visit!
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
This app is by far the most user friendly traveler app I have tried. It is so easy to search, and also easy to add reviews which is something that most apps don't allow through your phone.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Business traveler in Stockholm and Helsinki. I use it daily for recommendations. Good results for restaurants and places to see on free time. Highly recommend!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Best app I've used so far for trip help
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Useful tool.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 3
Interesting and nice app, but depends much on user's uploads. So we have to start sending our reviews.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 4
Very good integration with maps.  User photos and reviews helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5

The buttons are too touchy and the map takes forever to update.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Was very useful!!!

I love this app and will only use my iPad to go on Trip Advisor from now on because I love it so much. Easy to use. Helpful map features. Two thumbs way up!
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 4
So easy to use and great to use
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
I have to say this app is my tour leader during my business trips, i can use it and find out where to stay, where to eat and also i have a chance to know what activities are available.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Simple and efficient
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
I love the app and rating thing. It's fun. Like to think about the service I get at places.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Trip Advisor for iPad makes it easy to plan your trip ahead of time and as you go.  I also use it to find restaurant ratings and activities near my home. Easily one of my favorite "indespensible" apps.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Works!
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Great!
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Used to choose hotels in Germany and the pictures were very helpful in making our selection.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
We saved lots of money reading people's opinions then deciding what we really wanted to spend our money on.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
I use this app all the time; local & while traveling. It is nice to be able to read reviews from people just like me rather than ownership. I like that you can search by price, ratings, location, etc.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Great app that is simple to use and serves it's purpose very well. I'm in the hospitality industry so it's great to be able to pop through reviews of my property.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
I love trip advisor on the computer and this is easier than that! Just type in a city and find anything you need to know a about it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Simple to use.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 3
Too slow for updating reviews and photos.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Great!
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 4
This is great app. Very useful. Great for finding a place to stay or something to do when you don't know anything about the area you are visiting. 

Would give 5 stars if each of the entries for "things to do" had a better description or at least a link to the website of the point of interest.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 4
New to the app but I am sure it will be good. Used the site to book my next vacation.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5
Don't know what I'd do without it now that I have it. So quick and convenient to find stuff and read about places before you go.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 4
Good info
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 4
Solid app. Beautiful on iPad. Great when traveling and looking for a restaurant and things to do
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-13 4
Not loving the fact that you can't weed out competitive reviews from rival vendors ... Need to work on that.
Version 5.4 2011-03-13 4
This app is helpful but doesn't have all the functionality of the website.  I would like to look at vacation rental homes and I can't see that in the app.  I love trip advisor and always utilize it to get the best restaurants, hotels and attractions in a new town.  This app is the next best thing.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
If your not around your computer then this is your 2nd best option. All the best from the website in an easy to use app!
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
I use trip advisor all the time! Great app. I highly recommend trip advisor and encourage everyone to log on and rate the restaurants and hotels they frequent. Also tips on what to do when you reach your destination.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
Best app to have when planning a vacation.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
I am very glad that I have this app. It is easy to use Anne useful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
Couldn't function without Trip Advisor. Whenever we're traveling, I check out hotels, restaurants, attractions. I've found some real gems others had no idea existed! Always try to return the favor by posting my reviews as well so others will know about the places and things I've found.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
Easy to use.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
I have found some if the best Restuarants and hotels from Mexico to all over the US.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 4
I have enjoyed all the features. This is a great for new travel location as well as old weekend getaways.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
Since I discovered Trip Advisor I use it every time I travel whether it's vacation or business Trip Advisor has never steered me wrong.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
Tripadvisor has been my go to site for my travel research for years. I've used the iPhone version in the past but this iPad version with the additional real estate is such a refreshing experience. I think the layout is great but I wish there was a way to make reviews full screen instead of just on the left pane. Maybe there is a way to do this that I haven't figured out? Anyway its only a small gripe, I am still giving it 5 stars!
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
As an avid fan of Tripadvisor, I am thrilled to have it at my fingertips on my phone!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
Very cool app must to have in your IPhone 4
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 4
It's a good app, but it needs to access menus and/or restaurant website.  Also needs to go to directions on the map
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
Great app. Especially for planning and while on the road.
Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
it lists everything twice. If you fix that I'll give you 5 stars.

Version 5.4 2011-03-15 4
Fix multitasking-- it's annoying to wait for it to reload though the splash screen every time I switch in or out of the app. Otherwise very good.
Version 5.4 2011-03-15 5
It's perfect to find review of hotels
Version 5.4 2011-03-15 5
I found this site quite helpful and subsequently felt the need to write reviews myself so others may benefit in the way I did
Version 5.4 2011-03-15 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-16 4
I work in hotel and recomend this app for travel
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 4
Downloaded this app while planning a trip to Rome. Was very helpful while planning, even more helpful while in Rome. I did find more than my share of listed restaurants where no longer in business. But with restaurants coming and going so quickly, who could keep an up to date list.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 4
Loads of info. Sometimes too much. Good interface!
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
App is sick
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
It has been very helpful in finding the best deals. I will continue to use for future trips
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
I love this convenient app for my iPad. Since I take it with me everywhere I go, Trip Advisor is the perfect travel companion.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
There are lots of places to get advice, but Tripadvisor makes it easy to find everything I want in one place.  You need to read a little, but learn a lot.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 4
I am always changing my mind about my next destination.  And then I am sometimes at a loss for a suggestion of where next to go! Even so, Trip Advisor comes to the rescue.  Know the town starts with a "G" but can't recall exactly? Start typing and this app will suggest for you. want to know what to see and do there? It is only a fingertip away. Worried that the bed and breakfast is too far from the local attractions? Ask to see where it is on the map...again with just a finger touch you have the information. Trip Advisor is speedy, smart, quick. Love it.  Use it daily ...even for my home area recommendations!
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
Helpful. Love the Photo Add Feature...
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
Kinda new to TripAdvisor but am quickly falling in love with this app!  I'm in Cabo San Lucas right now and have used this app to find some awesome places to eat!
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 3
It works well for searching for things on the fly, but full version works much better for writing reviews and digging deeper.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
Initially I wasn't impressed. That all changed when I started shopping for flights and hotels! Now I don't bother with any other site or app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
Lohve this app, 'have had many successful hotel bookings solely from  from the pool  of people contributing to this site. Large demographic of people ( young or old, couples or singles. helps you weigh in the negatives and positives and make better booking decisioonsd. Definitely a useful tool!
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
I'm so in love with this app
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 4
I don't know how often they update their info. They have a LOT of restaurants that are actually closed.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
The near me now feature with the 
Map and the directions capability is very helpful and very informative. It makes having a smart phone worth the expense.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
Great to have for any trip!! I love this app!
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 3
Overall I like the app very service is well appreciated.

Version 5.4 2011-03-18 4
Great App!
Version 5.4 2011-03-18 4
The app is very nice in all ways but one. I use tripadvisor for all trips and generally do most of the planning for a trip using the site. For this I use a computer and would very rarely use an iPhone app. Where I believe this app is meant to shine is when you are on the vacation. Currently I'm in Chiang Mai and using the app to help find restaurants and things to do. And while I'm sitting in a cafe using the wifi- great!  Love it finding my location and sorting results by distance from me. But imagine my dismay when I leave the cafe with app in hand- headed toward a restaurant, viewing the map, and then the app informs me it only works with a data connection and closes. Now I no longer have the address or information about the restaurant. I wander aimlessly. 
I hope you get the point. At the worst the app should just inform that data connection is gone and let the gps work with the already downloaded map and address of most recent location. For real kudos though- anticipate that this app will get used in lots of places that finding a wifi cafe won't be easy. Allow some pre-loading of content. It couldn't be that hard. 
I believe all apps should actually be disallowed from closing due to no Internet. I understand functionality will decrease, but that doesn't mean it has to close. I think apple should make this a rule. 
Anyway, glad there is an app and it is quite useful when you have data. Work on the (many) times users will not.

Absolutely live tripadvisor and this app adds great mobile access to their excellent service.  I've used tripadvisor for every trip I've ever taken on my own as an adult!! I would really be lost without it
Version 5.4 2011-03-18 5
Nice one
Version 5.4 2011-03-18 2
The app just makes a different frame for the mobile web site. No need to take up space on your phone when you could just use their web site. All functions work fine though.
Version 5.4 2011-03-18 5
So far, no problems & I really like the application.

Version 5.4 2011-03-19 4
Used it for excursions on an Eastern Caribbean cruise. The suggestions from locals and people who have been there are invaluable. 
I even use this app in my own hometown to see what others know that I don't. Very helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-19 3
I might be missing something

Love trip advisor! I dont stay anywhere without reading about it. Handy app. Get to rate immediately from my phone.
Version 5.4 2011-03-19 4
First of all I love, love TripAdvisor and all its contributors. This app is well done and is perfect the way it is if you are a spontaneous explorer. The combination of knowing your location and highlighting the things to do around you is very convenient and enlightening. 

With that written I really want to give this app 3.5 stars because of the following improvements I desire: 1) you start over at the home screen every time you open the app, 2) doesn't sign you in to your TA account, 3) doesn't let you accumulate a list of things to do for your next trip (e.g., a couple of weeks ago I read about a great restaurant in the city we are visiting, but now I found myself asking, "What was that restaurant I read about?"). 

If you can give this app a memory then it will be a five star hit.
Version 5.4 2011-03-19 4
Gets better, and better over time, good job, keep going!
Version 5.4 2011-03-19 4

Version 5.4 2011-03-19 4
If you are traveling to a new and unique place. This app is a must have. The best way to have a great time is to understand what people have and have not enjoyed before you. This app allows you to have that word of mouth that allows you to have that great experience.

Great app!! Very useful when traveling to a new place
Version 5.4 2011-03-20 4
Wonderful app but wish it was easier to save reviews you like to your personal location folders. For now, you have to copy reviews/materials and get out of the app to paste content in your email etc. Then when you head back into the app you start all over again from scratch. :( 
Otherwise, very informative app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-20 5

I've used Trip Advisor for years to plan my trips; it's so handy to have the app at hand for a change in plans or a spontaneous day trip! Trip Advisor has never let me down. I've gotten some of the best restaurant suggestions from this site/ now app. It's also a great source for activities.

I did not know how much I was missing out on until I started reading reviews! I have been traveling all over Europe for the past 3 years and thanks to the reviews on this app I have avoided places that were not worth my time and seen and done some amazing adventures thanks to the people who contribute to thus app!!!! I am slowly becoming a reviewer and hope that I can help everyone enjoy or avoid (if the place is bad) the places and things that I have, based on my positive or negative reviews. :)))))

Version 5.4 2011-03-23 5
I use Tripadvisor every time we travel and find that its combination of recommendations of places to go, stay and eat have been very helpful for choosing just the right vacations and days out. The suggestions for restaurants, hotels and places to visit located on the map according to my present location or destination make planning even easier. The reviews and photos are a click away and street views too! Great job! I know I will be using this app a lot!
Version 5.4 2011-03-23 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
Clean and simple interface
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
This has saved money by trying hotels I would never have tried without the reviews I found here.

Amazing! Accurate and saved me tons of time. Download this one!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
Fully featured with the same depth and breadth of the information on the website. Easy to navigate. It's trip advisor condensed to an app, but just as valuable as the site. If you're a frequent traveler, get this app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 4
Great app
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
I haven't gotten to take full advantage of it yet.  But in 2 weeks I have a big trip planned for south carolina.  That will be the big test!
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
Used it on my PC all the time fir travel, hotels, restaurants, & things to do, but could never get it on my  Blackberry. I now have a Verizon iPhone & enjoy ao much on my cell. It's just terrific!
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
Great for finding good restaurants, nearby things to do, hotel advice, etc. based on actual user experiences.
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
I am very happy with this app
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 4
This app is so easy to use. I just simply love it.
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 3
If you want to improve your chances of finding a good place to eat, stay, or visit, then this app is for you.
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
I wouldn't leave home without it.  Helps near home too in finding restaurants.
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
Used trip advisor all over Europe & south Africa on our honeymoon, found wonderful hotels and places to eat
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
Halfway to Florida from the Midwest. Popped up this ridiculously awesome app and got to see my IPhone map application integrate with a bunch of hotels and restaurants for our middle of our trip accommodations. So painless. Well done, lads.
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
Muy facil de usar
Version 5.4 2011-03-24 5
I love my "Trip Advisor" app. It has all the information, complete with links to help you make informative decisions about your vacations, business trips, etc.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
The Tripadvisor app is very useful...I search near home and when planning to travel somewhere. The rating system for almost any category is a great tool. Whether your searche is either an adventure or simply a hotel it will rank them by geographical location based on customer reviews. Reviews are very useful thanks to the large Tripadvisor user community.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
VERY handy!
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
Great
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
I use this app more than any other.  It's a little more cumbersome than the website, but extremely handy.  I mostly use it to check hotel ratings and reviews, and I definitely book based on what I read.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 4
Its a good tool.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
We traveled around the world for a year and relied mostly on Trip Advisor.  This app is a great IPad version.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 4
Very good!!!! Muy bueno!!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 3
A few bugs, but not bad.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
I used this app recently on a trip to Europe. Using the wifi connection in my hotel room, I was able to figure out where nearby restaurants were, load up the map on my device and get to the restaurant easily. The app also finds information very fast so the user experience is great.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 2
Keep working on it. Until you further develop, I will use the webpage.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
Great app! Thank you trip advisor!
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
I travel a ton for work and use this app all the time to check out reviews.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
I have used Trip Advisor numerous times for hotels here and in Europe, and have found it to be extremely helpful and accurate.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
Just got my iPad, and this is a must app.  If you are a user of this app, report any closed establishments, it will help the rest of us in our travels.  I would not hesitate to recommend this app to others, very good.
Version 5.4 2011-03-25 5
This app is a great way to find good places to eat when traveling. I never leave home without it.

One of my favorite travel apps. Traveler photos are especially helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 4
Does everything you would want in a travel app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5
I have consulted Trip Advisor since 2003 for every trip and the Posted comments have been instrumental in many of our decisions. The reviews are thoughtful, comprehends and candid. We have not experienced any that were mean spirited or totally off base. 
While we haven't posted our fair share ( working two jobs, kids young, etc) we will try to do more now we are empty nesters!
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 2
So tired of opening this app and it shows me my home. I want to research trips I'm going to take. It would be fine if I were where I am going but who waits until they are thousands of miles from home to find a hotel.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5
So easy to use... Look at all the places I want to go!
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5

This app is definitely what everybody would need if they feel lost and confused about a place they wanna travel to!
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 3
App is ok but needs more of the filters that are available in the full site such as non-stop flights and planing tools.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 4
Easy to use on iPad front end for goggle maps.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 4

I can honestly say that this is my favorite app. It's been amazing in helping me when I travel!! Love it!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5
This is the best app for planning a trip. It's a one-stop app, in that you see a map of where you're going, plus pictures, hotel locations by pin drop, restaurants, flights, etc.  All organized very nicely, and very easy to understand and navigate  Start here for any trip!
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5
Perfect!
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5
Everything right at my fingertips. Best travel app ever!

Before we travel, we always research on Trip Advisor, and they've never steered us wrong.  I would hate to take a trip without it.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 4
Very informative

This app is just like the website and very easy to navigate. Thanks TripAdvisor for finally making this available.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 4
Like it's simplicity. Don't like the fact that you can't see the days of the week when selecting dates.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5
Extremely handy.  Only travel app I need.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 4
Lists the main attractions but doesn't give you a full feel for the hidden gems. Good general information
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
The best!
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 3
I have nothing but praise for Tripadvisor.com. The breadth and depth of information is staggering. Like so many before me, I have depended on Tripadvisor.com to plan a variety of travel experiences. The app is a pale but attractive approximation of its mother. It offers a superficial first round of info, which for a casual traveler may be sufficient. But it simply doesnt go the distance for building a true itinerary.  The app ends up frustrating me, and then I go the website. To quote Marvin and Tammy: "Ain't nothin' like the real thing baby."
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
Said it all in title
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 4

Easy to navigate with a intuitive interface, the iPad version is friendlier to use than the web site
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 2
Trashy. Got panhandled in the lobby and security told me that was part of the "experience". I realize a lot of people that stay here are trashy but when I spend >$100/night I expect a clean safe room w/o being harassed by bums.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
Very useful and clean UI !
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 4
It's overall a nice app. It would be nice to have the ability to save searches or create bookmarks to return to a particular location.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 4
I use this app every time I travel. Love the specifics of the reviews.

Version 5.4 2011-03-27 4

Love the reviews on the fly and the flight search function.  Better than the Kayak & Yelp Apps.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
This app saved me time and frustrations
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 4
The app itself is excellent and is as good or better than the web site.   However, the recommendations in Trip Advisor while great are not necessarily comprehensive and I find tend to be more tourist focused.  For example Zagat will provide better more accurate and more comprehensive restaurant recommendations.  In the end user based reviews/rankings are great but have limitations.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
Very helpful app (and website). Worth the download. Easy to use and understand
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5

I love trip advisor. So excited that it's an app now. But I was writing a review and there's no save button! The app froze telling me I had no Internet connection when I was on wifi. When the app finally reopened my long a** review was gone. Yelp saves your work trip advisor doesn't.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 4
But relocate Southern Sun Ikoyi Hotel to Alfred Rewane road where it's physically from Osborne road in your map which is not the correct location.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
Used this app while traveling from New England to SC...fantastic to find nearby restaurants with GOOD food after a long day of driving.  Also useful to find banks, stores, gas while away.  Came in very handy!  A well-done app - thank you to its creators!

Handy and very useful and free.
Version 5.4 2011-03-28 4
Tripadvisor is the best travel app out there. I've picked so many hotels and restaurants based on so many countries that I have been to.  My only reservations is perhaps a reviewer is a fraud. For the most part i feel i can sift thought a dishonest review.  Tripadvisor is only as good as the reputation of the reviewer. I feel TA does a good job allowing honest reviews. Thanks TA ! Kevin

Love being able to find a place to sleep by location, the trip advisor reviews and ratings is right no most of the time. I'm a fan for sure.

Only one complaint, this app seems more powerful when I'm actually there, I find it easier to research using safari and the actual website,  maybe a more powerful research interface in the future?

It's the best way to find great places to stay and things to do in the places we visit. We have not been led astray yet!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-29 2
Rashes alot and gives you the wrong info on prices on the majority of hotels but the app is very neat and has a lot of potentials maybe expanding their searches to travelocity and orbits might help.
Version 5.4 2011-03-29 4
Very easy to use. I like the helpful information on locating hotels along our travel route.
Version 5.4 2011-03-29 1
Tripadvisor is indispensable. However their mobile website has everything the app has including the two app function buttons, home and locations nearby. Also with safari, you can bookmark to save and you can quickly scroll to the top of page after reading reviews; two useful things which you can't currently do in app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-29 4
Wouldn't want to travel without it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-29 4
I use it for reference to see how others rate hotels before I book mine.

Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
For planning a trip and also travelling, this app rocks!  Anywhere i was, i could just press 'near me now' and had a list and map of all the cool places nearby.  Love the traveller reviews and tips - like having a friend 'on the inside' wherever you go!
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 4
Would love to be able to bookmark stuff so that I can remember what I was interested in for later. Being able to check off what you have already done would also be great.
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
Very cool app! It's nice to hear other people's opinions before going somewhere. Highly recommend.
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 3
This app is fine but really sorely lacks the ability to bookmark items found. This really is a handicap when trying to build an itinerary.
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
Great app very informative
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 4
Tripadvisor is on top of my list of best travel sites!. This app is great to have on the go. I would love for it to be able to save favorites for easy and fast access. Enjoy!!

Using this app to map out our trip to Rome. The UI is smooth, easy to navigate, and makes planning any trip a lot more fun.
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
This is the first app that actually is very user friendly from minute one... It also is in affiliation with popular travel sites like Expedia. Great app, and most importantly it's free....
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 2
My husband and I returned on March 28 th from a 5 night stay with another couple. After reading the previous reviews, I am really confused. If 5 stars is the best a hotel can achieve, I don't see how this hotel comes close. Even some of the reviewers who gave it an excellent rating listed many things amiss. Let 's not confuse the island,the people,the activities with the hotel. I would give the hotel 2.5 stars. Where to begin... Before you leave the lobby,look around,it's not very clean and it looks tired. Have a drink a the bar outside Palio and look at the shelves above it, they haven't been cleaned in a VERY long time. Ditto the windows in Marbella,which look out to the courtyard. The rooms were the same. We booked an ocean front room and it took 3 tries to get a room with a view that was not obstructed by palm trees. The lounge chairs at the pool were not in the best of shape either. Having to pay for WiFi is absurd. Making guests chose to pay or sit in the lobby to log on is insulting. The workout room is archaic. I know we are in the islands and should be outside, but to call that a gym is a joke. I stayed at the Rio Mar when it was a Westin,7 years ago, and nothing has been updated. I have stayed in many hotels in the islands and they have great work out spaces. Ok, the restaurants... clearly not enough choices on the property and expensive,not a big deal. I expect pricey food at a resort. Oh, the casino, so tiny and no craps. Many people, come to Puerto Rico because there is gambling. This casino is turn off. The first night we were there the board above the roulette table was working, the next night, it was broken,really?
 Most of the staff were extremely nice,warm and friendly. Thankfully, they steered us to great restaurants and activities in the vicinity. We had really good local food at Hacienda, Pasta y Pueblo and a few of the Kiosks. The kayak trip to the Bio Bay was worth doing.
My husband and I love Puerto Rico,just not this hotel. So while I would give our vacation a 5 Star rating, there is no way the hotel deserves anything close.

Version 5.4 2011-04-01 4

Better than on a computer

Nice app that condenses the website into an easy to use iPhone app.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
I would never take a trip without it. Now I may never visit a restaurant without it.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 2
This is a very useful app, but if there is a momentary hiccup in your Internet connection it complains, quits abruptly, and loses your place when you restart it.   This makes it extremely frustrating if you are trying to use a weak wifi signal, such as when traveling, which is the whole point of the app.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 4
Very helpful. I will use this app for all my tale needs. :)
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
If you travel, this is a great source for real user reviews.

Easy to navigate. Has all info from website and up to sate!

Fantastic app and fantastic site! Helps to find entertainments even in the small boring towns! I don't speak about hotels reviews and ratings - it's just brilliant!
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
Amazing application!  This application provides places to to see and eat at along with recommendations from visitors just like me who sometimes show up at off hours at the restaurants.   

I just found the application this weekend, so I'll be putting it through it's paces to see if the family thinks I'm amazing for picking out a great place to eat and a few nice sites to visit down in Gatlinburg, TN.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5

I live in NYC. It is great to explore the city.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 1
I realize Russia probably isn't part of trip advisor's market focus, but if you're going to offer a product the least you could do is refrain from spreading misinformation. this app is absolutely useless here, offering all sorts of incorrect price and location data.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
I always consult TA before booking anything
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
Used it on a road trip to Myrtle Beach and knew we only wanted to drive approximately 1/2 way.  We weren't sure when we were going to get tired and used this App to be able to see what hotels were 30 minutes to an hour down the road.  It was a great way to gauge how much farther we wanted to drive before there we were in a place with no hotel choices.  Will recommend to anyone taking road trips!!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5

In Amsterdam and loving this app.
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 2
The Trip Advisor iphone application has an option to filter hotel search results by price, but there is no filter to find results for pet friendly hotels. Until this is improved, this is not a very useful application for many travelers with pets that need to be able to locate the pet friendly options at a glance. Instead they must painstakingly click on and read the information for each individual hotel. Once you install the app on your iPhone, this becomes even more problematic because if you try to go to the regular website version via the Internet, you are automatically defaulted to the application. Please, add the hotel pet friendly filter to this application!!! If this change is made, this would be a Five Star App!
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
Just tried this for my I pad.  I love this app.

It dose everything that it says it'll do I love it.
Version 5.4 2011-04-05 4
This app has a lot of information, and has been so helpful when planning vacations or even just day trips! The only reason it got four stars, rather than five is that some places I found in my local area were closed, when the app still listed them as open.

Sweet App....anything you need to see or know about a hotel is there!! Love it
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 4

I'am a travel agent and I love coming to this site to read reviews and give my clients suggestions or recommendations of activities they may want to try.  Often, i refer my clients to this site if they are choosing a vacation or they are trying to decide between two or more vacations. I also use trip advisor personally for planning our get-aways. I have come to find it to be very reliable.
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
Always a great resource and I use it every tine I travel!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 3

Version 5.4 2011-04-07 4
We stopped here on a long drive with a 2 & 1 year old. Very nice place with on site restaurant that was good enough, free wifi, pool, and small fitness center. Staff was courteous (but a bit understaffed. It was 5 pm and everyone was trying to check in.)  A lovely stay

I'm stuck in a coffee shop because it's pouring outside and i don't have an umbrella... But I'm sorta stressed because I need to book a trip. TGFTA (thank G-d for this app!) - it let me do everything I needed to do right from the comfort of my warm, dry booth!  The only thing it doesn't do is guarantee sunshine on your vacation...but maybe the next version will do that!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Very easy interface and many good reviews, pics. Etc. I'll bring this everywhere
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Traveling often my time is spent orienting and asking questions about the local fair. Not any more! This app has saved me so much time, now I can enjoy discovering not searching.

I'm very glad I found this app. Saves time and my marriage. I mostly appreciate the maps that show where I am and where I need to go. That's great when the husband is driving, if you know what I mean. This is the first thing I will pack when going out of town from now on.

Version 5.4 2011-04-07 4
Haven't got to use it out of town but I have played with it before we leave and love it! It's going to be great using the nearest food and "what to do" option. We are a family that argues on where to go because we don't know what's around and always end up mad because something was just down the road we love!
Version 5.4 2011-04-08 5
Just wish that one click would take me back to initial search page.

Version 5.4 2011-04-09 5

Version 5.4 2011-04-09 5
You need to navigate into this app. The more you become familiar with it the more you realize how very much it has to offer. I was truly afraid to go to Europe because it was such an unknown, but reading the reviews from people just like myself has given me the courage to travel 6,200 miles, google earth calculation, not quite boldly, but confidently.

I find that Trip Advisor is really accurate. Some reviews really give the way it is for travelers. Only wish that you could do targeted searches, within the reviews so info was filtered.

Great app to explore all that trip advisor has to offer. I use it often to find something to do when I'm on the go and since my recent move. 

My only suggestion would be to add 'sharing' capabilities (email, Facebook, twitter) and a bookmark feature. Great on the iPad and iPhone both!
Version 5.4 2011-04-10 5
Very handy app !!

If you use the TripAdvisor app just for research, then it's great. But if you want to write a review, it asks you to log in every time, and now it asks for all kinds of Facebook permissions--no thanks! PITA to try to write a review when you are on the run.
Version 5.4 2011-04-12 5

Could use a wider airline search field. Other than that a great app.

I have used tripadvisor for many years, I only book my stays from reviews here, the iPhone and o boy my new iPad 2 apps are freaking great, I'm already addicted to TA and this just made thing worse lol, also the iPad app in the best with looking at the pictures, way better than a desktop and iPhone. 5 stars all the way

I'm planning a vacation right now and this app has been REALLY helpful. Super easy to use and so far there have been a number of results for every search I've entered.  My only complaint is that I could not find a way to sort the reviews by rating. I do like to check the worst reviews as well as the best, and unfortunately it looks like the only way to view reviews is by date (most recent first).

I am a big fan of Expedia.com, however this Expedia application completely useless and I am not going to continue using it unless some helpful changes are implemented. First of all, hotel search is extremely limited and not much helpful. If you do search for hotels in let's say "Naples, Italy" it gives you hundreds of results of hotels all over Amalfi coast that are not even in vicinity of your particular search and destination interest. There is no way to select a specific area so you are forced to browse thru bunch of results that are not even related to your search. More over, you have only 2 options to sort results either by Popularity or Price. So if you are looking to search for only 4 stars hotels and above, you are out of luck. 
Also, there is no way to limit your search by specific amenity. Like I wanted only hotels with swimming pool, well there was no way to search it that way. They expect you to go thru each individual listing and look for this on your own. Which is fine, but then why would I even bother to waste time with Expedia app if it doesn't really help me to accomplish anything. They want you to quickly book hotel thru the app but fail to understand that people don't just book first hotel they see without actually being able to do a research and ensure it meets the expectations. At this point, TripAdvisor app is much more useful in doing all of the above.

The results show stores that are no longer there, wrong addresses, and even when the address is right, it shows up wrong on the map.  I must cut the address from tiro and paste it into some other mapper like maps.google to get the correct map location.

The recommendations are good, but the location part needs work.

Good app like their site. Reviews for the people by the people. I'll believe a travelers set of photos of hotels and destinations any day over the eye candy brochureware the hotels themselves provide. Love Tripadvisor.com and it's mobile extensions.

TripAdvisor.com has become my go-to site when making travel plans. This well-designed app puts the best features within easy reach. I'll still use the full site most often, but when I want to quickly check out a hotel or destination, it's easily available.

Using this app on an iPad. Some ideas to make this app better: 
1. When launching, I want the app to remember and land on the last search or thing I was viewing rather than default to my current location. Or it should at least ask me if I want to default to current location or last search. I know I can turn location services off, but still...I should have a choice when launching the app.
2. Ability within app to launch email and email a location or trip list to a friend.  Or some way of sharing your "my saves" with a friend....
3. Within "my saves" I want the ability to organize my favorite destinations in folders and subfolders similar to how I might organize bookmarks in a browser. 
4. Ability to create an itinerary / schedule for each day of my trip and export to my calendar app on my device. 
On the plus side, I did like the ability to link to Orbitz, Expedia or hotels.com to look at packages and then return back to the place I was viewing before.

I have used tripadvisor.com for years and love it.  Traveling with 2 adults, 2 kids, we trust and use the reviews to help us choose hotels, food and adventures in places we've never been.  Now, with this app, planning trips and reading and writing reviews is easier than on my computer.

Typed in a zip code of a semi-rural town, found 3 hotels that don't suit my needs. Knowing there are several hotels in nearby towns, I click the button that lets me search within 10 miles of my starting location, and.... Just kidding! There is no such button.

So I can either look in my selected zip code, or browse a list of towns in the entire state?? Alphabetically?? Come on, this is basic stuff.

I hate searching for places to go in the web, there are too many info to read,but with this app,every vacation planning is made easy. I highly recommend this app for avid travellers and for those who are not,because you will be converted...

Just loaded this app and so far it's great.  I'm not real crazy about sometimes having to choose different travel companies, ie. Priceline, Travelocity, Hotels.com, etc. to get my rates, if I wanted to use these, I would go to their sights.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.  Other than that it is very simple to use.
Version 5.7 2011-07-20 4
Very handy when looking for a place to stay in unfamiliar territory.  My only complaint is that I would like to have the direct number to the hotel rather than needing to go through hotels.com

I have only used this once but it made my work so easy. I was able to compare many hotels rapidly and determine availability. Then I had a choice of making reservations on one of many online services Orbitz, Priceline, Hotels.com , etc. 
  I will certainly use the app many times in the future. 
I did have a minor problem of returning to my home location and having to again retype my destination. 

I did have an issue when it came time to print my reservation. DO YOU HEAR THIS APPLE ? Printing... iPad...??  I own many printers .... but am not going to buy another printer just to print from the iPad. All this needs to be built into the iPad so it prints off the shelf ..... a computer device you can not easily print from ???? A device from APPLE which does not easily print ... foolishness !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a must have app for vacationers. The large community of users who provide ideas, ratings, and feeedback make this really special. My only advice, would be categories for things to do, outdoor, nightlife, tours, etc. I was trying to find a snorkeling beach in St.Pete. But ended up on the internet after a while. And maybe sorting by cost because we didn't want a snorkeling tour just a snorkeling beach we could head to. regardless, very close to 5 stars perfect.

Any time my husband I go on a trip or vacation, we always research hotels on tripadvisor.com. I do use it to check out the cities I visit as well.

Con Trip, puedo conocer y valorar lugares que no sabian que existian y que se encuentran muy cerca del lugar adonde me encuentro. Casi siempre las criticas son criteriosas aun que a veces no concuerdo con alguna de ellas. P ej. Comparan hoteles muy pequenios y mal ubicados con otros que se encuentran en la misma ciudad, mucho mejor equipados , y le Dan mas valor en su calificacion, confundiendo asi a Los usuarios pero eso solo se comprende al llegar al destino.

The app is super useful for getting reviews and pictures of lodging and activities. I use it all the time when planning trips, especially to warn me away from nasty or unpleasant surprises. 

It's been extremely helpful in planning trips to Europe, Seattle, NYC, and Maui, especially when trying to see the decor and room setup of various condos and hotels or trying to avoid places with bedbugs. It's also a great tool to check against the recommendations you find in guidebooks and on other travel sites, and is great if you combine the activity recommendations with sites like viator.com.

This is an amazing app for the traveling business man,couple on vacation or just some one visiting a town on a whim. It has many different options to search through. For instance looking for some where to eat? It will locate a restraint of your specifications wether it be something as simple as a fast food joint, a small homey diner or five star restaurant.but it doesn't stop there  looking for a motel, hotel or a very fancy Vila to stay at? Not a problem for this app it searches for a place for you to rest your head and relax in luxury and it will search in a price range for you

This is a fantastic app for on-the-go searches. I was using Yelp to find hotels, then going online to search for substantive reviews of each one but it was tedious and, honestly, I didn't want to pick based on single reviews or the completely untrustworthy ratings on hotels.com (that's a whole 'nother review). But the tripadvisor app gave me hotels in order of rank by reviews, and the reviews were legit! (Not just a bunch of 5-star reviews from 'a traveler'  with no comments to back it up. I'm looking at you, hotels.com.)

Plus, once we picked our hotel I could just click the next tab to find a great place to eat. Love this very useful, quick and practical app!

I look forward to using this app on an upcoming road trip!

Planning trip to Turks & Caicos. Started using tripadvisor.com but the site suggested I download the app. Already had app so fired that up to continue the search I was doing for scuba shops on Provo. Oddly the app only reports 1 thing to do. There are over 50 attractions at that location per the website, and another 30 or so tours. I hadn't set any filters (clearing didn't help). Anyway it's a mess and I'm back to using the site, which actually works great. Hopefully they'll address the issues but I don't recommend bothering.

Version 6.1 2012-04-09 2
Your app does not work well.  Maps are a disaster.  You can spend a lot of time just trying to get a decent view.  It starts at the satellite level for Berlin.  Dumb.  Who needs to see a map of all Europe when looking for hotels in Berlin.  It favors hotels that I don't want see and blocks my view of other hotels.  You have gone too commercial now and present hotels that pay you more.  This is not how Trip Advisor started and developed it's following.  You are opening the door for someone else to take over and not be biased. 

Unlike the website there is no place to put in your dates.  Thus you waste a lot of time and then find out it is not available.  I have tried other cities and the same problems.   It keeps crashing also and you have to start all over.  It is getting so it is easier to just use Hotels.com or Expedia.com or one of the others.  They are much quicker.  You end up there anyway.  The developer  of the App needs to do a lot of upgrading.  Very, very frustrating. Bob

I really tried to acclimate myself to the new app but I've finally gone back to just using tripadvisor.com instead. The new version is just too buggy, a lot of the search features provide incomplete results and the map is just awful. This was a really sweet app before they did this forced upgrade, one of my favorites as I'm an inveterate traveler and big tripadvisor fan. Bummer. If I could give it zero stars I would since I'm literally not using it anymore.

I am using TripAdvisor service a lot however this iPad app is a disappointment:
- user's Saves seem to be stored locally on iPad only, there is no way to see what I saved in iPad from iPhone app or website. It has been an unpleasant surprise for me as I planned my trip on iPad but when I went abroad on holiday, I could only have internet connection on my phone. So I had to purchase separate sim with data plan for ipad.
- the ui is often unresponsive (probably because the app is just a wrapper for tripadvisor.com website, not a fully native iOS app)
- filter settings are constantly reset. It is very annoying that I have to specify again that I want a b&b rather than a hotel with each new search
 
There are a lot of smaller glitches in this app too. I hope developers will take into account users feedback, looking forward for update

Used it a few times and it came in handy. The reviews, I learned, are subjective. I chose a 7.0 hotel near SeaTac Airport, and were it not for the fact that I would have lost my money I would have walked out. Now I cross reference with Hotels.com for a more informed view before I plunk down my money. But the app itself? Great!
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 2
Its what you would expect for an app of tripadvisor. The website is great but my biggest problem with the app is that I CAN'T change the language!!!!!
Version 6.2 2012-06-22 2
First off, I love TripAdvisor.com and have been a contributing member for years.  I've also patiently lived through various styles of apps for my phone, each with its own pro's and cons, but the current version was the first that forced me to comment here.  TripAdvisor both on the website and on the original apps worked well because of its integration into Google Maps.  Then some bright spark decided Bing would be so much better and without consultation, TripAdvisor's app started using this ridiculously poor mapping tool instead.  Ugh! This is an excellent example of how to fix what's NOT broken!  I'm really disappointed as this makes contributing to the platform a much worse and cumbersome process for me, which may see me simply stop altogether.  Bing users will certainly love it, especially Ms fanboys, but as for the rest of us who are familiar to Google's clear way of mapping hotels, places of interest and so on, pass this version by and save yourself some serious frustrations.  A huge thumbs down from me!

If you don't know your airport codes then looking up a flight is useless. I guess tripadvisor expects you to know every 3 digit airport code. I'll stick with the skyscanner app which blows this out of the water.

I just updated this app for my iPad 2, and it won't let me sign in. The page where you are suppose to enter your name and city are not formatted properly. It doesn't show any kind of submit button. Hitting 'return' doesn't do anything and we all know that the iPad doesn't have a tab button. So my sign in remains incomplete. I tried signing in tripadvisor.com using Safari and then returning to the app to see if that registered, but no. I guess I will just have to stop contributing and be a passive user. ARGHHHH!

So very disappointed! I needed a room at the last minute and was only given about 5 choices for the ENTIRE Phoenix-Scottsdale-Tempe area (population greater than 1 million). I agreed to go with Zona in Scottsdale UNTIL at the VERY last minute the app informed me of an extra $15.00 fee that was NOT listed in the original fees (on the feed page). Really? So instead of a $68 room it was going to be $83.00 which was not revealed until I went through the trouble of entering my card info. Smelling a scam with this app. Instead I went to Expedia app (location services) and found a great room at a great price.

I love that Tripadvisor links to other sites and resources I would normally access separately, like Open Table, hotels.com, travel booking sites, and it has a discussion forum where you can learn tips about the places you want to go from those who've been there. Love the honest reviews! Very useful. It's my go to site. I planned an unforgettable short trip to NYC with my husband all through Tripadvisor!

Version 6.4 2012-09-03 3
I am an avid Tripadvisor user, and can't rave enough about how much I love the site, but this app is just plain disappointing.  My biggest gripe is with the function of saving attractions, hotels, etc.  When browsing through the list for a city, every single time I "save" one of the attractions, it kicks me back to the first attraction.  I then have to go through page after page to return to where I started.

I do like the map of those saved locations, however.  And the "near me now" will be useful when traveling.  I just find the rest of the app clumsy, and needing some work on making it more fluid and easier to use.  There were even a few attractions that Tripadvisor.com found, but the iPad app could not.  Weird.

This is a pretty good ap as long as you don't make the mistake of believing what you read and reserve a room through Trip Advisor's parent company, Hotels.com.  Folks, just get the telephone number from the hotel website and call the hotel direct. You will almost always get a substantially LOWER price.  

Now I see several more things that are now included in this ap that are beginning to defeat its purpose. The first is that inn owners can rebut the complaints of the reviewers, basically enabling the owners to call their customers liars. If you look through the reviews in any part of the country, you will see that this is going on. But that's not the most serious problem.  There is strong evidence that the so called top rated lodgings are asking their friends to submit bogus reviews that highly inflate the quality of their product, the object of which is to get so many good reviews that the establishment goes to the top of the ratings chart for that particular part of the country. For example, I know several of the bed and breakfast establishments in a town in Nova Scotia and one of the top three is clearly not of the caliber espoused by the so called reviewers. The owner of the establishment is using his spectacular Trip Advisor reviews as a major feature of his web page so he can gain a competitive advantage over his local competitors. How does Trip advisor audit the books to be sure these customers actually stayed there?  

There is no doubt in my mind that the owner of this place in Nova Scotia is writing the reviews himself and asking his friends from his former international work environment to send them in pretending that have stayed there. It doesn't take a genius to detect repetitive writing style, word usage, syntax and content in reviews that are supposedly written by different people from all over the world. There are no safeguards in this ap to protect customers from this sort of industry behavior. I wonder if reviewers are even informed that a bad business can grossly exaggerate its positive attributes and then categorically deny everything a reviewer writes and make the customer look like he's the one with a hidden agenda or a dishonest motive.

The other downside to this ap is that Trip Advisor edits or deletes reviews they don't like so that the ap is really a puff piece for the businesses rather than a service to customers. And, if I am correct, none of you will ever see this review of Trip Advisor either. The last time I complained about the inflation of pricing through Hotel.com, they refused to print the the review. 

I suggest you use Yelp. It's the real thing and exists to help customers make choices and book their rooms and reservations themselves. I believe the reviews on Yelp but not this misleading hotel booking gambit.

It was awesome.  
Food was hot, tasty, generous servings and price for all 4 people was under 60,00. We will be back!  Deerfeathers has been the best place in town so far and prices much lower than the other two paces

1/10/13.  As much as I appreciate and have used Trip Advisor, I am very close to putting it in my spam file.  I am getting way too many emails per week from Trip advisor.  I would have liked to make this comment privately, but Trip Advisor's site simply does not allow such.  So, please listen up: all those emails are driving me AWAY from this site, not toward it!

Could you please STOP offering me the free mobile app!!!  I have it!!!!!!!!!!!!

When checking hotels and restaurants online, I realized I was using trip advisor A LOT. So I decided to search for an app, not knowing if there was one or not. Happiness is !!!

On the last leg of a month long trip, I have only great things to say about TripAdvisor and all the reviewers.  We have eaten in very good restaurants the whole time, places we would have never known about otherwise. The hotel ratings have been very helpful also.

There are lots of options in other places for ranking hotels and restaurants, but if you really want to know about a place, just listen to someone who has been there!

PLUS I was just rewarded for placing my own reviews: a free Shutterfly photo book. Thank you!!!

I found this app great to know places or at least for reading reviews of hotels and restaurants before you visit them.this app is lacking several services performed in the web. It would be fantastic the app had a plan my trip functionality, instead of things to do (lacking schedules) but I remark the app and web site are sync'ed. Certainly better than yelp.

My son graduated from boot camp this weekend and you did not have much on your site to help me out so I thought I would send in my experience.
We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn, Lake Forest, Mettawa, IL. It was good but I would make plans to eat somewhere else. The location is great, near the highway and about 20 minutes from the Naval Command. 
Before you go to the graduation,you will have to print your parking pass utilizing the password. This is found on the Great Lkaes website.The password is in the initial form letter you child/relative sent to you right after they got to camp.
Graduation runs on time. Get there on time. We were there by 7:30 am. It started about 9am. You have to go through several check points. After the ceremony the recruits are now in the Navy and get to go on "Liberty" but must be returned to the base in their barracks by 9:30. They also have to meet a set of buddies at the visitors center so they are not walking alone and are accountable to each other. 
We ate at the "Full Moon Restaurant" a must I would say. They know everything about time lines and tradition. They were even taking yearbook /website pictures for the NTC when we were there. 
Otherwise my recruit just wanted to sleep. We went to "Ruth Chris's" in Northbrook for steak. Of course wonderful. They also made a big deal out of my recruit's sacrifice to serve his country and paid for his meal!!!! Everyone congratulated him and thanked him for his service. He was beaming. I think that was the high point of his weekend.

The interface leaves much to be desired (another app for the sake of putting a reminder logo in your ipad with no thought process for functionality or purpose) - other than quicker load of reviews compared to the heavy accessed tripadvisor.com website, i dont see this app doing much for a traveler. The search feature for one is completely primitive; a search for 'paris opera' suggests listings for opera house mexico....'paris bookstores' loses any notion of an answer. I hoped the saved items could collectively be viewed on the map. Thus far not any help and probably best uninstalled.

The new app for the iOS 7 is absolutely worthless now. You have no way to search for a place to have a nice dinner near a hotel or find things to do near your stay. Again worthless. This was our whole purpose for using this app. Need to fix this and put it back the way it was. Will not be using this until it's fixed. It used to be our go to travel app now it's crap.

Yes, it was glitchy on the iPad with iOS 7, but still incredibly useful. But with the update to iOS 7.0.3, the app will no longer open! Yesterday I would have rated it 4 stars, so I give 2 in hopes it's fixed ASAP.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 3
I have been using this app for a couple years, with iOS7 it is NOT that good. You can't look at menus for restaurants, the directions do not work as good. 
I have found amazing restaurants and B&Bs, but with the latest version I do not rely on it. Hopefully they will make it more useful. Can't wait until it gets better.

Sorry, but there was absolutely nothing wrong with the old version.  Then they tried to do an "ios7 friendly change" and honestly, it just blows.

Version 8.0.2 2013-11-06 1
Why have this app when you can just use the website from your phone KNOWING that you won't be surprised by some lack of functionality - Ex: ability to review reviews you have created in the past?!!!!

Note: I invested a maximum of 5 mins to look for this feature before I gave up on this assumption.

Making it worse would be the ongoing need to keep this app updated - sigh...pointless and a waste of bandwidth/time

This app should be put out of its misery....
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-07 1
Update 11/05/13:
Now a bloated piece of junk. "Advisor" does not mean book hotels, see menus, or any of the other crapola that has been added to this app. Time to locate a better app than this one. 

----------
Previously: 
Cannot add a business
Cannot report a name change for a business

Does not understand that a "nearby" business that is 25 miles away is not nearby, especially in a city like Chicago

Biased toward certain businesses, skipping past local businesses for "trendy", or "favored" businesses. Advertisers perhaps?

You can no longer move the map around and get new results in that new location. That was literally the only way I used the app, which made it awesome. With that now missing, I hate it.  5 star app down to 1 star in a single update. Really a shame, I hope this gets fixed.

Update: great that the map issue is now fixed.  Have the feeling it is very poorly programmed, very choppy and buggy.

**Update 11/30/13** much better, but where are my messages? I sometimes get questions or comments directed to me. Nice clean redesign but I don't see messages anywhere........

*2012 review*I used to really like the design, but this new Landscape only is not very user friendly. I don't remember but I thought I was able to upload photos before and now I can not from my iPad. I really like to share photos when I make a review and now I have to open the app on my iPhone just to upload images? Why do people always feel they need to mess with a good thing?? Great so the graphics are supporting the Retina display....wonderful.... But just make it like the website so we can upload and have more info at our fingers.. Thank you, and yes I love TripAdviser.

I find Yelp far more informative and helpful in the United States than is TripAdvisor. Yelp overseas, however (at least in the Philippines), has meager info. 
So I turned to TripAdvisor on the latest trip. Much more info and reports for the Philippines, but I found it laden with misinformation, which TripAdvisor cannot and will not correct.
One of a number of examples: TripAdvisor had multiple good reviews for a Greek restaurant in Metro Manila.  unfortunately, the address and the map locale on the website were off by miles! I spent a lot of wasted time searching for the place and gave up.
There is nothing within the TripAdvisor website to allow a user to either correct nor suggest corrections.  So I posted a review in which I specifically stated I did not eat there, but posted to inform others of the misinformation. Well, all reviews have to be approved by TripAdvisor before posting. They never did post my "review", but more importantly, they never corrected their misinformation concerning the location!
Similarly 3 other restaurants they reviewed had closed, two long ago.
Thankfully Yelp just announced an expansion into many nations including my beloved Philippines.

2/2014 addendum:  Trip Advisor continues to amaze me with misinformation, and the lack of ability for users to help them correct it.  Today's example: TripAdvisor states that Fresnos airport has 28 airlines operating out of it!   Common- Fresno? In fact there are only ten airlines. Try and fix that, though.

So I am glad that this has been adjusted to be able to look beyond the area. This is one of the best travel apps I have ever used. What I can't figure out is why can't I save any new places? If this can be looked into I would appreciate that it does not make sense if you can't save.thanks

On iPad iOS 7.  Why can't you release a version that works?!  On Forums, there is no way to go back to the previous 20 listings.  And the back button doesn't work.  It is also slow and crashes sometimes.  Do you guys even test your software?  Even the iPhone version works better than the iPad version.

What a great experience!  I didn't even want to get off the cruise ship but Rita & Mr. Cliffy made the best experience of our cruise.  It was the Eat, Drink & Dance tour, 3-21-14

Amazing
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 5
I use this app in conjunction with Expedia and hotels.com. I start looking for places to travel on tripadviser first to narrow down my options and check out what other travelers are saying about the area. Great app, awesome place to cross-reference reviews from other sites. Definitely recommend!
Version 5.6 2011-05-19 2
While this app provides great info, the app itself lacks stability.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4

You have no serious functions besides looking up stuff and even that's not smooth. Why login? It means nothing. I want to access my profile!!

Version 6.6 2012-11-08 1
Trip advisor web site is great -- but it's app dose not work with my iPhone 4.  I've installed it 3 times -- it works up until the "find" button is tapped -- then nothing happens.

how can the app not allow one to mark reviews as helpful like the web page

I spend 20 minutes writing and you toss it on sign in? Completely bogus - never again!

And who gives a crap about nicknames?

Or sucking up to face plant.
