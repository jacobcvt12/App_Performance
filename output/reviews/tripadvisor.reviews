Version 8.5 2014-04-01 5
The best app/site available for ratings of restaurants, hotels & attractions.  My primary resource for such things, especially when traveling.
Version 8.4.1 2014-04-01 5
My 'go to' travel app for everything from hotels and restaurants to flights and attractions!  Kudos!
Version 8.5 2014-03-31 5
This app and website are the greatest for anything related to travel. Period. No others comes close, don't fool yourself.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-31 5
Tight
Version 8.5 2014-03-31 5
Love this app for it's speed, it's reviews and it's recommendations.  Full spectrum of travel info.
Excellent!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-31 5
A great site for finding new and exciting restaurants and reasonable and clean hotels. I love to read the reviews. You get a good sampling of experiences and can decide for yourself--try it or skip it.
Version 8.5 2014-03-31 5
Im loving this app and site. The forum is beyond useful and so far it a breeze to find my way. I'm sure it will be a necessity for my trip
Version 8.5 2014-03-31 1
It locks up. Crashes when you are typing even in the login screens.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-31 5
I love Trip Advisor and recommend it to everyone.  I love to check and see what other people say about places before I go.  Word Of Mouth in an app 24/7!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-31 4
This version is a lot friendlier and gives very televant info.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-31 2
I was very disappointed that  this mobile app doesn't let you add pictures to your review.  It needs adjusting.
Version 8.0.2 2014-03-31 5
This is one of the most user friendly apps I've experienced.  Having it at my thumbs allows me to submit reviews while the experience is fresh.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-31 5
Easy to use and navigate.
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 4
Looks much nicer on a PC or laptop but enough info to be helpful.
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 1
The mobile website is better than the App. This has bad UI, can't search for hotels when selecting a region. It only shows random picks.
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 5
I use this app in conjunction with Expedia and hotels.com. I start looking for places to travel on tripadviser first to narrow down my options and check out what other travelers are saying about the area. Great app, awesome place to cross-reference reviews from other sites. Definitely recommend!
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 5
I was TripAdvisor-obsessed before my 2012 trip to Ireland. It was my secret weapon for a great trip! Reviews and travel forums cover EVERYTHING you'd want to know before you make an important decision. I found it amazing how SOMEONE had always asked the same (or similar) question and could help me out. So I'm determined to pay it back with reviews whenever I can ... And a thorough review of MY Ireland trip. Thanks, TripAdvisor!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-30 5
Very helpful. Easy to use. Reliable.
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 5
I use Yelp a lot and came across this app recently. Excellent comments from road warriors like me. 
I will cross check the two apps and know for sure I'm landing at a great spot visited by those in the know!
Big thumbs up!

Version 8.5 2014-03-30 2
Takes too long to load. Once it's loaded, it works fine. I often return to mobile site rather than wait on this app.
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 5
This is a great app for reviewing as well as finding good restaurants and hotels. I have not used it much for attractions.
Version 8.5 2014-03-30 4
iPhone app doesn't let me add new restaurants.  Otherwise, it is a very useful app for travelers.  But, I now enter new properties on Yelp instead of TripAdvisor.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-29 4
I used this site constantly when researching places to visit
It's easy
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-25 5
Simple, informative traveling companion for wandering a new city.
Version 8.5 2014-03-25 2
Tried to write a review for a hotel, but couldn't because it wasn't two hundred characters! A review does not have to be a novel to be effective.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-25 5
Food was great and Elize our server was awesomr
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 5
Real reviews, real photos. You can actually find out about restaurants & hotels not just the skewed marketing scheme put forth by the establishment.

Rarely use the website anymore as the app is so much better! Great travel advice and when you enter a place the practical aspects hotels, restaurants and attractions quickly pop up so you can get an idea of whether it's worth visiting  or not.
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 5
This is a fantastic app. Reviews are up to date and seemingly fair. Zero issues.
Version 8.4 2014-03-24 1
App is slow and functions oddly. Wish I never downloaded this version.
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 1
After the last update, the app is totally destroyed, hard to use, and the businesses on the map are in the wrong places.
Version 8.2 2014-03-24 5
I am travelling in middle east and this app is life saver when it comesto find restaurants
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 5
Good for planning.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-24 5
I want information about places both near and far. With this easy to navigate app, I get answers to my questions in no time. Hotels, attractions, and restaurants (to name those I look up most) are easy to find and have reviews attached.
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 5
This is one of my favorite apps. It never freezes and very easy to navigate. So nice to have T. A. one touch away to plan trips or review a destination. Thank You for another great app!
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-24 5
I have used this app on all our trips and it's fantastic!
Version 8.5 2014-03-24 5
I use it all the time when I travel on business and pleasure to find hotels and restaurants.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-23 2
Better to go online to full site.  App is not worth the time.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-23 5
You get honest review of people who have been there. You are able to weed our the whiners. I use this when I travel. I leave reviews wherever I go
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-23 5
Trip Advisor is our "go to" app whenever we travel.  Thank you for making our travels so much of a pleasure.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-23 4
So far so good, seems to work good.
Version 8.5 2014-03-23 5
Prefect to find things near you or right before you go on a trip
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-23 3
I am having a really hard time finding camping sites with this app.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-23 5
Very useful app while out of town.
Version 8.5 2014-03-23 4
We use this anytime we are going out whether at home or on vacation. Only suggestion (not a complaint) would be to allow individual ratings for price atmosphere and service on the app like the main webpage.
Version 8.5 2014-03-21 5
A great way to find out what normal people think about places and find the best places to experience when traveling.
Version 8.5 2014-03-21 5
Planning my trip to Vegas and found plenty to do off this app...thanks
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-21 5
Love Trip Advisor for the great reviews!! Always check here when I am doing my trip planning research.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-21 5
Great
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-20 5
I use TripAdvisor before every trip, business or personal.   Great access to hotel, restaurant and attraction information and details.   Reviews are very helpful and forums allow for great access to individualized reference when needed.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-20 4
I love Trip Advisor, but come on--I use my iPad in Landscape mode all the time. It took about 20 minutes to finally find out that the Save feature is only available in Portrait mode. Really?  How cumbersome. Please fix this!
Version 8.5 2014-03-20 4
I love this app because you know the truth about a hotel before you book.  It avoids nasty surprises.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-20 5
It is really amazing app, I think we need it all the time. High recommended !!
Version 8.5 2014-03-20 2
This app seems like it's just mobile website stuffed in a wrapper.  Trying to load photos , especially after a filter will glitch and send you back a few steps. Very silo'd, difficult to navigate in and out of hotels in areas.... View photos and hit done, bam you are back to the start.   

Not sure why it has four stars.
Version 8.5 2014-03-19 5
Never again do I have an excuse. The reviews help me make good decisions whether traveling with the family or on business.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-19 5
I love this app! Cheapest deals around!
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-19 5
I am on the road constantly. I use this app almost every day from places to eat to places to stay. Wouldn't leave home without it. Now excuse me, I have to find a place for dinner!
Version 8.5 2014-03-19 5
This app is one that never leaves my iphone. I can rate, review, and reserve the hotels I stay at. 
Thank you for making it easy to use.
Version 7.0.1 2014-03-19 4
Tapas Restaurant. Delicious!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-19 5
I use the trip advisor website to research hotels but this App is great for finding restaurants using "near me now" function.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-19 4
If I can sign in, is there any reason I can't access my messages?  Pretty good app overall otherwise.
Version 8.5 2014-03-19 5
This is very well done, I've had no issues with it and the information is accurate.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-19 5
The path to find and locate best affordable place to stay ...be it hotel or hostel or whatever  ...this app is excellent ...Barry Cohen.
Version 8.5 2014-03-19 4
Trip Advisor is a great resource when trying to decide on a hotel or restaurant, or exploring a new city. Only downside is that average reviewers often don't seem to know much about ethnic cuisine, so their opinions are not very helpful if you are an adventurous diner likee.
Version 8.5 2014-03-19 5
Must have for anyone looking for traveling advice from people that has experienced the places.
Version 8.5 2014-03-18 5
I love this app. When ever I travel anywhere, I rely on the reviews of others and am never disappointed!!
Version 8.5 2014-03-18 5
I don't go anywhere without looking in TA first. Also makes it easy to review places for others.
Version 8.5 2014-03-18 2
.... This site can claim to be unbiased .  Yes it does allow guest to be a helping hand on status of properties.  But yet some reviews are not getting out up on sites even when they are 5 star.  Also the categories for food places in some city's don't make sense.  They should have a better break down. Example how can a chocolate lounge be rated #4 restaurant when there is really no savory food served there.  Or a hotel that hasn't had a review in over two months still be #1 when the #2 spot has been consistently getting reviews.  Doesn't make sense.   I just think the site has some minor flaws that can be fixed to make it definitely the best.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-18 5
I absolutely love this app, and wouldn't travel without it.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-18 3
App can be improved by featuring accepted credit cards at establishments, especially restaurants. This would be helpful to those of us that carry corporate American Express cards which are not widely accepted as other credit cards due to higher merchant fees charged by American Express.  Otherwise the App is a helpful tool to multiple city travelers.
Version 8.3.1 2014-03-15 1
Cannot comment on food. Having been told that the wait will be another 20 minutes, after we already sat for 47 min, we left.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
We use this app all the time to find things to do and restaurants around us along with traveler reviews.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5

Long gone are the days of awful surprises!  Love this app, but remember....it's only as good as it's members!!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
I really enjoy hearing what other reviewers think of the different places. I also really like the ability to add my own thoughts and experiences so others can choose to enjoy or avoid according to my review.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 3
Why can't we add photos on the mobile version? Huge omission. Otherwise great.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 4

Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
We use it a lot!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
Love this app! Helps me find great places for my family to visit that we might not know about. This app has never failed to find us great places to go and it's so easy!
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
Use it all the time. A must have for all vacationers.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
The Tripadvisor app has made finding local places a breeze. From reading to writing reviews, this app allows you to quickly search  what others are saying about a particular business. 

TIP: Use it when you're out of town to find those local, highly rated restaurants. So far, it's been correct 100% of the time.
Version 8.5.1 2014-03-15 5
Me encanta
Version 7.1.1 2014-03-15 1
What a joke! This place is a mockery and anything but holy. Don't keep funding these televangeliars! TBN destroyed a decent place.

Never leave without consulting trip advisor
Version 8.5 2014-03-15 5
This is an amazing app. I have used it in the US as well as in Europe. I have been extremely pleased with the results and have found places that I otherwise would not have found.
Version 8.5 2014-03-14 5
Easy to use. Best travel app available.
Version 8.5 2014-03-14 5
Trip Advisor has become our primary trusted source for restaurant guidance wherever we travel. We don't always agree with a rating, but we haven't found any other resource that approaches its universality and accuracy.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-14 5
good stuff
Version 8.5 2014-03-13 5
I love this app.  It's reliable and whenever I dig or dislike a place, it is a snap to provide a review.  When I see the recommended sign in a window, I am happy to stop.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-13 4
The update took away a few of the functions from the app I really enjoyed.  For example it was a summary of all the major points of the reviews. Loved it. Made things easier. But it's all still good.
Version 8.5 2014-03-13 5
I love this app. Has good information and the reviews are helpful
Version 8.5 2014-03-13 5
We rely on Trip Advisor when traveling a lot and feel confident in the information we receive. We have had many good experiences using their rating system and apparently unbiased reviews. Thanks for this service!
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-09 4
I love this.... It helps me an my family when we are traveling. We walk in like we are locals!
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
Such a helpful travel site!
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 3
Once you sign up, they start. Sending you "deals" that simply push other websites.  Not like Travelzoo or others that has true deals.  They are also now actively redirecting your searches for info on a city to hotel booking pages.  You have to search so much harder to locate reviews. Unfortunately this website seems to be moving away from sharing reviews and moving towards actively generating money through redirecting you to booking websites and false "deals".
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
We travel allot and regularly use TripAdvisor for our dinner and events.  They send me updates on who has found my review helpful.  Feels like a real family.
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
This is an amazing app for anyone who's traveling. It's great to see pictures and opinions from guests.
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
Definitely helps when it's needed, and fun to see different areas in ones own town.
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
I do not plan any trip without using trip advisor.  The app works very well and is updated constantly!  I would 100% recommend trip advisor.
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
Gives you an easy way to find the best restaurants, attractions, etc. all in one place.  Nice way to "discover" new places.  We are loving it!
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 5
Thanks!
Version 8.5 2014-03-09 1

Version 8.5 2014-03-08 5
This is a very good app. Always good to know what people have to say about a site before stopping by
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 4
I love this app although I wish it would give you the total price of multiple travelers and not just the individual price
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 5
Does what I need it to do. Thanks.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-08 4
I like the reviews and took the time to add one myself for hotel after the first use. Some filters are missing compared with other search engines.
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 5
When in doubt, ask a friend.  That is what TripAdvisor is to me when travelling.
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 5
Great app
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 5
I love this app. I've only had it a few minutes but I checked out everything in my local town. And it seems to work great
Version 8.5 2014-03-08 5
This is a great tool when traveling in both scenarios - impromptu (so figuring out the place while there) and planning before the trip. It's been wonderfully helpful.
Version 8.5 2014-03-07 3
Love the website, and I think the app is beautiful, but I cannot "Add to Trip" from the app like I can from the website.  Odd because I can access "My Saves" from the app, but there is no button for any of the hotels, restaurants, attractions, etc to allow me to save.  Allowing me to keep track of the things I want to do on my particular trip is what I think makes Trip Advisor useful.  Until I can do that the app isn't of much use to me.
Version 8.5 2014-03-07 5
Is really simple to use, and give you a lot of place to go.
Version 8.5 2014-03-07 5

Version 8.5 2014-03-07 2
Noisy! The boiler sounds like a plane turbine every 10-15 minute cycle, accompanied by whiffs of natural gas, and we can hear everyone's bath water gurgling. Curtains installed over, not beside, the windows block the view. And NO comfortable chairs or lazy boy, just stiff sofa and oversize chair. Nice pool and hot tub and exercise room, but NO resort activities.

I'm an active user of the TripAdvisor site and now from their app. I use it on a daily basis... I try new restaurants every other day and the reviews are 100% accurate. The app works well, it's easy to use and and it's a great tool to advise and suggest places near me. I access the TA app mora then my own social media apps.
Version 8.4 2014-03-06 5
I use it all the time when I'm trying to navigate and find the best restaurants and lodging in the mean streets of Compton, California
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-06 4
Whenever I travel I use tripadvisor.  However I like the website better than the app.  If I visit a restaurant or hotel that's not already on tripadvisor I cannot add it from the app.  I have to send the request on the website. By the time I have access to a computer I've already forgotten.
Version 8.5 2014-03-06 3
When using this app throughout the world, it is often frustrating to use the app because there is little or no internet. The database of addresses do not necessarily correctly map to locations in many places. Otherwise a very useful tool.
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-06 5
Great in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, everywhere!
Version 8.5 2014-03-06 5
Great app! Love it!
Version 8.5 2014-03-06 4
I love the Trip Advisor website. The Mobil app is very good for when you're on the road, but would be great if it had more of the individualized content of the full website.  Either way, I appreciate what Trip Advisor provides and remain a loyal fan!
Version 8.5 2014-03-05 5
I have grown to seriously appreciate the value of trip advisor. I find the reviews very useful. I think what is particularly important is the trip advisor does not edit or specifically delete reviews. In contrast, yelp will post some and delete others in a very troubling fashion. I know longer contribute to yelp because I think they have a hidden agenda; it might have something to do with purchasing advertising on their site. I'll stick with trip adviser. They are more honest and the reviews more useful.
Version 8.5 2014-03-05 4
I love it, use it often for travel!!!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-03-05 4
It would be helpful if the app allowed you to access more of your own information.
For instance, I am unable to respond to other traveler inquiries unless (inbox) unless on the actual site.
My only other disappointment with the app is that instead of having one simple well rounded app, there is this one plus all of the other add-on apps.
It would be great to have everything in one place instead of several.
Version 8.5 2014-03-05 5
Always excellent for hotels and restaurants. Now I've booked a vacation rental in Paris, through TripAdvisor App, and am very pleased.
Version 8.5 2014-03-05 5
My husband and I were on our way home after he had just had eye surgery. We were tired and hungry and happened to see Miguel's. We were surprised to see the parking lot almost full and on a Monday night! We thought this was a good sign to give it a try. We were so pleased that we did. It was so impressive how the staff supported one another. The food was delicious and prepared with pride. We will certainly return soon and be sure to tell our friends. Thank you Sean

This app has been reliable and quick.  It has missed a couple of good deal found on others but overall it has been good.  A good start on your search for the perfect trip.

Indispensable tool for trip planning, flight booking and reviewing your favorite points of interest. A solid and very necessary tool for travel photographers and journalist!

Essential to maximize any vacation experience.
Version 8.5 2014-03-04 5
I use trip advisor all the time for eating out when traveling and at home. It's fun to look at local places you have never eaten at and then go to them.
Version 8.5 2014-03-04 5
Great food, drinks & service! It's a good idea to think ahead and make reservations, but not always necessary. We have eaten there for lunch & supper on multiple occasions and have no complaints. Each chef's favorite creation is a must to try. You will not be disappointed.
Version 8.5 2014-03-04 5
Works the way it should. No problems, love it.

Good place nearby to eat.

This app is a must have for every iPhone

Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 5
Traveling south each fall we use this app before we decide where to stop and we have never been led wrong. We also check for restaurants as we prepare to pull in for the night. Saves wasting time and money and much more accurate than asking for recommendations at the front desks!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 4
This app is our most used travel app. Hotels, attractions, maps, etc. - everything I save when planning on line shows up and we're good to go.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 5
I've relied on TripAdvisor for recommendations all over the world. On other travel sites, you can quickly tell which reviews are written by fellow travelers and which are written by shills. TripAdvisor does a great job presenting honest reviews, letting you decide for yourself what's best. If you like the site, start writing reviews. It's a fascinating experience.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 3
Fine app when browsing the restaurants, but what really made me angry is that you cannot access saved places when offline?!? I couldn't see the address of restaurants as I did not have the internet connection when I visited Italy.

Useless without net!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-20 5
Trip Advisor is the must have travel companion! It's even a lot of fun to rate you're local restaurants, hotels, & recreational hang outs. Couldn't live without this app.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-19 5
Not the best site for searching prices for hotels, but the best when it comes to reviews
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-19 5
I love using my app for dinner ideas and location.  Also finding what things are going on at my location.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-19 5
Love this app. Easy to use and works great to find the best deals.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-19 5
I never have wifi while looking for a hotel so I can never read reviews before I go to a place but oh well that's more my fault....other than that I love reviewing hotels I stay at this will probably be the last night I use the app for a little while but that is just because I do not stay in hotels that often only when I'm on vacation once or maybe twice a year for 2-4 weeks.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-19 5
I travel internationally and use this app all the time. Really good app.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-19 5
Great App start to explore your own state you will find hidden treasures and place!! Must have app!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-18 5
A+
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-18 4
Solid on iPhone.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-18 5
I love that the reviews are by actually travelers and locals alike. Would use over yelp any day.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5
This app is great! It does all of the research for you! We always use it and have been using TA for many years. It hasn't failed us once! I would love a Spa Review place as well it is so hard to find amazing spas.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 1
I have changed currency to local to see the prices and the app refuses to leave this currency back to $US. 
I have changed it back, reloaded and it insists on this on local currency for any hotel in the world.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5
Very easy to locate places to eat, play, and stay
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5
This place is very autentic!!food excelent and good price!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5
So easy , user friendly to use I love it !
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-17 2
This is a trimmed down version of the website but it is very clunky and not good for writing reviews.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5
So nice to have an informational source that can be trusted. I check all my travel locations here before I book!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5
Awesome app
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-17 5
Since trip advisor is recognized as the most common site for traveling, this app makes trip planning so much easier.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
I use this everywhere we go including around home. It's very helpful and I love reading what others think and I like to leave my reviews also. Great app!
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-16 5
Have used this app for years as our sole source of reviews of hotels, resorts, restaurants and things to do by real people, including their pictures so you get authentic information m
Version 8.4 2014-02-16 5
The reviews don't lie... I love this app
Version 8.4 2014-02-16 1
Dear tripadvisor,

If you're wondering why all of your traveler photos are from 2010 and prior, it's bc your photo submission software is outdated. You only allow 5mb per picture which is too small for 20mp cameras in 2014 and in itself unnecessary. Follow Facebook, Flickr and other sites that automatically compress large photos to optimize, the result being very small files that are more than sufficient for viewing on your site. Also make it easier to post from the app. Too many errors.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
I never plan a trip or eat at a new restaurant without checking Trip Advisor. I also use Flip Key to rent houses. Excellent travel site.
Version 8.1.1 2014-02-16 5
We use it all the time, even in places we know just to jog our memory.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 4
Great App! Perfect for strangers who have no idea of a new place.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
I like using Trip Advisor when traveling or sometimes around home for new ideas. Easy to use.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 2
I find Yelp far more informative and helpful in the United States than is TripAdvisor. Yelp overseas, however (at least in the Philippines), has meager info. 
So I turned to TripAdvisor on the latest trip. Much more info and reports for the Philippines, but I found it laden with misinformation, which TripAdvisor cannot and will not correct.
One of a number of examples: TripAdvisor had multiple good reviews for a Greek restaurant in Metro Manila.  unfortunately, the address and the map locale on the website were off by miles! I spent a lot of wasted time searching for the place and gave up.
There is nothing within the TripAdvisor website to allow a user to either correct nor suggest corrections.  So I posted a review in which I specifically stated I did not eat there, but posted to inform others of the misinformation. Well, all reviews have to be approved by TripAdvisor before posting. They never did post my "review", but more importantly, they never corrected their misinformation concerning the location!
Similarly 3 other restaurants they reviewed had closed, two long ago.
Thankfully Yelp just announced an expansion into many nations including my beloved Philippines.

2/2014 addendum:  Trip Advisor continues to amaze me with misinformation, and the lack of ability for users to help them correct it.  Today's example: TripAdvisor states that Fresnos airport has 28 airlines operating out of it!   Common- Fresno? In fact there are only ten airlines. Try and fix that, though.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
Easy to use and helpful!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 4
I love being able to search hotels and attractions and then being able to save information that would be relevant to my trip planning.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
Can't go wrong with this one.... as any other app... you have to play with it... navigate around and it's simple to do. Very Informative! And I love it... as do the family and friends I've asked to try this app. Thank you
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-16 5
I have been using the web version for quite sometime and was stoked to find the app. I love all of the ways to search through the places I'll visit. So easy to navigate.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
I am a traveling pro, commercial pilot dropping in anywhere anytime.  When I want a quick close meal, or if I don't have to walk a better selection TA IS RIGHT ON.  Extremely consistently reliable.  Worth it all the way
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
Awesome app & a must for travelers. Very easy app to navigate. Highly recommend !!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
I travel a lot and in almost every town I go, this app comes in very handy. I have used it all over the US, England and Wales. I have found some incredible food, awesome beers and wines. Thank you to the other travelers that have honestly, objectively given reviews. Highly recommend if you love to travel
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
Love this app
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 1
This app fails at it's most basic function. Not sure why this app exists if I can't check availability by date.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 4
Just hope it maintains its roots and doesn't go too corporate and commercial on us
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 4
I use tripadvisor all the time.  I love having the app on the phone it's also great while I'm traveling.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
I use this app when ever I travel! Very good to find attractions and hotels
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
First used this app when I traveled to a resort area. Very helpful in scouting out top eateries, accomadations, attractions. I love it! Helps prevent expensive time wasting mistakes.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
Nothing more needed to say, TA is awesome.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 3
Could get the current version to work and had to delete it with all my settings. Reload seems to have fixed everything except having to redo all my settings. Working so far.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
This application. Just keeps getting better. Honest reviews you can trust. I have been using this app for a long time, always checking before going and it is pretty accurate. I really like the near me now feature. I even started writing reviews.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 5
I always use trip advisor especially when out of town! Great app never fails!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-15 4
Not as good as full site but getting there
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 4
Find this site very helpful in looking up information !! Today was the 1st day in couple mts I have been able to rate in on my mobile yeah!!! Glad it has been fixed on the upgrade was always getting a submit sign in symbol error.   Its a great app.  Get it you will love it :)
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 5
Always up to date and useful info.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 4
Great to use to find a room or restaurant while traveling in Europe! Thanks! The reviews help narrow down the search tremendously!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 4
I like this ap - earning badges is kinda fun. I did not give it 5 stars because it is somewhat clunky. I.E. It is not easy to search in an area different from your current location.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 4
I use trip advisor when is travel international to Europe or Central America for hotels and general dining.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-14 5
Just what the world traveler needs to keep businesses honest and thriving! Go humans, go.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
Amazing people!  Wait on you hand and foot!  Luis and Carlos are the best waiters.  Alex and Alice worked hard to find our lost luggage.  Our favorite was Isaias!  He helped us with our excursions.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 3
I like the app, but it won't let you click on links in posts on the forum.  I find that it's easier to just use the website where links are clickable.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
I use this app and website for all things related to travel. It never let's me down.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
I travel locally and on the road with this! Never leave home without it. The reviewers are on target 99.9% of the time.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
I used this app to assist me in planning my family vacation. I found it very useful in finding not only a great hotel, but also lots of family oriented things to do on our trip to San Francisco. Much easier to navigate then just searching the web. Great job.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
Very useful app!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5
Any trip I plan, I check Trip Advisor first when booking lodging. I have been using this website for many, many years and it has never steered me wrong. Checking the reviews and member photos of properties that Im considering always helps me make the right decision as to where I will stay. Thank you so much for the handy app. I now use this all the time and have saved many travel disappointments by using it!!!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-13 5

Easy to use, understand, read and write in. Truly is a solid app.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 5
Unlike Yelp, Trip Advisor will not pull reviews in an effort to make more $ by selling them back to the business owner. It's inconceivable that such a practice is legal.  Back to Trip Advisor.  I can always count on finding good, honest recommendations for restaurants, hotels and fun activities.  And people like me who love to travel have the best perspective on such things; you can find us here!  I wouldn't use anything else!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 1
When searching for all area attractions, you always have to use your current location otherwise, providing a city either returns no results or only a few results. This is highly annoying because I would like to review area attractions in other cities. The app is useless if I can't do that.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 5
Always dependable. Many great finds because of app. It's the people way to express concerns good or bad.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 5

This is my go-to whenever we're on vacation, traveling for work, or just out and about town. Especially after "Where do you wanna go?" -- "I don't know where do you wanna go?" Happens for 20 minutes!!  Thanks to the handy locator, ideas, and reviews!
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-09 3
I travel a lot and the older app made it much easier to submit a new restaurant that was not shown in trip advisor.  Seems like this new version is set up more for people who don't write reviews.

I use this app all over the world and it has never failed me.

A friend used this when we were on a trip in kentucky and found it berry useful to find off the beaten path places and navigate to the place.  This has become one of my favorite apps of late.  Wouldn't go to a new place without it.
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-09 5

Can't see my bookings or my messages or anything else about my account
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-08 4
They really need to improve the search capabilities. It just isn't intuitive. If I want to find restaurants in a certain city it takes some some doing. I am sure it will just keep getting better though. The 'near me now' works great!
Version 8.3.1 2014-02-08 4
Great app to use prior to visiting a new place.
Version 8.4.1 2014-02-08 1
I saved a number of places, restaurants, etc for 2 upcoming trips. Now, when I try to locate them, TA tells me I have to login, then transfers me automatically to Google Maps, WITHOUT ALLOWING ME TO LOGIN ANYWHERE! How can I find my Saves if you won't let me login??? Total fail, completely useless.

I use this App almost daily for finding restaurants and hotels.

I work in the IT business and I am constantly traveling all over the western part of the United States, and I love using this app to check out hotels and see what other people have to say about the places I'm staying at. I have yet to stay at a hotel where the rating on trip advisor was wrong. Love being able to see photos uploaded by real guest and not a photo shopped picture of the best room in the whole hotel.
Version 8.4 2014-02-03 5
Very good app that provides information for the traveler in any city.
Version 8.4 2014-02-03 5

I love Trip Advisor and depend on it for great travel ideas. After I updated, the App won't open at all. Be careful about updating, especially if you don't have the newest OS. I now have no app access at all.
Version 8.4 2014-02-02 1
Installed latest iPad update. App crashes immediately and will not open. Tough to use when you keep getting the iPad home screen. I agree with previous posts that successive updates have made this app cumbersome. Very unfortunate.

Been using Trip Advisor for a year now and I love the website. App seems just as good. We've used it for hotels, restaurants, and places to visit. As a recently retired traveler I appreciate this site/app and never leave home without it. Also been using it to find restaurants in our home town that aren't our Ursula's.

Love TripAdvisor as a website but the iPad App is almost useless.  The reason is that the programmers decided to create intrusive floating frames to obtain your travel information before you even decide to take a trip or not.  Therefore, an otherwise wonderful experience is completely destroyed by these frames that keep floating over everything you do and are looking at.  They just get in the way so do yourself a favor and avoid this app if you can and simply go online
Version 8.4 2014-02-01 4
Good app with a ton of reviews. I wish there was a way to push maps and addresses to txt or email for off line reference. Also local spelling (China) for taxis. In a size they can see/read from a phone.
Version 8.4 2014-02-01 5
The app is well designed and easy to use. The content for the travel locations was right on.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-16 1

I love Trip advisor and it is always very helpful when I travel out of town. It is so much easier to find a good restaurant or attraction when I'm in an unfamiliar city with this app.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 3
This app is great at what it currently does, but I, along with everyone else I'm sure, desperately want the ability to edit account settings, view badges, etc. In summary, we want the app to do everything the website does.

More a 2.5 rating - I have higher expectations for tripadvisor

I'm sure it's optimized for saving and searching hotels and restaurants but I downloaded this specifically for rental searches and it's a super frustrating thing to:
1. Not be able to save those I am considering renting 
2. See those available on a nap all
At once 
3. What the heck is up with the last search not saving?! (Which brings ms to my next gripe)...
4. The "home" vs "back" button - just a BAD design. Make them different colors. Put them on opposite sides if the screen... Do something to make it more obvious so I don't wreck it all by mistaking my pressing home. If my prior list just came back w a forward button it would be fine!
5. Why, if you ask me about my dates that I am searching for, do you include rentals that do NOT have those dates available?! 

Fix all these things and u will be rewarded w 5 stars.

Awesome

I make all our family travel plans, US and overseas.  Trip advisor is my primary research tool.  I normally have trip advisor open on one devise while working with my reservations on another.  Trip Advisor has NEVER led us wrong!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 5
Excelente app, recomendada muy util
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 4
I can save my preferred hotels etc on my iPhone but there's no place to save on the iPad. You can see your previously saved ones, but can't add. 

Lame. Other than that, great app.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 5
This app provides wealth of information and reviews about any place I'm visiting or plan to visit. The reviews provide dependable guidance on things of interest, hotels, restaurants.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 2
I truly wish this app weren't so buggy.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 1
We travel a lot and always use TA.  The main web site that is.  We HATE this app because all it does is drive traffic to your paying sponsors.  Your main site is still wonderful but we have difficulty finding it when using our Ipad...this darn app keeps popping up.  And what's most aggravating is when I finally manage to find your main site, that we love, and bookmark it...guess what?  When we hit the bookmark, expecting the main site, this crazy app appears instead!  What are you guys doing?   Fix it so that if someone bookmarks the main site we can avoid this useless app.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 5
There is not to much to say the app and the service are great. The best travel companion and event in town it provides you with tons of options.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 1
I'm giving this one more chance. Takes forever to open and forever to search.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 1
Will not let me login with Facebook, when clicking on FB login button, nothing happens; Will not let me post reviews, receive error message that I must login which according to settings, I'm already logged in; If I click login button on the error message, I'm directed to the Google Maps app...really?  Have no idea what TA is up to but after last up is nothing short of dreck.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-15 4
I LOOOOOVE TA!! And their app makes it that much easier for me to hop around the world.  The latest release is a bit buggy though. When you click the "star" to add to favorites, it tries to open the map and directions.  That is a vital piece of the app, please fix. :)
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-14 5
Muy buena app
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-14 4
I found Trip Advisor very useful and well designed, much better that other travel apps for domestic travel like Expedia for example.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-14 5
Amazing
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-14 2
Great info on TA but this app needs a lot of improvement. On iPad 2 doesn't save info when switching apps, unlike on the iPhone, or when app auto-closes.
Version 8.3 2014-01-09 5
I'm a frequent TripAdvisor contributor and I use it to check reviews for our many travels. Great app for both.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 5

Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 4
Use this app every time we travel. Good information.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 5
I am a frequent reviewer and find this a reliable tool for finding, or double checking places I've found on other sites. I do have problems adding travel articles due to a glitch between TA and IE. Valuable since we travel 365 days a year.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 4
We use Trip Advisor ALL of the time! I love reading the reviews and hearing other peoples opinions. I especially like reading the "terrible" reviews to try and figure out whether or not the reviewer is just disgusted with life in general. The owner responses are a special touch and I understand wanting to comment, but sometimes it's just not necessary. I especially love the app when I need a last minute suggestion, always very helpful. Thanks Trip Advisor!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 3
I like and use the app a lot.  But every time I try something new on it, it doesn't work. I opened the app and input a restaurant review. When submitted, it says that I'm not logged in. I hit the Login button and nothing happens. My app settings show that I'm logged in. I had to submit the review on Safari. I have iPhone 5 with latest iOS and trip advisor app v831.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-09 5

I use this app more than any other.  It is such a help to read real reviews of hotels and eating establishments especially when in a new area.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 1
Here's your 1-Star!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 4
I used to love this app, but now I find it hard to search for specific places to see how they're rated, only cities. Also the phone numbers are no longer listed, so I have to look them up on the internet, meaning I have to leave the app. Please put it back the way it was.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 5
Been looking for an app like this
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 1
This app is slow and buggy. Had to sign in twice to access my saves and then was not able to add new searches to saves (no save button). Don't waste your time with the app.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 1
Always get a login error. Can't rate, can't do anything!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 4
We spend about eight months a year traveling in our camper/trailer and our pick up. We use trip advisor every chance we get, not only for campgrounds, but for restaurants and activities in the areas we are going to. Trip adviser is also very helpful in finding out about our national parks and monuments, and other areas to see as we travel. Highly recommended!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 5
I have used this app countless times while traveling the reviews are very helpful, I have joined TA with reviews the more people review the better the app. Best traveling app.

I have been using this app for a long time, I love it!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 3
It is that you cannot sort the reviews by the type of reviewer. I am more prone to listen to a top contributor than to the odd reviewer that has written 1 review and is probably linked to the establishment he reviewed
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 5
very easy, nessesary for overseas trip.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-08 5

I use TripAdvisor a lot during my travels, and I enjoy helping other travelers by writing my own reviews.  This app makes it all so easy.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 5
I use this for keeping up on work. It works well I wish it had the management account on it though!!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 4
About as good as it gets for travel sites to date. When they can add social features like connecting me to interesting locals that have similar interests to mine this will be very very hot!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 4
I enjoy writing reviews and reading others. They help me know what something is really like instead of only having the website to decide if it's worth a visit. 
App is easy to use searching for reviews and submitting reviews and photos!
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-07 4
I would only recommend that the user interface and navigation is beefed up and made a little more enhanced and user friendly.
Version 8.3 2014-01-07 4

Version 8.3.1 2014-01-06 2
Why can't you make it capable of staying on the last place or page used if user has to go away from the app to do something else?  Stupid lack of functionality...

Often I just go to Safari and use the web app to insure that I don't have to start all over again for my search using the iPad app.  

There is some good functionality but it is far from wholly useable.  The map search is pretty good, but still has some issues if geo-coding isn't right...

Can't just cut over and use only this... Still reliant on the web browser version... What's the point if you have to use two pieces of software?

Also, it is really annoying when wifi drops and app goes back to the beginning...makes me want to pull my hair out.
Version 8.3.1 2014-01-06 5
I use this app anytime I am in a new place and I'm lookin for a good place to eat! The reviews are all very helpful. Great app!

Excellent location in the Inner harbor, almost in front of the Maryland Science center 2 blocks from Orioles stadium and Aquarium. City and hotel are family friendly. Plus the hotel have a great tennis and basketball court plus and a Small Pool which picture are not included in Travelocity. But the best is the staff's courtesy , and the most valuable concierge  ever Mr. Jonathan B Knox, thank you so much for your hospitality, caring and professionalism.

Love this app!  Easy and straight forward to use.

Version 8.3 2014-01-02 5
Great app when traveling
Trip Advisor is the future for not only travel reviews but also will become a booking engine. The only one thing is of you are a business owner and you receive reviews that are not real it is very hard to get a dishonest review removed and it can hurt your business. I am not sure hoe trip advisor can monitor this better but it has to change to get honest reviews.
Version 8.3 2014-01-02 5
Used for restaurants and hotels to find the best options and has been spot on accurate so far.  Will continue to use and recommend to others

Version 8.3 2014-01-01 3
I don't know why it is such a stripped down version of the website. And why it allows such limited access to those logged in.
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 3
I like the app and I am starting to use it more and more. Need to know how to add places to review. Great way to find things to do.
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 2
App has this ridiculous requirement that reviews have to be 200 characters at least. Fine, but it keeps saying I haven't written enough, when it's clear I've written more than 400 characters!  So it's useless to try to write a review with this app. I wonder what else might be malfunctioning.
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
Great product for hotel nerds like myself. Fun to look up random hotels around the globe and read the commentary. The revamped pictures section is a huge help!
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
I have used TripAdvisor website for years to help plan getaways and vacations.  
Everything from hotel reviews to suggestions on what to see & do on vacations. 
For example, TripAdvisor was great to research my recent vacation to Hong Kong, Thailand, & China. 
The App seems to be right in line with the website. 
The only drawback I'm finding (with the App versus website)...   is in posting reviews - I can't seem to be able to post pics along with the review using the App. 
Maybe I simply haven't figured it out. 
But since all else is a breeze using TripAdvisor - I think while writing a review using the App, when finishing... It should prompt you as to whether you would like to post pics with the review or not.
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
Excellent app to plan trips and get into great hotels for reasonable prices. This also helps you get your airplane tickets as well. Also the hotel reviews on this website are really helpful.
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 4
The design need to be improved

Real time touring information, allways trustful!
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
I've heard about trip advisor but didn't start using it until planning for a big trip abroad. The information is abundant, full of details and recommendations. Love that here is iPhone and iPad apps as well as a robust PC experience. Love this site and recommend to everyone to use while booking a trip. It's helped me make the best choices and provided me with key details that I wouldn't have considered otherwise. Thank you trip advisor!
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
I've been using it for years. Highly rated restaurants are always good! Use it and be part of a great and helpful community!
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
Always gives honest feedback on hotels with customer feedback included! Love it!
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 4
Works well...  Love trip advisor in any form and the mobile app keeps getting better and better.

Small niggles:
- Wish finding a hotel or business was a bit easier. The title cuts off and you often click on the wrong one
- wish you could get to settings from any screen... Have to go all the way back to home
Version 8.3 2014-01-01 5
Does everything. New app for me; very happy with it. Just playing around and found a $333.00 flight back home I'm going to book!!!

TA is a REALLY useful group review site for hotels and activities in an area. It helped us a lot when we were stuck without a hotel late at night.

My request for improvement is for the App functionality. There's lack of access (as far as I can see) to your own reviews and image uploads.
Version 8.3 2013-12-31 5
You will find the best attractions and best places :).

I live by TripAdvisor. Don't leave home without it.
Version 8.3 2013-12-31 5
Although it's rightfully named TripAdvisor, this app is invaluable when it comes to planning the best consumer experience in ANY location; even in your local neighborhood. The compilation of reviews, ratings and photos serve to give a great understanding of what you can look forward to. Whether it's dining-out, going to the movies or just staying at a hotel; TripAdvisor can help plan your next consumer experience.
Version 8.3 2013-12-31 5
Look deep at this app, you would really find that TripAdvisor has done a great job on maintaining their app just amazing like the website. Read the positive reviews and you might find what your are looking for, that doesn't mean I ignore the non positive one. But I'm sure all the positive reviews were written for a perfect reason. Thank you TripAdvisor you are what I'm looking for to put my heart and mind in ease where ever I travel and I go.
Version 8.3 2013-12-25 2
The content is great. But it reacts slow when I'm trying to search some places. And it's very inconvenient to go back to the home page

Search function not working properly. Shows only a few, apparently random restaurants in area (Rome) no matter what I try. Frustrating. Have gone back to TA using Safari.
Version 8.3 2013-12-25 4
I always check trip advisor before I try a new restaurant. One of my fav apps. I'd give it 5stars if it was more accurate as far as navigation goes in a big city. Got lost trying to find specific restaurants when I used it in NYC, but then again, it could've been my own err.

I have used this app to travel around Texas and Louisiana. I have found excellent places to eat, stay and visit. Also it has caused managers to address problems I've identified. I will continue to use this app for planning purposes, assuming they maintain the high quality, the remainder of my traveling days.
Version 8.3 2013-12-23 1
We arrived at dollar with a 2 pm reservation plus the rapid service I signed up for last week. It's now been over an hour in line. The placed is mobed with hundreds of customers in line yet very very few counters open. It's about 40% running. There is no where to sit and crying babies and disappointed families in every corner. Food is on the floor and the place is complete disarray. I will never rent of the dump again. I would rather walk. Actually if I had walked to Pasadena I would be almost there. Plus the staff are rude and ignorant. No compassion for the customers standing in this never ending line rather than be with their families for Xmas. My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mom. She has a whole dinner planned tonight. Unfortunately we will be here at dollar waiting for our pre reserved rental car. Rush hour starts in 30 minutes, that will end any chance of seeing my family tonight. Shame on dollar for not properly staffing their rental car center during the important holiday season.
Version 8.3 2013-12-23 2
Now awful since recent update. I can't login to submit reviews!? Near me now isn't accurate.
Version 8.3 2013-12-23 4
I use this app to check out hotel reviews and pics - checking out forums is a bit clunky though.  When hitting the "back" button it always takes you back to the beginning...making the process longer than it needs to be.

Loving this app! Easy and convenient. A real gem if you are a TripAdvisor contributor. The best way to let others know about your experiences at hotels, restaurants, attractions, etc. Just sign in a start reviewing, what could be easier.
Version 8.3 2013-12-23 5
It is useful and easy to use! It is very reliable too. Loving it
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
I use it to look for places near me- in the US and in Europe. It's never failed me! It's the ultimate in honest - the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 4
Always there for me when I'm deciding where to eat or if I need a hotel wherever I may be roaming. My favorite place to add and read reviews.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
Nice app.  Very useful while traveling.
Version 8.2 2013-12-22 4
Great for all aspects of the trip. Has map and list view, which is good.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
It's like having a pocket full of travel agents. Full of great local information and tips for the traveller.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
Enjoy! Tripadvisor is a great website and they delivered with a solid mobile app.

Beautiful app , that help you to choose based in your preference ...a lot of details...I really like it....
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
Using it often, recommendation is good, but find really worthy place is difficult through it.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
If in mood for some very fine Cuban food -$
& great ambiance , visit El Ambia's on Melbourne Ave in Melbourne Fl. Billy makes the best mojitos.   Excellent pork and really nice Cuban music featuring the owner singing on weekends.

Excellent
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 4
Love this app
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
I have used this on PC before I found the app. Use it for hotels mostly, but use it occasionally for restaurants. Reviews very useful. Don't leave home without it.
Version 8.3 2013-12-22 5
Very helpful app!!!!
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
My wife and I are traveling around the US in our RV on a year long honeymoon (we wish you could too).  We have really random, sometimes bizarre interests and Trip Advisor has really helped us pinpoint the cool things in our locations that even the locals verify as favorites.  That's not been the case so much with other aps which, through our experience, seem
to be more for the people who'd rather be seen trying to have fun than actually having fun.   The ap for iPhone is really easy to use and the reviews are informative and entertaining.  This is one of our favorites in our road-trip toolbox.
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
User friendly and usually right about the places.
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
Helpful since I travel and dine out often. This app is super easy to use!
Version 8.2 2013-12-21 5
Fabulous! Accurate and fair reviews.
Version 8.2 2013-12-21 5
Organized, thorough, current.

The best app to avoid having a bad travel experience. The real photos are very helpfull !
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
I really love
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
We're travelling the States so we are in a new town every few days. We rely on Trip Advisor to make recommendations for restaurants and activities. It hasn't disappointed us yet! In return, we leave feedback on places we visit too to build on what's already offered. 
Fabulous app. Literally couldn't do without it!
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 4
The one stop shop for all your touring needs. Go on paid tours only if you want to stay in good hotels - for everything else there's tripadvisor.
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 5
I've been to many places and I trust the ratings in the app above everything. It does really take you to the best (and near you) spots everywhere.
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 2
This app was AWSOME the first day all the other days after that it wouldn't open I would use this so much if it worked. I deleted it and I'm going try and re down load it hope that works
Version 8.3 2013-12-21 2
I'm a big fan of TA. I also like to see pictures of places before going there in addition to reading reviews.

Seems like TA is not really making a lot of efforts to clean up pictures before they're posted. Many are upside down or sideways.

Not good!
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
Simply put, TripAdvisor is THE GO TO APP for searching what you MUST DO IN ANY TOWN INCLUDING YOURS!!!
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
Very nice app for check restaurant hotel and more, very attentive !!!!
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
Its a "must have" app for any traveler, just full of useful info, that also provides local commentary. Well done!
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
Travelers best friend
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
this really is a very good app for the ipad.  one thing that annoys me is that the website is so well laid out and easy to navigate but the app takes a little learning to try and figure out where things are.  its not as obvious as on the website.  a little user point of view engineering would be great.  it really is a useful and well functioning app though.

i am a senior contributor and i love reading the reviews of others also.  trip advisor has proved to be a reliable source of information for me.
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
My first source before I travel for business or pleasure.
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
The food was fresh and tasty.  We loved the vegan chicken bites. The service was great - fast and friendly
Version 8.3 2013-12-20 5
Found this app to very useful for finding restaurants and lodging while traveling and at home. Also found great hidden treasures and places to avoid.
Version 8.2 2013-12-19 5
I use this app so often, both reading other reviews and adding my own. 
It's a great source of information.
Version 8.3 2013-12-19 5
It's a great way to find a new food place even if you have lived there forever, I guarantee this app will find something new for you to try or see. 
I like that you can post photos.
Version 8.3 2013-12-19 1
Ever since the latest update it hasn't worked the same, especially for flight info. I used to be able to find a flight with different airlines very easy and now the only airline it gives me is American. I even tried to filter and add the airlines but it doesn't even pull them up. I've deleted this since it doesn't fulfill my needs any longer.
Version 8.2 2013-12-19 5
My uses are primarily for restaurants & attractions, paying attention to reviews written n recent months. Reviews from veteran travelers and review writers are very helpful.
Version 8.3 2013-12-19 5
Great idea

Flip flapping all over the place! Your app s...! Can't stand it! Y'all update too much, when u got not a thing going good at the moment. Be real with your site, man! Designer of your site, s...!
Version 8.3 2013-12-19 5
I am such a huge fan of TripAdvisor. I use it every time I go out of town. Always able find something to do, somewhere to stay and some place to eat. Never disappoints.
Version 8.2 2013-12-19 4
Always one of the tools I use when researching places to visit.
Version 8.2 2013-12-18 5
Love this app. Don't plan a trip without it!!!
Version 8.2 2013-12-18 5
Use it every time I plan a trip.  Best part is the reviews are accurate and you know what you're getting for what you're paying.
Version 8.2 2013-12-18 5
I like it and I like reviewing things and reading them so it's cool

Terrible upgrade.   App no longer works.
Version 8.2 2013-12-18 4
Lots of features.  Able to search places while on the road.
Version 8.2 2013-12-17 5
This is the best app with the most reviews.   Don't rely on the outlier reviews like the really bad ones or the over-the-top ones that are short. The most informative reviews are the ones that give specific details of the stay.
Version 8.2 2013-12-17 5
I use this app from beginning to end when planning a trip or going out of town for business.  So convenient and easy to use.  Love the rating system!
Version 8.2 2013-12-17 5

Good App but not always accurate when searching. The website is better but the App is the best way to search when travelling.
Version 8.2 2013-12-17 5
I use this app a lot to write reviews, they need to have the option to add pictures from your mobile device. Other than that it's very reliable!
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 1
This app was almost perfect. The mapping was a little klunky so when it said the update made that better I upgraded. There is no more sorting by price so I will stop using this app and slow down on my reviews for TripAdvisor. This is a rare misstep for them.
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 5
Simple as that. There's not much to say because that's all I need in a travel app like this. Very transparent as well!
Version 8.2 2013-12-16 3
It's easy to pull up nearby restaurants and hotels, or by city, and easy to write reviews. 
I find that reviewers are generally too generous with their ratings and comments. Maybe I'm more critical. 
It's difficult to figure out the order in which places are listed:  is it by distance?, rating?, price?  I'd like to be able to sort by rating, in most cases. 
All that being said, I've been using it constantly on our recent trip.

Ai Fiori - we've dined in some of the greatest restaurants in Istanbul, Paris, San Francisco, NYC and Charleston. And Ai Fiori is hands down the best dining experience we've ever had. The food, the service, the attention to details- the best. If you are in NYC do yourself a favor and go.

This is a great app. It is very helpful if you 're in an unfamiliar place. Love the reviews other travelers give. You can find different venues in almost any city.
Version 8.2 2013-12-07 5
If you are like us and love to travel but miss the comforts of home ...we have found the very best hotel.... The DC Ritz Carlton brings new meaning to the word HOSPITALITY!  We were pampered and cared for the entire stay!  The room was so special but always comfortable and immaculate. The staff was always attentive and so helpful!  The West End Bistro was amazing. Even if you are just in DC for the day treat yourself to this Piece of heaven!  They have an amazing menu and their appetizers and cocktails are the best we've had anywhere! This General Manager got it all right with an attention to detail and commitment to each guest to provide the best service and experience that will keep us coming back.  Can't wait to return!
Version 8.2 2013-12-07 5

Version 8.2 2013-12-06 2
I love their website, but the app is lacking some ability to control. Where is the list of my reviews and why can't I edit them on here? What about all the other options that we can check online when submitting a review? Could be so much better.
Version 8.2 2013-12-06 5
This app is pretty good, but it could use the info like Overview, Weather & When to go info, etc. I would like to see that info because it would be like the website.
Version 8.2 2013-12-06 5
I use it as much for planning and having the perfect trip as I do for reviews on things close to home. My 73 year old mom loves it too!
Version 8.1.1 2013-12-06 5
I am a huge fan of trip advisor. I have been pleased with the advice - although you should toss out the outrageously good and bad.  I have been using the new iPad app today &amp; have found it to be very robust. The pictures on the iPad are quite good.
Version 8.2 2013-12-06 5
Love this app. Always find where to go when you travel. With many people on it, it's great to find local places to eat & visit while you are away.

Version 8.2 2013-12-05 5
Have had for several months now. No crashes, no locking up. Shows me what I need to see.
Version 8.2 2013-12-05 3
For hotels, how come you can't sort by distance or price anymore?  "Sort" and "Filter" features are exactly the same when they should be different functions.  For instance, you should be able to filter out hotels that don't have a swimming pool, and then sort them by distance to the city center. Was a really helpful feature in past versions and, without these functions, makes the app much less useful for planning purposes.
Version 8.2 2013-12-05 5
I love using this app when I'm traveling. Especially when they're deals combined. Keep up the good work.
Version 8.2 2013-12-05 4

I always check Trip Advisor before I consider hotels, attractions, restaurants. It's invaluable and a great resource. Can't go wrong with it.

Love this app
Version 8.2 2013-12-04 2
Have been a long time pleased user of the app.
However, the latest update caused concern. Selecting a 5 star hotel's "pricing" sent me instead to photos of rooms and bathrooms. Selecting "hotel website" resulted in a map display. Good grief.
Version 8.2 2013-12-04 5
My go to app for finding restaurants and cool hotels while traveling.  Usually right on the money.  Needs better category for nightlife, bars, beer/liquor stores tho, to help us craft beer hunters out there.

Rubbish.

I hate this app, you can not even submit reviews (broken) with it. Rather get Foursquare or Yelp as the information is old and outdated.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-27 5

We adore this hotel! Only 7 rooms, price is right, wonderful staff and ambiance. Converted immense home right in the Old City of Cartegena. This place used to be a party location for US celebrities (sp?) back in the day and we understand why. This is now our ONLY destination hotel in Cartegena. If you can afford $275 a night, you will never regret staying here! Viva Colombia;)
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-26 5
Trip adviser is an awesome app! Any vacation I'm about to plan I check Trip advisor first before booking. You get a lot of great info from other people who have experienced it first hand.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-26 5
Tripadvisor is a great app/website that provides excellent,common sense, critical information for the traveller no matter where you go. Conditions of the facility/restaurant, cost, service provided by the staff, and more, are at your fingertips. Feedback is provided by actual travelers so you are provided with honest results. A definite place to check when you aren't sure!

I explored on all travel sites available while planning for a trip to Puerto Rico lately. Ended up getting the most valuable informations from tripadvisor on where to go, where to stay and where to dine. Everybody in my small travel group is happy. Would definitely recommend this site to friends.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-25 2
This used to be a very user friendly app, but now it is just frustrating.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-25 5
Ive tried several of these types of apps and this is my fave. So far every hotel and restaurant that we reviewed as a too fave on their site became our new fave.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-25 5
Must use!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-25 5
Wouldn't travel without it.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-24 5
Well ladies, I am certain that if your mate is anything like mine......I always end up making ALL of the decisions about where to go, what to do & where to eat!!  I have been using TA  for 6 or 7 years and can count our lousy experiences on less than one hand.....so, needless to say.....I still have my job as "recreational advisor" in our family!!  Thank you Trip Advisor for making me look so good!!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-24 5
Trip advisor has not steered me wrong on any of my trips.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-24 5
Very reliable. Fav app. Must have for travelers.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-24 5
We have started using trip advisor to find places to eat everytime we take a trip. Makes finding great food in new places a snap.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-24 5
GREAAAAAAAAAAAT
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 1
Maybe I'm biased b/c I just spent 20 min on a review only to lose the whole thing b/c the app decided I wasn't logged in. 

Overall I have a very hard time getting this app to do anything useful.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 5
Have used this app for several years, rarely dies it steer you wrong on restaurants, motels or attractions! Easy to look up about anything for a quick look at many opinions.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 5
Genco is an old world Italian restaurant, the sandwiches are the best in town. When you walk in you feel like you are being greeted by family, and the soup tastes every bit as good as grandmas soup. That is because everything at GENCO'S is homemade with love! A Must have is the wedding soup. I went in and had a small bowl, I was so sorry I didn't get some to bring home. 
I live in Boca Raton, and I drive to Fort Lauderdale just for one of there great sandwiches. All are excellent, hard to recommend on over the other. So keep going in and decide for yourselves!!!

Address for Genco is
257-B Commercial Blvd, Lauderdale By the Sea.

Also in case you are wondering I am not related in any way!Just love this place :)
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 1
It has been a couple years and still VERY unfriendly to find your location again after initial search. So finding restaurants near you hard. Hate this enough to majorly ding it.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 1
The app has always been inferior to the website, but now they seem to be trying to push you to make a reservation just to search.  This is new and very annoying.  You can work around the challenges but overall the app has gotten more prone to send you to a screen you can't get back from.  Trip advisor has been my "go to" sight for years and have seen competitors go away.  The silver lining  is this bad app design and pushing the users where they don't want  to go creates an opportunity for another site to gain a foothold and maybe a new leader by treating users better.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 5
The interface is nice and easy to use, loading speeds are very fast, and it has everything you would need for what you're looking for. I reccomend this app
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 5
I've been using advisor for years, and apparently I just now getting around to giving it a review. 

Such a huge diversity of focus areas like restaurants, hotels, and attractions along with a huge user base which increases the value of the app exponentially.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 3
I love love love the website and think their service is tremendously valuable. I am also a constant contributor. But why on earth have your app ask you to contribute to Facebook on your behalf? In this day and age there is a way to have Facebook integration - a balance of access and rights - that gives a company what they need without asking so much from your customers.  That is just too much an shows their approach is either outdated or misinformed.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-23 5
Fast and accurate. Real nice app.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
Trip advisor is full of the best trip app available. If you're traveling without it, you are not traveling right. Grab this app and enjoy ann the hidden gems each city has to offer.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
Love using the app. to scout out a city before visiting. Very useful to use while in and around your destination.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
Used this app on my last vacation made driving around looking for places to eat a thing of the past
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 2
Please please do not put a back "home" button at the top where people are used to hitting back. No one is used to hitting "back" at the bottom of the screen like that! Seriously frustrating having to constantly re navigate to what I was just looking at due to the poor design.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
Would never stay anywhere without referring to TripAdvisor.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
I use this app all the time to research my hotel option.  So far it has work like a charm. Easy to navigate and very efficient.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
This app is one of my favorites anywhere you go you can find something to do and even get linked to purchase options.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
It's. Very good ..love it
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
It's. Very good ..love it
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 1
New version is terrible. Hate the design.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-22 5
Great app broseph
Version 8.0.2 2013-11-21 5
Useful
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-21 5
Somebody-more than likely lots of bodies, thought through this app and man did they do their homework.
Thank you! This is my go to for travel. Flights, hotel, restaurants...
It does it all and makes my life so easy.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-21 4
If you have used TA's app for sometime you know this latest version is finally a great experience. You can now access the entire site and its content on your mobile device. It's groovy for all your travel needs!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-21 3
Great for researching trip to Paris from the states.  But once there, relied on yelp and google maps much more because they were more versatile, reliable and easier to use.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-21 5
App keeps on improving, I use it all the time, helpfull!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
Tremendously helpful in planning a
trip to many interesting parts of the world!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
Never make a reservation without checking TA. Always check reviews on restaurants, hotels, resorts, or attractions. Never worry about the results as the members tell the truth. There are differences of taste and level of service expected but you can read a few reviews and get a feel for what to expect.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
I love this app, works in all my favorite cities. And the huge selection of restaurants is amazing!!!
Trial and error in trying those places is fun!!!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 1
I gave up on this app a year ago. Decided to try it again, after seeing ratings go up.

Guess what? Still so-o-o much worse than web site:
- can't sign in with my Trip Advisor account - sign in field disappears once you start typing
- can't filter search results by price
- missing lots of hotels - right around me! - that are clearly shown on web site
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 3
Very useful and convenient
Version 8.1 2013-11-20 4
The app is limited on functionality
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
This app is awesome for traveling and finding great places to eat, or things to do when you're someplace unfamiliar. And the 'Near You Now' function is wonderful too! We've used it several times while traveling and it has saved us a bunch of time and money and prevented us from falling into the tourist  traps for meals and activities.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
Com certeza um dos melhores aplicativos/sites de dicas de viagens!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-20 5
Love it!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 4
What happened to showing restaurants near the hotels you are looking at??  That part was so nice when planning a trip and wanting to stay close to where we are staying.  Please bring that part back!!!!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 1
I've tried three times to get flight information, and three times the website reverted to the hotel search default! I see no reason to continue to use TripAdvisor. It gets one star because the review process doesn't provide for negative ratings!
Flight Frustrated
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 5
Fantastic!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 5
Very good app!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 2
An option to find hotels near an airport is essential (and missing). In big cities, I want to stay near the airport, and this app does not help. Hotels could be an hour's cab drive away, and there's no way of knowing.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 5
Easy to use app; very resourceful.  Amazingly accept bad reviews of places which is especially helpful.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 5
I liked very much.. Is easy an fast..
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-19 3
I used to use the app quite a bit when traveling and planning trips. The latest versions have a problem sorting my saves. I'll try it by location and then by type (hotel) and it simply won't sort. Please fix this annoying bug to what used to be a better app.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
I use app while traveling and find it very useful:
1. For selecting a good hotel, alternative accommodations, or  rentals. 2. to learn about key attractions in cities, parks and monument areas. 3. Restaurant rating and review are reliable. 
Great to use app in combo with Yelp for selection fine tuning too in USA. 
Find very useful internationally when yelp isn't available. Also use the trip adviser city app.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 4
I use the app mostly for researching hotel options and things to do in different towns around the world. Works well for this. The reviews are very valuable.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Great , simple , resourceful !
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 4
I have written reviews regularly, but it now tells me that I cannot re-review a restaurant within a month. However, my reviews were written a year ago. They seem not to be able to recognize the year of review. However, when they do get it right, the app is useful with useful reviews.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Nice app. It looks good and it runs smooth
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Love this app. So easy to use and full of good travel info. It's my first "go to" travel app.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Now that I have the ability to review places right on my iPhone, I use my tripadvisor much more. And I'm very satisfied.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
I use my trip advisor app all the time. It's very useful for finding my destination and allows for easy review entry for me as well.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Very helpful for me! Love the reviews for helping me find places when I don't have a guide book with me
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 4
I'm loving it so far
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Encuentras los sitios dond quieras ir a pasar buen rato
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Such a handy app no matter where you are traveling!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 2
The new app seems to be based on html5. While it's functional but it loads very slow and looks ugly.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
trip advisor has the best mobile app for those on the road! easy to navigate
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
Great app. Always check it out before any trip
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-18 5
The handiest app alive
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
Spend some time planning a trip with this app and you will know where you are and what to do when you get there.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 1
You can no longer move the map around and get new results in that new location. That was literally the only way I used the app, which made it awesome. With that now missing, I hate it.  5 star app down to 1 star in a single update. Really a shame, I hope this gets fixed.

Update: great that the map issue is now fixed.  Have the feeling it is very poorly programmed, very choppy and buggy.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
Easy to use, great app.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
Working in Waikiki reviews are very important. And trip advisor is the biggest supporter!!! Must have if you travel or even if you just want to check on your hotel.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 4
Some places that had menus on the old version are missing them on the new one. Other than that the app is extremely helpful and easy to use.  Much improved navigation.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 4
Cool app with a lot of helpful info for when you are traveling.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
Works fine, no complaints here
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
Very helpfull

Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
great for researching trips or looking for a place to eat when traveling, also a great place to find some helpful advice.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-17 5
I can easily write reviews, upload pictures, and search for restaurants.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 3
Recent updates have improved the app but, still can't sort reviews based on ratings. I hate having to scroll through all the reviews just to try to find the bad ones. Please, please allow sorting of reviews again. Was available in previous versions, but no more.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 5
Love Trip Advisor and this app brings it with me wherever I go!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 5
I don't go anywhere without checking my tripadvisor ratings and see how other people enjoyed shops, attractions, Restaraunts.
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 3
This app is useful, but not as functional as it could be. I find it's setup for navigating forums counterintuitive - the forums are one of the best tools tripadvisor has!
If you travel a lot, its worth having this app, but i hope they continue to work to make it better and more easily navigatable!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 4
Tripadvisor is like having a local guide with you
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 5
A must have!
Version 8.1.1 2013-11-16 5
It's been great having this in my pocket. Have used it for finding hotels, getting travel tips , even just locating a restaurant near by. It's always a great tool to have in your pocket as a modern traveller.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
It does what it says, nice thing about it is that it compares prices between other companies and usually saves you the time. Great to read comments from others that will help you when visiting a place!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 3
The latest version of this iPad app still does not feel smooth surfing through it.  I find myself hitting links repeatedly to go where I want to.  When I am researching restaurants, there is no convenient way to return to the main list.  This app could be very useful if only the developers took the time to make it work right, and work better.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
I love this app! I find it very helpful to locate quality businesses to patronize when I'm out of town. Reading reviews definitely helps me make decisions, and I haven't been let down yet!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Best info on hotels hands down!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
I use tripadvisor constantly, even for local dining and attractions. I have found the reviews here especially helpful.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Information is easily accessible and the ratings and reviews give confidence when booking new adventures.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Really great app
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 2
I love the actual tripadvisor website and never choose a hotel without checking TA first. That said, I hate the app now. I like it before the OS7 changes. Now I hate it. Wish I could undo the so called upgrade.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Cant travel without it.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Keeps the page open to forums or other pages u were reading.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 1
This app does not maintain state when you switch to another app and back. This is lunacy. After searching through the app, if you switch to, say, Chrome/Safari/etc. as part of your research then switch back, THE APP GOES BACK TO THE MAIN SEARCH SCREEN and not your last page. FAIL.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Works well
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Excellent app!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 3
Wish I didn't upgrade.  The older version was much more user friendly - easier to navigate and find what you want.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-31 5
Gave me the ability to have 2 wonderful vacations!! Thank you TripAdvisor
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 1
upgrades to 8.0.2 on 10/23 and it won't load.  I get the splash screen for about 3-4 seconds and then it goes back to the app select screen. Worse than useless
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
This app helps me avoid terrible restaurants when I travel.  So far, no surprises. Thank you!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
Makes it easy to find nearby options when plans change. Good up to date information. Great for world travelers! Highly recommended!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 4
I recently got into Trip Advisor during a trip to Chile. The app helped me out a lot. After a few experiences I started leaving reviews of my own that I felt would be helpful to others. Now I have even added new establishments to Trip Advisor! Overall a good app for on the go recommendations.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
This is my go-to app when on the road for business or pleasure. Great functionality with a huge amount of user-derived content make this a must-have app for anyone who travels frequently! How did we manage before TA?
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 3
The app won't let me login with Facebook. You can't view your profile. I go to the website, either on my phone or CPU.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
Very informative and useful. I use it very frequently.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
Can't say how much of a help this app has been,booking over seas trip & tripadvisor really takes the guess work out of the uncertainty. I won't check in unless if checked it out on tripadvisor. Very nice
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
Very useful tool for travelers. A definite must have on my list!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-30 5
Very happy with app, highly recommend
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-29 4
Good for Hotels, not as good for rating restaurants. Too many high scores for average restaurants, but very good for hotels and resorts
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-29 5
Great feature
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-29 5
I user this site for all my travel needs.    Check out the forums to interact with others making your same trip!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-29 5
Excellent app,
iPad version pictures are a problem though to
View
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-29 4
Great app -- but it won't stop asking for a review. Annoying. Stop that and I'll upgrade to 5 stars.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-29 4
Love it! Use it all the time.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
Use it everywhere I go. Easy and helpful!  Facilitates efficiency for sure!
Version 7.1.1 2013-10-28 3
Just okay. Slow service and average food. Potato leek soup was good
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
Tripadvisor is a world-changing website/app. What an amazing idea bringing the world together to provide reviews on places to go and things to see. I use tripadvisor any time I book a trip and also every time I return home. This is one app I am truly thankful for!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 1
Initial green screen appears, then closes and that's it. Tried deleting reinstalling, turning phone off, reinstalling.  No helpful info or help on App Store page or on Tripadvisor web page. Used main website via browser while traveling this weekend, but not as travel/iphone friendly.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 1
Latest version crashes on launch on my iPhone 4, iOS 5. Please fix.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 4
Works great, simple connection to FB
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
Great compliment to the website, always use tripadvisor before deciding on a hotel. The app is great for reviews, however, the photo usability can be a bit of a pain.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 1
Latest version removed functionality that made this app indispensable.  Used to be able to search hotels purely by scrolling the map and having it update the hotel selection automatically.  Not so any more... Frustrating and disappointing.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 1
Really need to know how far a restaurant is from my current location so that I don't hAve to take a cab from hotel or fight traffics. Would like to know what's near me.  

Too bad it has the makings of a great app!!!

Back to yelp
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
I've used this app more times than I can count and have chosen hotels & restaurants based on all reviews good & not so.  I recommend this site and app to all.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
I love using the TA App whenever we travel.  The information on dining and lodging us a great help and the unbiased reviews are welcomed.  I find that I rely on TA quite often.  The info provided is usually right on.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
I can navigate through this app very easily and I really am enjoying the way I can just post reviews. Thank you TripAdvisor!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
Love this app!!!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 4
Easy to use but the face of the app And the app is boring.  But work well though
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 5
I have been using this app for a while now. It has been extremely helpful and I have enjoyed writing as well reading reviews.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 2
Disappointed I cannot customize my search choices as much as I can on Yelp. E.g. no brew pubs - only Cuisines.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-28 3
This app is seemingly become 'more basic' as time has passed. You used to be able to look at "traveler tips" from the reviews and choose whether you wanted to view photos submitted by travelers OR hotel management. No longer...unless I'm severely missing something. It still gets the job down though, but gets downgraded from a 5 star to a 3 star for me.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-27 5
Has all the info I want.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-27 5
Our travels now are rarely disappointing because we follow people who have similar taste & service expectations!!

Love love love it!!!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 1
That's the best part of tripadvisor. Lame. Time for an app upgrade.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
Use it all the time. Great site and app.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 2
You can't scroll very well when your trying to find a hotel, there's no search function that would find the hotel I was staying at and the attractions around and close by. When scrolling  the hotels you would get to the bottom but it would let go on the the next 20 until you tap on a hotel then you could scroll down to the next 20. It has some good photos of every thing when you find it it doesn't perform  well on my iPad it's slow and it hard find what information your looking for if I was to use to book a hotel it might be worth it
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 2
Very welcomed integration with google maps app. What it is missing now, removed from previous versions is filtering capabilities by distance and ranking (simultaneously). I usually what to find the best options around me, not the fast food joints. So either by stars or by ranking I want to restrict restaurants within a distance. Current filter by price or type is useless to me (let's be honest, price indications are nothing to be trusted). Better filtering capabilities and It would become a 5 star app.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 1
I used to love this app until it stopped working on my iPhone 3GS. The app information doesn't say anything about what iOS version it works with either. I deleted it. Just lost me as a user!!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 4
I use this app when traveling. Found some diamonds in the rough when visiting new places. Love to rate where we go also.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 4
I like the app, it's easy and fun to use, but not all attractions always show up...but it does not glitch and the updates only make it better, so it's pretty cool
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 1
Couldn't find listing for a place that badly needs a review. So there seems to be no way to write a review.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 1
Why can't I filter restaurants by cuisine anymore? I hate it. Switching to another app.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
One of the best life resources you'll ever have
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
Great application when traveling or just plain gathering information!
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
I don't book any travel without checking this app.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 5
I use trip advisor for every trip.  It has always been honest and reliable when planning.  Love the new save feature on the map itself.  This has helped with an upcoming trip.

I have been using this app for a couple years, with iOS7 it is NOT that good. You can't look at menus for restaurants, the directions do not work as good. 
I have found amazing restaurants and B&Bs, but with the latest version I do not rely on it. Hopefully they will make it more useful. Can't wait until it gets better.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-26 1
Trip Advisor is a useful resource but they have made the ipad app very challenging. I wonder if the developers have actually used the app to plan their travels. 

Only 20 hotels are shown at a time. For cities like New York, that is simply a poor experience.  Recommendation for developers: use scrolling. 

Map view only shows you a map of the 20 hotels whose page you are on. It needs to show all the hotels for the map region that is being viewed.

You can't search within the results of a city. When I am viewing the hotels for a city and tap the search bar, the keyboard pops up, disappears then pops up and disappears again. Quite annoying.

Wrote a review on my iPhone hit submit, it told me to log in which I did. hit submit again and it gave me an error stating that I was missing something and the review couldn't be submitted, then it kicked me back to the page of the place I was trying to review and discarded my review. Guess I'll do it again later from my tablet and make sure I check all the right boxes.

Used to love TripAdvisor, told all my friends about it.. Useless now. No web links to view restaurant menus ?? Why bother ?? How fun is it to see a list of 300 places to eat when you have to Google for a menu?   Hard to find web links to anything... Want to know more about a museum? Be prepared to Google

Version 8.0.1 2013-10-24 4
I love that the Oct 2013 update lets me filter for pet-friendly hotels. BUT (and this applies to every app that lets users compare hotel prices):

1) to make a useful comparison, the user needs not just the base room rate, but parking fees and pet fees. These never seem to be available except at the hotel's own website, and the difference can be HUGE. 

2) booking online is not a practical option if you're traveling with a pet, because none of the apps (including the hotels' own) let you select a pet-friendly room. Unless you've made your reservation by phone with the hotel, you might learn at check-in that the room grade you reserved is off limits for pets... I know TripAdvisor doesn't do direct booking, but it would be great to know whether pets are limited to certain rooms, so we can factor that in when deciding whether to book online. 

3) One easy fix I'd like to see in a future update: display uploaded photos beginning with most recent.

It's a letdown to share a photo and not be able to see it without scrolling through a hundred or so older ones. 

4). I know I said three. Minor glitch: I can no longer select Helpful when reading reviews by other users. 

I haven't found a single booking app that

Never plan a trip without first consulting tripadvisor for hotels, attractions and even private housing options

I use this app to find accommodations and restaurants on all our travels.  It's invaluable to have this wealth of data at my fingertips; making our travel experience all the better as we focus on hotels and restaurants that get great reviews.  I also use this app to write reviews.  I love being able to quickly write a review with my real-time thoughts.
Version 8.0.2 2013-10-24 2
Yes, it was glitchy on the iPad with iOS 7, but still incredibly useful. But with the update to iOS 7.0.3, the app will no longer open! Yesterday I would have rated it 4 stars, so I give 2 in hopes it's fixed ASAP.

Required for the frequent traveler dissatisfied with hotel food. Reviews are on point (generally) without notable histrionics.

Addition of URL's to restaurant sites, especially menus, would aid the utility of the app.

I've stayed in Billings many times and this is one of the better hotels - it shouldn't be this hard to rate something.  Guys I know you can do better than this
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5
This app is definitely the best travel app I have ever used.  It allows me to see what attractions/restaurants are popular and what others are saying about it.  The app even offers web links to attractions if available.  I would definitely recommend this app to my friends!  Thanks trip advisor!  :)
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-19 5

We have been using trip advisor for hotels and restaurants in seven different countries over the last three years and have found its ratings uniformly accurate in our experience. We consider it the same as word of mouth which is how we look for local services in the US.

The newest update seems to only want to link you to book a hotel room. You can't click on the ratings review to skip to just the good-bad-terrible reviews. At one point trip advisor was the only site I trusted to give real reviews. I don't feel the same anymore. It really is sad.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 5
There is so many great things to do I have discovered thanks to this app. Even places close to me. The reviews section is also a great tool because you get feedback and recommendations from people that has already been there.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 1
No websites or menus listed anymore plus when you go to read the reviews you can't just click on a terrible or excellent reviews you have to read them all.  I wish I never updated

Can't see any reason why this is locked in landscape mode. Dumb. Deleted. Fix and will try again.

Update after update...still a piece of crap. No longer sideways, but can't scroll through pictures. Pictures hang, go backwards instead of forward, and repeat same one over again. 

Come on. How hard can it be?
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-17 4
You can rarely go completely wrong using the advise of others but often others have different standards or expectations.  Learning the users tastes  would obviously be the best but even simple demo, recency or type of trip filters would take this service to the next level.

I love trip advisor and I use to love the app. You can't just look at hotels in an area. You have to go through the search process and if that hotel isn't available those dates then it's not on a list. It's just not as user friendly as it use to be and it's really disappointing.

Reviews are great but Tilripadvisor reads them first. They review photos too. I have a negative review and they wouldn't post the photos. Something about the photos not being clear! Bullsh$t!  They were mint and I even had my BF take photos and give them to me.  Ridiculous!  Speaking the truth is a problem for them. I had undercooked chicken and they didn't want to post that I could've been sick. If they prefer to alter reviews then why bother!!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 4
I use this app frequently-glad I found it!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-16 4
I find the App pretty straightforward and seemingly accurate 95% of the time.
I just clicked on "Nearby Attractions" here where I live on Marco Island and was directed to a small island 900 miles away in the Carribean.
It just makes me wonder sometimes about just how the application comes up with something so out of Whack...

By far, The TripAdvisor app and website are both my most used for travel info and advice.  Never book a hotel without looking up reviews and always find best restaurants and attractions nearby while on travel using this app.

I love trip advisor & until today I absolutely loved the app. I used to be able to click on any category of reviews for a hotel without having to read all 300 of them. It is an app - Good, bad & ugly should be easily accessible independently for a snapshot of pros & cons. They have made recent changes to the app which make it impossible to read a category of reviews. No longer quick & easy to access in a snapshot when booking a hotel. If you are going to make changes, make the app more efficient, not less so. Change it back!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 5
Use all the time in USA and recently used on our vacation I Europe. Never let me down.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 5
Once you figure out how to read between the lines of some reviewers material, this is a valuable resource.
I always check here when getting a bargain on a hotel to see if its even worth staying there. Most of the time the reviewers or spot on.
If someplace gets mostly positive responses, it's usually good to go. 
A person is more likely to complain about an issue versus commending an establishment for meeting or exceeding their expectations, so read between the lines.
I use it every time I travel for hotels and attractions, don't leave home without it.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 1
The latest update is terrible! It broke the ability to scroll around the map and have the map/list auto-update what attractions are around where you are looking on the map.

I use this to plan all my trips & it has never failed me!! Love it, especially the new update!!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 4
Update, much of my issues were user confusion with the new UI. The app is still my favorite travel app. Oh BTW I emailed TA with my issues and they reviewed them and responded. So I conclude they care about their app. 

This app has definitely taken a step backwards. It used to come up with your current location and you could just search for something based on your current location. Now you have to put in a location to get any information. The search results also appear more convoluted than they used to be. Fancy graphics and pretty pictures do not cut it.

It also does not allow you to put it in a folder. While I used to like the app and am a 'top contributor' to Trip advisor I will be using Yelp or Around Me until these issues are fixed.

Operation is also very quirky. This app has become a mess.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 5
Tripadvisor is the first and foremost integrated travel application to use for flight, hotel, reviews, and local attractions. Even if you use other travel sites to search prices, Tripadvisor has better user photos and reviews than Kayak, or Travelocity. 

Highly recommended as one of the app needed on your smartphone or tablet.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 1
Used to have a feature that would tell you what is near what you are searching. I am not talking about "near me now." I'm talking about What's nearby. Please bring that back! No one is going to want to stay at a hotel if they can't tell what restaurants are near, etc. Without that this is a useless app.
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 3
Good info, but missing a lot. Hard to change not put new info in.
Version 7.0.1 2013-10-15 4
Very helpful. I use it for all my trip planning!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 1
The latest update is missing one of the most useful features: average rates for each hotel listed. I know these are never exact, I always have in mind a general budget for a stay. And there is no way to filter for, say, 3 star hotels. The only choice is 3 stars and up--so I have to wade through overpriced luxury hotels I don't want. Now I have to go to a booking site or the hotel's website to see whether I'd consider a hotel based on rates. This makes a search much too time-consuming. I'm a frequent user and reviewer. Bring back hotel rates, please!
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 1
Unresponsive , crashes every time, takes forever to load, do not update !!! please back to the old one...
Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 1
Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate. Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I am seeing much worse: locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area. Want to golf? Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesn't exist. The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house.

Next problem, related to this is the "Near Me" function. First, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town. When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse. The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house.

Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's a lot less functional than the website.

Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed. I am definitely unhappy with this version.

Version 8.0.1 2013-10-15 2
It's nice that you can look up almost everything you need to in one app, but when it comes to looking up said items, this app is so slow and at time unresponsive. I catch myself EVERY TIME trying to scroll through pictures of hotels and it just won't scroll. The arrows aren't even responsive. And when I press done I have to wait for it to go back to the previous screen if it even does that. Please fix this. It's really annoying.

Version 8.0 2013-10-14 1
I can't figure out if the "full rewrite" is just broken or poor design.  The problems for me are all about the location based interface.  Previously you could scroll the map to the direction you were heading and pick up more restaurants and hotels with the new location.  This was very useful if you are driving or walking and looking for a place to eat or stay along your upcoming route.  This feature seems to be broken or removed.  Also, once you are looking at a description, it seems to be difficult or impossible to back up to where you were on the map.
Version 8.0 2013-10-14 3
App works fine, but I'd like to be able to fully view my account (contributions as an example) on the app. Also, the rating functionality is limited on the app versus the website - the app only allows you to give an overall rating and doesn't break it down further.
Version 8.0 2013-10-13 1
I can't really say how well this app works because I can't sign in to my existing account with TripAdvisor. The screen stays blank when I click on the sign-in icon.
Version 8.0 2013-10-13 3
Unable to login. When I click the option to sign in, I'm taken to a blank white page.
Version 8.0 2013-10-13 2
This app has serious performance and usability issues.  I often end up just going to the website.
Version 8.0 2013-10-08 4
I use TA as my source to find the best restaurants and hotels when I travel. The community contributing to TA is reliable and rather descriptive which helps make decisions. You gotta love travel technology!
Version 8.0 2013-10-08 2
Just got back from a trip in Spain and had numerous problems with this app.  It worked differently on the iPhone versus the iPad.  It kept locking up, which meZn I had to constantly "hard restart" my iPhone 5.
Version 8.0 2013-10-08 4
I've found plenty of useful info with TripAdvisor. They have really stepped up their game, and the new iOS 7 interface is clean and useable.
Version 8.0 2013-10-08 4
Love this app but don't like the changes on the iPhone app....used to be able to filter by top rated & distance but no more; please fix this!!!!!
Version 8.0 2013-10-08 1
The feature I used the most was to zoom in on an area in the map mode and find restaurants and hotels in that area. Can't figure out how to do that now; there is no "refresh" mode after I zoom in on a geographical area now. Please fix!!
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 4
The latest update is smoother and better looking.  But for me, the heart of the app is the near me now section.  It is harder to find, in this version.  But, overall an excellent app still.  I have never gone to a highly rated restaurant, and been disappointed.  Still best in its class...
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 5
this app was the ideal tools to search the area I was in by shrinking the map to the area of interest and finding what I wanted.  Now I must filter through the entire city, which makes this now an unusable app.  Is there a way I can uninstall the upgrade please?
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 5
Love the new look.
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 2
Can't find even the best hotels, submit reviews, previous reviews, etc
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 5
In Madrid, nyc, and hopefully in venice! Many can give you great monuments, but only TA gives you great places to eat!
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 5
The app is fantastic. Easy navigation, easy way of finding the destination for review, overall nice app to have if you are always on the move and need to compare vicinities which to attend.
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 1
This App gets worse with each update!
Version 8.0 2013-10-07 1
TripAdvisor has apparently decided it is not important for people to use the map to do searches for hotels anymore.  They had a great interface in the previous version, but they have seen fit to "simplify" it to the point of uselessness.  Gone is the ability to pan the map and have your search applied to a new area.  Gone are the excellent filters for refining your search.  What are you thinking TripAdvisor? The app is essentially useless for me now!!!
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 4
I trust this site to give me the correct information at all times and have not been disappointed yet.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 4
Every review must be verified through the property in one way or another. These are real reviews by real people who have experienced the service.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 1
This update negates the usefulness of the previous app. It does not know where yo are at any more and does not provide location service. 

In the previous version you could scroll the map and see your desired categories update on screen. This version no longer does that. You have to type in a cityor location. Totally useless when yo are traveling
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 2
There are no links to original websites for hotels.  I really hate being locked into one vendor's version of truth (and lack of details).  Please add links (or make them more obvious if I overlooked them) to original websites for all items since your app can't possibly include everything the original site can provide.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 2
Used to be a great app. With the removal of the "restaurants near me" feature I no longer can use it.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 5
This is an amazing app that has been updated to show maps of attractions now. This is a must for any serious explorer.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 1
Looks like the new version of the app doesn't have anymore map view for things to do. It was the most useful feature for me for planning little trips around me. The map that when moved updated recommendations with things to do is now missing.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 1
There's an old saying that goes like this."If it ain't broke don't fix it" 

Well Trip Advisor took a great app and ruined it. The map view was easier to navigate in the old version. There was more information on the screen than this new version. Bring back the old version.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 5
Always reliable and usually very acurate about the places to visit. The only issue is that some people will try to ruin the reputation of some hotels or restaurants because of one mistake.
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 5
Good app to have
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 5
Great mobile version for this great site!
Version 8.0 2013-10-06 3
Either it's hard to find or the ipad version doesn't have it, but I cannot figure out how search for restaurants near me - something I can do on my iphone.   That's a pretty serious omission!  
I like tripadvisor over yelp especially outside the US, but now it's a PITA to find a place to eat dinner if I'm not planning big time ahead ....
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 1
I rarely update apps at least for a few weeks to read the reviews on what the update does.  90% of the time it adds an ad window or takes away some function.  Tripadvisor is a shell of what it was before this update.  was my top 5 app on the planet.  Google does much better local searches for food and places to stay now.
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 5
I love it and use it every time I plan a trip
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 5
It's new and improved and so smooth to use, highly recommend If you like traveling! 5 stars!
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 5
Use it always when traveling!!
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 1
New update doesn't let you click on ratings. When you click on poor, for example, it opens all reviews. Please fix!!
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 1
The app used to be tolerable, but after just updating to the latest version, I clicked to view some forums and there is NO way to get out of them and back to the main app.  Even closing the app doesn't work as it just re-opens in the same dead end.  Obviously this wasn't well tested before being released!
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 2
What happened to the near me now function? It disappeared after upgrading to iOS7 for iPad2.
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 2
With the latest update you can not sort through the different reviews for a place or restaurant. Before you could click 'terrible' or 'average' and read only the reviews giving this rating for a particular place.
I like being able to jump to the bad reviews to know what I might have in store for me. 
Please fix this!
Version 8.0 2013-10-05 2
The feature I used most in the previous version was "Near me know" to find restaurants on the interactive map. This feature has been removed in the latest version. I wish I had never updated this app.
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 1
The map view does not work and the "near me" function dissapered. There is not an effective way to use this app.
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 5
Great app. Much easier to use. Good design and love the City Map integration!
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 1
The new update won't allow me to sign in. The screen just comes up blank when I click sign in. I don't want to sign in through Facebook. Help correct this please!
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 4
I have been using this app and it is awesome. But after the yesterday update, something is gone wrong. Can u plz fix the bug asap.
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 1
I try looking for flights and it brings me to a blank page.
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 2
The content is useful and the new design is nice but still feels slow and unresponsive compared to other travel iOS apps. I had higher expectations for this new version. Please make it a native app!
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 2
This version look hard hope they updated another one soon I do like tripadvisor it's nice
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 1
My Forums page is now blank. Please, please, please fix!!!
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 2
The new (complete rewrite) version is a disappointment.  Very slow to no response to photo paging requests, lack of hotel search facility for a given city and incomplete searches for hotels.  These are just a few problems I noted on first use of rewritten app.  Needs some work.  Hopefully there will be an update released soon.  This used to be a great app.
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 5
The redesign of the app is perfect! Keep up the good work.
Version 8.0 2013-10-04 1
The new app for the iOS 7 is absolutely worthless now. You have no way to search for a place to have a nice dinner near a hotel or find things to do near your stay. Again worthless. This was our whole purpose for using this app. Need to fix this and put it back the way it was. Will not be using this until it's fixed. It used to be our go to travel app now it's crap.
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 2
Needs some work. Can't drill down to a restaurant location then easily return to list
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 3
Updated and my saves are gone.
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 1
The former app was so user friendly and laid out well for navigation.  The update, October 3, is more cumbersome, harder to get back to home screen, has no "back screen" button that I've found.  Map isn't even as easy to see and read.  Am so tired of companies "updating" their apps just for the sake of updates!
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 5
A functional and stylish update to one of the best travel tools around.
Version 8.0 2013-10-03 5
Great German food!
Fresh Schnitzel - Burger was my delight!
Danke !
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-16 2
First things first: search for nearby restaurants, select one, view it on the map, go back, and back again: now the restaurants are sorted by rating and not distance.

Secondly it's got pretty bad data on nearby restaurants in the Metaxourgous area in Athens.

Generally speaking it's laggy.

Doesn't work offline which would be awfully handy for a travel app. At least remembering my starred choices would be great.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-16 4
What more can I say, reasonable priced and clean.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-15 1
Classified Chinese restaurants as French.  Ridiculous.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-15 5
We use this often and appreciate others who take time to rate places and food.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-15 4
Consistently use trip advisor for all of my trips everywhere I go.  Wouldn't go without the app or the city guides.  Taking a star away because it keeps asking me to rate the app!   Annoying!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-15 5
I really find this app useful when planning activities for a trip to a new location!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-15 5
I love eating at the Manhattan Deli every time we come to Atlantis Casino in Reno.  They give you a lot of food for such a great price. Staff is always friendly.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-14 1
Horribly written app from pretty much every perspective imaginable.  Slow, buggy, and badly designed user experience. Most basic of user operations only lead to frustration. For example, on the iphone version if you've requested a list of nearby restaurants and then selected a restaurant from the list, when you return to the result list it will have changed to be every restaurant sorted by popularity, forcing you to completely start over from the home screen to get you original distance sorted results back. This is probably the most common operation in the app, so for it not work shows how little thought went into the design and implementation of this app. It's a shame because Tripadvisor has lots of good data.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-14 5
I love discovering new places in cities I love and tripadvisor helps me do just that. The city guide for NYC has opened up so many aspects of this amazing city and I am grateful to all those who have put this highly informative and practical content together. 

Whenever I feel like rolling the dice and follow the advice of those who have been there before this handy app is right there. I don't leave home without it
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-14 1
90% thru a restaurant review and Trip Advisor for iPhone 5 crashes.  My last time to try.

Easy to use
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-13 4
Use it on vacation most of the time. Good tools in it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-13 5
Very useful to use when traveling or even just checking out places at home
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-13 5
I live Tripadvisor.  I use it during all my travels for hotel, restaurants, and fun!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-13 5
Awesome
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-13 2
Annoyingly buggy at best. It's not very responsive when I hit the "cancel" button when Im looking at the pictures and the pop-up for push notifications comes up every time I open the app. Seriously, when I say "no" I mean no.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 3
The app should automatically go to nearest places when submitting a review. Also it should not have a min text limit of 200 characters so I don't wear out my thumb.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 1
Bad app. Almost impossible to find the way to do reviews.   This site and Members DEPEND on Reviews, it SHOULD BE EASY TO REVIEW Restaurants, motels etc.;   How can you contact website to ASK QUESTIONS, or Complain????
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 5
Wherever I go, this app has become my main source when planing a trip, from hotels, to restaurants, to things to do, this app makes traveling cost and time more valuable!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 1
Can't even write a good review cause I have not been able to use the app w/o it asking me every two seconds to rate it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 5
Love this app so far. I needed a restaurant tonight in a city completely foreign to me and this app delivered with a variety of choices, and the reviews were spot on.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 2
I tried to find a link to write a review on the iPad app because the website said it was having maintenance issues. I went to the hotel entry and there is no link to write a review. What is the problem here?

I am a loyal Trip Advisor fan but I hate the fact that using it on the PC, iPhone and iPad are all different experiences. I seem to find what I need fastest on the regular site. Best to stay with that.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 4
Little quirky. At times doesn't easily give you the business's phone number every time. You have to go to their website. However they do a good job listing everything and most reviews I've gone off of were spot on.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 5
You can find interesting places from anywhere. I love that option i hope in the future they could add more places
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-12 2
I used to like this app but now I'm annoyed since you can no longer star/save places like you could before the update. Why?
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-11 1
Not being able to log into my trip advisor account through this app renders it almost worthless to me.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-11 1
Impossible to navigate!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-11 5
I love Trip Adviser. It takes the confusion out of planning a trip. Helps me find good rooms, things to do, and great places to eat, at the prices I want to pay.  The reviews by people, who have stayed done and eaten at the places I am considering are such a great help.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-11 1
Terrible product, terrible app
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-11 4
Very helpful to find good restaurants and hotels
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-11 5
Helps you plan before you go. Enjoy while you're there. And remember where you went when you get back. Simply awesome.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-11 2
I was looking for a list of the top things to do in San Diego.  Can't find it.  Relatively useless app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-10 5
I always read people's review before I go to a restaurant or booking a hotel. Don't wanna your vocation be ruined by terrible food or crappy hotels? Use this!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-10 5
Any time we try someplace new, whether it be a hotel, restaurant or other large attraction, checking Trip Advisor is a must!  I appreciate the honesty of others and the ease of navigating through the site.  Thank you!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-10 5
Easy to use and great for travel. We can quickly find the best place to stay and eat all in one app!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-10 5
This is a great program.  I have been using Trip Advisor for a while and really appreciate the feedback from other travelers.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-09 5
Excellent homestyle cooking in a mom and pop atmosphere
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-09 1
you ruined a perfectly functioning app.  where is the index of hotel photos?  they are on a new app of hotels?!! what is the point of having two apps that are similar with the city one not having the photos because they are on the hotel app?  photos are essential when deciding where to stay.  if you have a non updated version of the city app, don't update or you will be extremely disappointed.  please put the hotel photos back on the individual city app.  and please don't mix the professional photos in with reviewer photos.  keep them separate like the good old days. this update crashes constantly.  i want to know what was wrong with the previous version because this update is a complete flop.
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-08 5
I use this app a lot. Very helpful!!!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-09-08 5

Not having a lot of time to plan vacations I rely on this app for all my planning and have found it to be really reliable.Time saved good choices and enjoyable times have resulted.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-26 5
Trip Advisor is a great site to find out of the way places and even ask nonbiased people what they think of a hotel or resort.  if you are traveling to a place it is a great resource to find a place to stay or to eat.  I have found many hole in the walls and also stayed away from some overrated places.

The City Guides are incredible!!  I lived in Boston a year and have been back more than 10 times, but i downloaded the City Guide and it was so helpful with numbers, directions, reviews, etc.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-26 5
Enables you to save your favorite places!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-26 5
Enough said.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 1
No matter how many times I restart the app and apply so it sorts the results by rating, the app continues to sort the results by distance. Absolutely worthless to me when there are 700 results within 10 miles and I'm looking for the top 10 results.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 5
Very accurate reviews!

Great Irish cuisine and wonderful ambience. Staff outstanding (Darren, Simon & Melissa). Coddle and fish and chips very tasty! Our favorites ! One stop in Dublin one should not miss !
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 5
Trip Advisor picks up where we used to rely on travel agents (are you old enough to remember travel agents?). I can always filter out the tourist traps and find the gems any destination has to offer, with just a few quick clicks in the mobile app. So easy, we rely on it and have never been disappointed!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 5
Great app, that always gives us the best advice! A must have app for all travelers!

So very helpful.  Already booking hotels and researching sites to see!  Nice to see comments from others!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-25 4
It's a very good crowdsourced travel site. Lots of reviews for many places ive looked and generally has at least a few recent reviews. 

Most useful for off the beaten path reviews. If I'm in NY or SF just ask a local.  I'm traveling a lot next month and will report.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-24 4
Great program to help find restaurants, although I wish there were a way to weed out fake reviews.  All in all good stuff!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-24 4
Very helpful! Always check prior to going to or searching restaurants. The advice is always right on!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-24 4
I'm using this to plan a vacation to Scotland and so far it has helped quite a bit. This is my first time using it to plan a trip and so far it has helped make planning less complicated. This app is very helpful but I will rate this app based on what it has helped me to do. Ultimately in the end it will be judged on how my trip will go with the use and help of this app. I will update my review once my trip is over.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-24 2
Slow,confusing navigation, activities ranking feels like sponsored ranking

Have found Trip Advisor to be very helpful. Used it this summer for our trip to Montana and Canada. If you read several reviews of a place, you can get an accurate picture. 
Stayed in some great places recommended. Will continue to use it when traveling.

I like this app, but it's nowhere as complete as the desktop version. For instance, on the desktop version you can see your profile, contributions, etc.
With this app, you don't have that option. I'll rate this app higher if you add this feature.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-23 4
We like to see what people say before trying a new place and this helps greatly. You can sort from the good and bad reviews and then decide.  The app gives a blank green screen sometimes when posting a review and some other glitches but don't let that stop you.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-23 5
Joined trip advisor this spring. I find the reviews to be very helpful and want to contribute. I've picked and ruled out hotels based on trip advisors' reviews.

I just ate at Mint restaurant in garden city, ny and wanted to submit a review. When I typed in the name, it auto-populates in the search field but doesn't show the restaurant in the search results. And there's no function to create a review for this restaurant. Very disappointing since I'm always getting emails from tripadvisor to rate places near me.  Additionally, it would be great if we can view all our reviews on the app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-21 5
After traveling for years and checking reviews through various sites, I've found that Tripadvisor has the most honest reviews. Now that I have the app for my iPad, I'm reviewing all of the hotels and restaurants I visit to give something back.

Good
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-21 5
This app is really helpful to get an idea of a place before you go I love it even though its other people's opinions. Some of us think the same more than we realize.

I love trip advisor, but am frustrated by the many bugs on the app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-21 4
Great app for planning
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-21 5
I downloaded this app on our recent vacation to Kona, Hawaii.  It helped us find the best beaches and things to do.  Helped us locate the things others had told us to see.  It's is a great app.  I recommend it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-20 3
I enjoy using trip advisor and would probably post more reviews if I could see a list and access my own reviews from the app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-20 5
Great!!!!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-20 5
Used it for our last vacation and were well-prepared after reading all the reviews!  Map could use some upgrades. But still great app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-20 5
Perfect trip app !
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-20 1
The developers did a terrible job with the app. So many little things are wrong - it's basically unusable. 

The biggest thing is the performance is slow. The mobile website is much faster. Not only that, the app doesn't give you a response for actions you've taken. For example, tapping on "more" from a list screen (which should be "back") takes forever to get to the "more" screen, yet the app doesn't give you any indication that your tap actually registered. So I end up tapping "more" multiple times and end up on the home screen, with my search results lost. 

There are a gazillion little things like this. 

The app is so bad that I ended up bookmarking pages from the mobile site (eg, restaurants in London) and adding those to my iphone home screen.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-20 4
Works as expected. No complaints so far!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-20 4
I love this app!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-19 5
Good enough
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-19 2
Initially, I loved this app. But now, while on vacation, and trying to write a review, I do not find it very intuitive.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-19 5
Was good to find places to go and things to do
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-19 5
Knowing real people have written real reviews puts one at ease when plenty of $$ is at stake. Fantastic app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-19 5
I love this app. Use it every where I go, even in my home town. I use the off line app for the cities it is available.  Can't say enough good about tripadvisor.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 3
If nothing else, this gives me a good place to start my searches. The reviews are usually up to date so I can trust the opinions to be accurate of the information i need now.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 5
Great app to use when finding hotels, Resturaunt and things to do.  Learning from other people with and current experience is great.  It also gives many different perspectives so you can get a more complete view.   You can learn about what you care about and also learn what you may not think to ask about.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 5
Great App but needs to add ALL airports.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 4
Be careful and take advice with a grain of salt. People will report negative before positive, but I find it an excellent help when I'm somewhere new
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-08 5
I use trip advisor at home when I want to read reviews about restaurants in the next town or state
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-07 4
Great tool for comprehensive hotel info. Also, great for tourism info.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-07 2
I see the reviews, ability to map, but where is restaurant description?   Maybe I'm missing something?
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-07 5
Tripadvisor is an absolute necessity!!  I travel all of the time and wouldn't leave home without it.  This is how I find delicious restaurants.  Likewise it's how I let other travelers know about great places I've tried.  If I encounter something unacceptable, then I can warn people about it as well.  I have the app loaded on my iPad and iPhone.  Sometimes there are quirks and it doesn't work perfectly, but for the most part it's great.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-07 5
This app is way better then others I've looked at, there could be improvements but nothing substantial, I love the things to do category!!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-07 4
We frequently use TA to find the best rated hotels, great reading the reviews from members. Restaurant reviews aldo reliable. Best of all is the Forum. Before any trip i go thru the postings and topics for the areas and then cut and paste comments into our own specialized travel guide. Great place to get answers re airports , stations, hotels, trains, itineraries....
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 5
Perfect app to help plan a quick getaway or trip.  I love the honest reviews of hotels, parks, etc.  No problems on my iPhone 4S.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 5
See above
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 4
This is a great app except for being extremely difficult to update/change/remove your review.  There needs to be a tab that allows the reviewer easier access for this.  Otherwise, Trip Advisor is a great app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 3
Cons: its so glitchy :( they should improve the support.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 5
I don't have a personal assistant but  my work requires a fair amount of travel.  This app makes me feel like I have an assistant taking care of my travel plans!  Love it.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 5
Thanks for a convenient way to check out businesses on the go.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 4
This app has been great! We just moved to a new state and I have used it to figure out where to go and where not to go!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 5
Very useful for traveler
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-06 4
Had a very pleasant dinner. My salad and seared scallops were very good. We ended up chatting with the two couples one other side of us, so the conversation was great. The staff are knowledgable and pleasant.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 4
Whenever I want to go travel, I'll first seek in trip-advisor see where to go~
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 5
I love this app. I travel a lot and never know where to eat but trip advisor always helps. It is good to know what real people think about places before you spend your money. I never go anywhere without trip advisor.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 5
Having utilized Trip Advisor to plan our European vacation I can say it is the perfect travel planning tool!  Beginning in San Francisco, we traveled to Munich, Florence, Vienna and back to Munich.  Each and every hotel was beyond our expectations, the recommended tours and sites were exceptional and we had the time of our lives.  We will certainly use this wonderful site again when planning vacations!
Version 7.0.1 2013-08-05 5
If you read carefully through the reviews, you can get a pretty good picture of the places.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 5
Trip advisor is an awesome tool to share with others experiences that you've had to allow others to see how a hotel, attraction, etc...is before they make their choice. So thank you for having this app!
Version 7.0.1 2013-08-05 5
I use TA regularly to help me research trips and find  lodging and restaurants.  I trust the reviewers and the comments are usually very accurate. Really wouldn't do without this app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 5
Honest opinions from visitors everywhere!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-05 5
On a road trip from LA to Washington State, trip advisor was so helpful!  We did not have many planned stops so we used the app to help us find places to stay and eat! Love it!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 3
We thought it was a good experience. Service was excellent!  The only complain was the presentation  of the lobster Roll, served on white toast with no lettuce or tomato, the lobster salad was excellent but the white bread took away from the taste!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 4
Travel a lot for work in the US and now globally. Also love to travel on my own time off and Trip Advisor is great. It has a lot of information. It is very helpful - from St. Louis to San Isidro. I highly recommend it to novice and seasoned travelers alike!  It is also easy to use and has a lot of really useful functionalities. Just remember that the reviews come from users so you should read a few before making a decision - and even potential check another source just for reference. And remember that it doesn't work if you are off line! So make sure - especially if you are traveling somewhere where you may not have data service to have a source handy that isn't dependent on being 'connected.' But then again - when are we ever not connected any more!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
Great app, no problems
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
DL it; you won't be dissatisfied.  ;-)
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 4
Nice while driving for food N attractions
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
I'm planning a trip to Italy for myself and several friends and the information and reviews on trip advisor have been invaluable.  How else would I know about cooking classes in Cortona? Or about which tours in Rome, Florence and Venice are the best value?
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 2
This app can be maddening to use. Been traveling past 3 weeks and the search/filter functions work poorly. It often removes my filtering requests and reverts back to showing me the #1, 2, 3 and so on restaurants. Not very useful in Paris with 8,000+ restaurants when I want specific types that fit a specific search request. Very frustrating to have to keep re-entering all the criteria. :(
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
I rely on this constantly to make decisions on where to eat!! And what to do!! When on vacation I have a rule that I will not eat at a chain restaurant, therefore I rely on trip advisor to tell me where to go. I have never been steered wrong!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
A pleasure to travel with.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
Very helpful and informative for both stateside and overseas.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 4
Trip advisor is a very helpful tool for those who like to travel, yet do not know the areas they are about to visit. I love the fact that it lets you upload pictures of places.
Version 6.0 2013-08-04 5
TripAdvisor is the best place to obtain information on hotels, air, dining, and other
Needed facts from real people who have traveled to a destination. The forums offer
So much information when planning a vacation or a day trip. Plenty of pictures help
people see what an area will be like! just the best source for travelers!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
great for a frequently flyer.  A must for visiting any state and country...
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 5
Gives great advice for saving money while traveling, and I get to find out about the attractions before I go! Love this app!!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 3
Overpriced. Portions were a joke. Much better restaurants to choose from
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 4
Need to allow for quick tap of phone number to call automatically and a tap of the address to go directly to nav.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-04 4
Excellent App.  Functional and friendly App.  Very useful for on-the-go travelers.  Love it!!!

This Is a must app if you do a lot of traveling.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 5

Fantastic advice.  Always spot on!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 5
My wife and I really enjoy traveling to places we are not familiar with. I have come to depend on this app to give me help on my choices of where to go, stay, and eat.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 1
Near me now used to work much better. Prefer the website which means I will have to wait until returning home before writing reviews. Wants to access everything about everyone I know on Facebook. Waste of my time writing a review that I can't post now.
Version 7.0.1 2013-08-03 5
My go-to app when traveling..love it
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 3
I love this app! It has been sooo useful for finding hotels and restaurants. I especially like the "Near me now" feature. However, it would be really helpful if some features like the saved restaurants/attractions were accessible offline since when traveling, it is not always possible to use Internet.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 5
My friend told me about hi while we were in New York. I've been using it for several months now & find it very helpful :) I love that the app helps U shop the lowest hotel rates available online!! For a frequent traveler this is a must have app!!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-03 4
Great app but I wish it could sort and/or rate based on which meal you would like for restaurants. I would like to find a great breakfast place but can't tell which is the best breakfast place.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
I have found that the information that seems to be true for the most part helps in deciding where to eat or stay. Great place to start looking for what you need to know
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
Have used this app locally/nationally/internationally. Just be aware of 'planted' reviews.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 2
It is interesting but I don't know why it's seems to be extremely slow and apparently you cannot upload images with iPhone devices.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
My go-to travel app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 1
The forum section of this app is appalling.  You can't save posts, follow posts, see any information about the person who posted (like if they are a destination expert etc). 
The search seems to be missing TONS of information!! So many hotels, activities, etc SHOW UP ON WEBSITE BUT NOT ON APP.
Also, you can't access your profile for messages or saved posts/information etc...
I have the app and I use the website instead...
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5
As an operations manager at a destination hotel and suites this app is great for seeing how my guests loved their stay or hated it. I love outing up reviews for my neighboring restaurants and hotels to help improve their business as well. My hotel recently moved up on our trip advisor rankings! Thanks for being there so I can hear what my guests likes and dislikes are!
Version 7.1.1 2013-08-02 5

This app is the best travel app I have used , I do not drive and I tend to walk around in most cities I travel 
I was in Prague a few days back and had no problem in finding the destination with my data roaming turned off ! 
And now I am in Berlin covering most of the city 
Love it !

I cannot understand why I am not able to pull up B&B's in the area? This needs to be addressed. There is no way to find them on the app.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-23 5
I have dinned at this restaurant a few times. Love this place! Food is excellent, ambiance is great, service is very good! Live music is a wonderful touch. I am 40 years old, and I always recommend it to my friends and clients. In my opinion it has class!

Well done
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-23 5
This is the first place I go to plan a trip or select a place to eat.  The feedback is reliable and by using the city- specific forums, I can get answers to incredibly specific questions by people who have been there, done that.  Couldn't leave home without it!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-23 5
No complaints...great Tripadvisor reviews all in an easy to use platform. New hotel price search is awesome too.

If you're a traveler and have an iPhone you should have this app

Version 7.1.1 2013-07-22 5
I have written a couple of reviews with it and it is easy to use.
For hard to find places it takes a little more effort, still  easy to use.

We don't use any other review site.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-22 2
This app really stops you from informing the public about places immediately.  It is not a good thing. It is not up to date  with information but they only want you to report on the information tripadvisor has from over 2 years ago
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-21 5
As we are driving into Salt Lake City we are deciding what to do tonight! Based on the choices & reviews posted on TripAdviser  we have decided to see Saturdays Voyeur -for the 2nd time! Let's hope that we still can get tickets for tonight's performance! If not we'll be back on TripAdviser! Did I mention that this TripAdvisor app is Great!

This app has been very helpful whether going on vacation or just trying a different restaurant around town. Definitely has made vacations more enjoyable!
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 5
This app always finds just what you need in the local are you are in.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 4
I always write reviews with this app instead of Urbanspoon or Opentable but since I travel a lot I found one major flaw in the program.  There is no easy way to add new places. I understand TA wants to verify the authenticity of all places but there should be a trust threshold that can be based off the number of reviews written or something since they already have the star system in place.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 3
I like Trip Advisor, but their app is slow and feels buggy.
If you have the patience to navigate through its, um, "quirks," then you can get to their good info.
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 5
We are members and use this app to plan and research our trips. We rate our destinations and enjoy the reviews written by others and find them helpful

Great, really helpfull, love it
Version 7.1.1 2013-07-21 4
I think it has a lot of potential. However, I was looking for a Casino & Golf resort in Mayetta, KS and I had to give you all the info!  Now it's there.  Good job on everything else.

Version 7.1.1 2013-07-20 5
I love this app! It allows me to share my experiences, and it's therapeutic to be able to vent about places that are less than perfect (sugarcoated). Also I can gush about wonderful places I've visited, and share my experiences with others! I like that some establishments take the time to respond to negative reviews. I love this app. It also helps me when I'm traveling to a place I've never been...so I can see what other people are saying so I can make a better decision on where to stay! Love it! :)

In a new town?  Not sure what to do?   Trust Trip Visor to give you plenty of options.    Even if you have lived there for years you will find new things to do all the time you didn't even know about.

Unable to save forum posts that are the most useful suggestions when out on a trip. No Saved Trips that you personally put together to assist you when out & about with your mobile. What good is that? Not many will find a wifi and open their laptop.

Recently injured in a car accident, I can't sit at the computer for hours researching information for my up coming trip and was worried I wouldn't be able to gather enough to do the kind of thoroughness I like. This app makes it possible for me to do so on the bus, or lying comfortably in bed. Thanks!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-08 5
I love to use tripadvisor for creating a wish list of all the places people recommend. Takes the guess work out of traveling. Would be even better if it proved an online travel agent for even more personalized experience.

Finally a tool that helps you find places to visit.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 5
I trust the reviews posted on Trip Advisor.  More reviews than other sites.  The Trip Advisor Off-Line Guides are awesome, too!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 5
This app is so useful. The list of information from this app is very complete. I especially like the pin point function which not only show the location of the place but also name of the place. So when I don't have wifi/ data roaming in a different country, it allows me to do a screenshot and use that as a reference in regards to cross street and what not when going local attractions near by.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 5
I traveled across country with my kids and was used Trip Advisor for hotels, restaurants, and Things to do.  Reviews were accurate and up to date.  The map was helpful in pointing me to locations, as well as providing addresses to input into my GPS navigation system.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 4
Good info to find out how people perceive various businesses and locations.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 5
So long as people keep keep providing reviews, it's a great resource!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-07 4
Works good, but when you look at a hotel it sends you to the top of list when you go back. This makes you scroll down to where you left off.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 3
I like the app but it has some bugs that are annoying, when I do a search and then refine the search it limits the options of filtering for distance or rating and I have to then do a new search to get the other to work, also when I go into a specific restaurant then go back out to the search page it takes me back out to the wrong search,
Needs work to be as good as it could be.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
It is my go to app. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to travel.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
An excellent database of collective opinions on Hotels, Resorts and Restaurants.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
I use this app all the time when visiting a new city to see what is the best thing to do as rated by other users.  Having the top ten or great things to do in a new location is the best way to spend what little time or money you have.  I have used in Las Vegas to pick a show and in FL to decide which tour to use.  In both cases the reviews were right on and this app is a great way to access that information without all the hassle of browsing the web. Using it this weekend to pick a restaurant in Big Bear, CA. The app is dependent on people putting in useful reviews which is usually the case.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 2
This APP would be a handy little too you if it wasn't so slow for the iPad.  I prefer user reviews over the traditional.  These are usually people "in the trenches" and do not get the special treatment.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 4
I really love to travel, and I really love the convenience and scope of this app. I've affectionately re-named this app Oyster. It truly is a "must have" for the avid traveler! :-)))
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
Just as good as the full site.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 1
When you search for something and they don't have it in their database the only option you have is to add the place or completely close out and get back in it to go back to the search bar.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
This app is so great. You can look up various restaurants in an area when you're out of town and hear what others have experienced. You can often spot a recurrent theme in reviews, "the seafood is great; don't eat the steak!" I find it indispensable. It's also fun to share your own experiences to help make the program even more effective.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
The app really helped us navigate where to go - and what to avoid.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 4
Has everything to be rated and you get brownie points for showing appreciation :) something someone deserves after showing hard work and passion
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
Very user friendly app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
Always comes through to find a great place to eat!

I like the app it's cool
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
Wonderful app
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
The trip advisor app is very easy to navigate and contains a wealth of information at your fingertips.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
I like it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-06 5
Awesome app!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
Trip Advisor is my 'go to' app when I'm researching hotels and vacations. I trust the reviews and have never been disappointed. The app is well designed and easy to navigate.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
This a great app, especially when out of town.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
Love this. I can check out places, things to do and know ahead of time about places. Thanks bunches.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
Good app, well supported
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 2
1. ALWAYS have to login again even when checking "remember me" (so I never login)
2. Type too small to read in reviews so must use iPad's accessibility feature - why can't TripAdvisor allow stretching and zooming in?
3. All the email links included in Trip Advisor forum posts are not linkable

Bottom line - I love TripAdvisor on the WWW but only tolerate it on the iPad for the convenience of accessing a quick list of restaurants in areas where Yelp doesn't have a strong presence.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
This is my #1 resource for planning and executing trips with my wife. We love to know what we are getting into when we go places, and also love that we can organize and explore potential options through the app when we are in new places. It makes it easy to be more adventurous, and the reviews are almost always spot on.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
App works great and the reviews are very helpful when choosing restaurants and hotels when traveling.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 3
When traveling, the "near me now" feature is not as helpful as it sounds.  Four things would improve this and make it more like Yelp.
1.  Show results on a map, not just a list
2.  Allow for searching by map area, so you can scan what's in an area you are walking towards, not just where you are that second.
3.  When dropping a pin on a map to show where something is the app also  needs to also show the blue dot for where you are.  Navigation is a bit difficult in an unfamiliar city if I can't see where I am in relation to where I want to go.  
4.  Directions should be given via google maps rather than Apple maps.   The Apple directions are only for driving.  This is spectacularly unhelpful when standing in the middle of an ancient European city and needing to walk or take public transport.  Google maps can help with both.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 4
It's a convenient little app. I think that some of the reviews are a little harsh. I wouldn't use this app exclusively. It compliments other apps. For example, who cares about maps! I have a Google Maps app for that.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
I like to be heard and this is a great place to do it so thank you.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
Great app! Very trustworthy and reliable! Always works as promised and delivers useful info and travel tips!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 4
I like that it gives you more info about the area. Like that I get more feedback how is everyone experience. And it give more knowledge where and what to do
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
I love trip advisor!! Be it reading reviews or writing reviews myself! I'm totally hooked!!! It's spot on!! Love it!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-05 5
Very Useful
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 5
Plannin a trip to Vegas for the fist time...I know there are sooo many things to do and see! This app is helping me plan the perfect trip to Vegas!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 2
I really like the trip advisor site. This iPad app just sits there and thinks a lot. Very disconcerting on a 4th gen device. Push the button on the reviews and it is taking a coffee break. 

I closed other apps thinking it was my system but even when operating alone it is pathetic.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-04 5
Always, always, always check out hotels on Trip Advisor before you check in.   I've used TA for years now, first on my computer and now on my phone too, and I have used it numerous times to find hotels.  Reviews are mostly reliable (you always have someone who has their own motives for writing an either really good or really bad review), but if you go by the majority you're fine.  Love TA.
Version 7.0.1 2013-07-01 5
Worked just fine for us in our 3 week trip to Europe.  Helped us find good food and lodging the only time we got a bad meal was when we didn't use it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
I use this frequently especially when traveling to find reliable food and fun options.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 2
I like the chance to read reviews by people who recently traveled to all sorts of places, including less popular destinations like Anguilla and Bonaire.  There is room for improvement, though.  It is hard to keep your searches confined to your location.  For example, I'm in Anguilla, and search for Bonjour Cafe and get someplace in New Zealand.  Also, when I look at the reviews, not all restaurants have information about the hours or price range, yet when I write a review, I don't have the option of providing that information.  Finally, places are not well marked on the map and there seems to be no way to correct that.  It would be nice to interface better with google maps to get more accurate pins.

I just downgraded my stars from 3 to 2 as I see I started this review a year ago, and the same problems exist still.  In addition to the above, when you look at a list of restaurants in a city, they will be listed in order of popularity but the second one will say something like #16 of 43.  There is no way to get #1 at the top, nor  see all of the 43. The list will scroll and show you 26 of the 43 restaurants with no way to search by name or keyword.

I had to resort to going to Fodors website to find something to explore, then return to TripAdvisor app to see if I could find it in the list.  Sometimes I could NDI sometimes I couldn't.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
I just downloaded the app an hour ago and already decided this is going to by source of travel info. Complete with maps, ratings and all relevant details needed for travel. Well designed and easy to use. Thank you, Tripadvisor!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 1
This app is the WORST. Navigating through it is impossible. The links frequently don't work, and when you click links to get a list of the "next 10" hotels, the page that loads does not have anything listed. You're much better off using the website.  The inability to navigate effectively leaves you walking in circles and having to look at hotels over and over again to make sure you've considered all of your options. I can't say enough about what a pain this is...
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
Love the Ap for travel.  Easy a d accessible.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
Tripadviser is THE best tool for vacation research.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
Use it all the time.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 1
Problems on the iPad - sorry but this is 2013 and the app should have the same features as the full site.  Could not see other locations while browsing a hotel. Very limited overall
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
We use this app for everything when we travel. Helps us find coffee shops, restaurants and gives hotel reviews. It also gives everyday advice on things to do. You have a great variety of opinions so read through lots before you decide!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
We use this app so much when we're traveling.  We find good places to stay, to eat, and things to do.  I always appreciate some little detail thrown in by the reviewers that gives me an idea of what to expect.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 5
Going to Barbados again and just wanted to see what the site listed. 
Everything I know about the island was there plus the reviews and advice from travelers very helpful. Can't say enough. I must have application. Also I live in NYC and I found so many great things to do. Plus price how long the activities and location direction. You won't regret it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-30 1
Wrote a review and the app lost it.

Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 4
Excellent, very practical
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 1
I have been very fond of trip advisor for at least 2 years now. I use them as tools when dining out but also for ways to improve my place of work. Recently there was a complete lie written about the manager, insult about the owner & a black mark (terrible mark) against the restaurant. The first. Trip advisor was contacted & said the person followed the guidelines. The person is using the persons name, full name in a defamation way. It's a complete lie & this person was not allowed to post on yelp or open table because a complaint was filed against her. But trip advisor allowed it. Why?
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 5
Great app, the best i have for travelers
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 5
Easy-to-use, only wish more people posted thanks they find in their local areas so people had a better idea of what they can do from a local perspective

Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 3
Flight tickets are the best price i've seen, so far but I do wish they would drop a bit here & then . People would buy them more! Just saying (: other than that I like it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 4
App needs portrait view so I can input information more easily.  Would get a 5-star rating with that!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 4
Can't easily find Attractions like website and cannot mark a review as helpful in the app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-29 5
We use this app in planning our trips and while on our trips for restaurants, clubs and sightseeing! Great help!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 4
I really enjoy using this app., not that I am retired and have plenty of time to read reviews and try new places.  Works great.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 4
I haven't used it much but I'm planning a trip for the first time and it has been helping me a bunch!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 5
Trip Advisor (with a little help from Google) is a great travel companion! We rely on the user reviews to steer us to the best attractions when we are on vacation. So far, everything has been on the nose!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 2
I like the old website much better. This one is hard to navigate. I wanted to check B&B's in New York City but it kept bringing me to only hotels.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 5
Love having this app available, especially when traveling.  You can get reviews of almost anything in a city or country right when you need it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 5
Have used it many times for domestic and international traveling
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 5
I like how the map figure integrates with the locations being reviewed to give you an idea of where they are located. Also like how you can zoom in and out on the map to modify options. Having noted these positives it would be nice if the app allowed one to vote for helpful posts. Overall this will be great for use while on the road to complement the full web version.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 5
Very helpful! Must have.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-28 5
We just returned from a 7800 mile driving trip from Oregon to southern Florida and back. We had no preplanned route or any hotel/motel reservations for the whole trip. Using a combination of Trip Advisor, IExit, the Starbucks apps and our GPS we were able to find a good to great room every night along with meals,gas and coffee.  Trip advisor made it very easy to look at prospective motels through the photos section. Reviews of the subject properties are kept recent, including pricing ranges and were, on the whole, right on the mark. It's easy to add comments about individual properties too. We informed the desk clerks at each hotel that we had found them through Trip Advisor and in a couple of instances it led to a room upgrade or cheaper price.  Trip Advisor is a great app in our book!!  Couple it up with IExit and you have a perfect tool to get you where you want to go.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 5
Really, none come close.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 3
Different views show different information which often requires digging in different places to put together a complete picture of ratings, price, menu, etc.  Tripadvisor is great but the app has a ways to go to catch up with the website.  It feels like sections of the app were written by different people and then kludged together.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 4
Where is the speciality lodging tab?
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 5
If I don't take a look at this App I think about the place twice.  Great App and features.  Two thumbs up!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 5
This is a great resource to have. I like road trips and to try different places. It's great to research ahead of time, but the road often doesn't take you where you intended. Its nice to find good eats and places to stay on the fly. Be honest as you would want to read a review.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-27 4
Fab App showing all the great places, activities, and food in any location you visit! I love reading real people's reviews of local attractions and their candid remarks. Often guides me.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 4
Love this app, very useful when we visit other places. Wish the map was better detailed.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 5
My family and I take long summer road trips stopping in cities along the US and I have always used Trip Advisor.  The app takes it a step further by allowing me to check out local "things to do" instantly.  Love it, it is very helpful when planning destinations.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 4
We have benefitted greatly in our travels from the reviews on Trip Advisor. We have tried restaurants & engaged in local activities we would not have known about, if not for consulting Trip Advisor. Keep up the good work & updates!!!!

Excellent travel app, and I really appreciate the saved items feature. I rate it 4/5 stars because it doesn't seem to have a way to link with your online trip advisor account - so what I save on my phone stays on my phone. I can't access it from other devices . If I'm wrong, someone please post the way to do this - Im all ears!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-26 5
I love Trip advisor
Whatever you are looking for you will find here
Real reviews from real travelers along with real pictures and not just hotel pics.
If you want the real deal before you take a vacation, this is where you should be before you make your plans.
You will NOT be disappointed!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-25 5
I have tried other rating apps and this is the best. More trustworthy than Yelp who has unscrupulous business practices. Urban spoon doesn't let you rate like Trip Advisor. My fav: Trip Advisor for both U.S and Europe.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-25 5
I use it for almost every trip. Hotel and activity info is extremely helpful.

There does not seem to be any way to search or view Bed & Breakfast lodging options from the iPad app. 
Is Trip Advisor going hotels only?
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-25 4
I use Trip Advisor all the time on their Internet site. But two issues with their app: 1) can't do multi-city flights and 2) can't choose Premium Economy as a travel class. These are pretty basic functions. Otherwise it is good.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-24 5
You find some really great values!
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-24 5
Great for looking great deals near  some places that you have to go!!!

Love the reviews and very away to use app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-24 2
I was hoping to replace Yelp and Foursquare with Trip Advisor. Disappointed I won't be able to. The deal breaker is you can't check in on a location.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-24 3
How can I manage my profile? I want to know what I have review, how many have been helpful. 
I can see all that on the webpage but not on the app...

I've been using trip advisor for years, and love this porting to iPad.

I use the site extensively for planning trips like the one we took to Hawaii. It helped us pick our hotel and the restaurants we ate at and the excursion we did.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-24 5
Antes de cualquier viaje, siempre busco el lugar y guardo los tips !! Me ha dado buenos resultados !!!

This site has proven VERY helpful in planning our family's European vacation. I especially like the Traveler photos posted for hotels.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 2
The upgrade to this recent app has created many hiccups. Makes is difficult and frustrating to use. Freezes often or won't respond. Not user friendly and annoying to try to get to your "saves" and other information.
Version 7.0.1 2013-06-23 3
This app even if you select view all saves still forces you to only see saves for one location at a time. I like Google + Local saves option much better. Outside of the saves and lack of professional reviews (I hate relying on user reviews) this is the most useful travel review app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-28 5
I am rarely disappointed
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-28 2
When searching for "things to do" in a given area, the app shows places/attractions that are not even close by. For example, a search for things to do in and around Sacramento pulls up a result from Catalina island. It even shows that result as being located a little bit north of Sacramento!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-28 2
It won't allow me to make my own place..like a new restaurant in town!!.. Really bummed.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-28 3
I think the map feature on the iPad app is confusing. Not ever sure how the location gets selected and if not familiar with city would prefer to select an area, ie downtown, airport, etc.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 5
I am a corporate pilot. I use this app when I have a day or a week somewhere new. Really helpful for setting an itinerary on the go. I would like to be able to email my wanderings though. Please add that capability to any update! Thank you!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 5
Great reviews written from real people.  I like to see things to do in cities before I visit them.  It also gives me insight into a hotel before I check in, like the gym or Internet costs.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 4
I like the "Things to do" feature.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 5
Been using this app for a mini trip and it has really helped with restaurants and attractions! Especially because most hotels now charge extra for Internet- why pay when you have an amazing app like this one!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 5
Use it all the time before we travel, a must!!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-27 5
The user interface is very, well, user friendly. Great to be able to access reviews quickly and easily from my phone. :)
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 5
Easy to use filters for searches and detailed descriptions abound.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 4
If you use an ipad from a foreing country, you only have the forums from your own country....for example.. I use german tripadvisor and if I search for hawaii in the forums I only see answers from german travelers. Not helpful at all!

Great app, no real problems
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 4
I actually enjoy using the app to get reviews on properties I plan to visit and make reservations. I would like for the calendar/my dates are flexible feature made available to scan the prices by the month like they have on the main site. Other than that, it really meets my needs.

Not a ton of hotels.. Can't put the amenities in that I want. Nor does it have all the locations..it use to be better than this... What happened?

I love the app and it's very easy to use. I wish you could choose to stay logged in and It would be better if you could do a lookup by location and pick from places on the map, similar to the way Yelp and Urbanspoon work.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 4
Especially for frequent travelers.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 5
Great app. It is a good TRIP ADVISOR.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 5
Very useful for foreign tourists or just a day trip in your own city. I love using it!!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 4

It helped me a lot..
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 5
I had never used tripadvisor before or even heard much about it. When I was researching my latest getaway I really just stumbled upon it. It is the best app I have ever used. I used it everyday on vacation for things to do & restaurants and directions. I would have been lost without it. The reviews were super helpful in picking out a restaurant to eat at and giving little helpful tips for things to do. I am going to San Diego next month & this will most definitely come in handy.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-26 4
Travel plan and booking made so easy...
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5
Using this app to ""re-find" all the places we left behind on a notepad at home.  !!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 4
There is a back button now, so that's good.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5
Very user friendly. Quick and easy way to find the best places to eat, sleep or play.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5

So...here we are. It is magnificent outside today in quaint Summerville ( a woodsy outskirts town outside of FABULOUS Charleston...ask me how we really feel). So, we enjoyed only FireFly sweet tea vodka & lemonade, and Lizzy (Chardonnay-of course).  We headed out to the "back garden" which is really a former parking lot (according to Michael). Well, the Chardonnay was Woodbridge? (But it's NOT a wine bar) and Michael's tea was yummy (and tried to be authentic Southern). Have to say that I have had brunch here... Eggs Benedict "Benny", and Michael says the burgers, fish 'n chips, and cheesesteak are delicious. He also mentioned "bloody mary bar on Sundays" WOW!  Ps...btw a giant Jenga, ping-pong, stage for a band...fun!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5

Just spent 18$ on my booking! Use "hotel tonight" and when sign up use promo: hoteltonight2
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 3
Great app, but every page should have a Share button allowing us to share what we're viewing... Via a copy URL, email, Facebook or Twitter post!  Who travels alone?  We want to share our ideas with those we want to go on the trip with us!  Get SOCIAL, TripAdvisor!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5
Where was this when I went to India? Great stuff and glad to be part of it!

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 3
Nice app.  Hate how while adding a favorite it loses it's place and I have to scroll through everything I already viewed.  Why can't I just scroll through none stop?  The viewing in landscape only is dumb!  

Even with the few downfalls, impressive app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 3
The 'sort +filter' option needs obviously more filters just like in the full site. Also, when clicking on "full site" option, it doesn't take you to the full site at all but the mobile version; please fix. 

In overall, the app is not bad but I'm not crazy about it, I find myself quitting the app and going to the desktop site on my computer instead for the lack of filters and several of the many options on the desktop site.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5
I love the site and now I love the app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 5
Best app for local and traveling.

As a frequent traveler I like to research the places I am going prior to my visit. Trip advisor allows me to see tips that have been successful with previous travelers! Wonderful app!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-25 4
Love this app, only problem I've had is that it won't let me log in. It tells me to log in, then says there is no account under my email, so I try creating an account and it says one already exists under my email. Very frustrating.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-24 5
All in one I like this.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-24 4
Tripadvisor's crowd sourced content seems to be the most reliable no cost guide to restaurants and hotels around. It works for me.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-24 5
This app is what i have been looking for.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-24 4
I use it all the time. Love it!

Great to have.  Don't leave home without it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-21 2
The app is slow and laggy. Needs a lot of back-end work. Compared to Yelp or Facebook, this app is very poorly made. I expect much more from a leading public company.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 5
We do not step foot into a hotel without
checking trip advisor! 
It has never let us down, always fine the best hotels!
Great when traveling to show you all the good things to see/do in area.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 5
Such a great help when planning a trip. Five stars.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 1
Restaurant was closed but a revue was written two weeks later saying they had just been there.  How many other reviews are wrong, fabricated or misleading?
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 5
Its so useful as the guidance when you are miles from home to get some place to stay.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-20 4
This app helps me plan my days and dining experiences on trips. Very helpful for selecting hotels as well. Easy to enter reviews from IPad. Wish I could see all my behind the scenes data and reviews from my account like I can on the pc.

The app is a bit hard to navigate, and hotel filtering took time to figure out, but the reviews and ranking information was indispensable on our trip.

I love the app and site I use it everyone we travel and now just as much for local stuff . I love to write honest reviews. Helps make the places better i think who knows who cares

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-19 5
Great to know the must do's when traveling to a new place!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-19 1
I'm extremely disappointed in the map search function.   Search hotels -> Select City -> Enter Dates -> View Availaible hotels on map.  Except the hotels aren't available.  The designers of the app require the user to check availability for each hotel on the dates entered.  This is disrespectful of the user's time.  What's the point of the app?  I can search individual hotels using a Google search that places hotels' icons on a map.  

Also, null pointers or other general careless use of memory leads to frequent crashes.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-19 5
I really enjoy the app.  It is easy to use as both a user and a contributes.  I highly recommend it
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-19 5

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-18 3
The idea is worth 5*

The app for an iPad is worth only 3 because of the number of bugs or intentional functionalities that make the app somewhat frustrating to use.

This is my favorite app and before that it was my favorite website. Incredibly easy to use and informative. First place I look when I'm thinking about traveling and usually I don't have to look anyplace else for the info indeed. I trust this the info on this app completely and also trust the reviews that travelers post too. Solid 5 stars.

I love this app but I noticed you can't share pages.  I was researching restaurants for an upcoming vacation and I wanted to email or text my wife one of the restaurants.  Unfortunately, no such luck.  I can't do it.   

But otherwise, it is a great and extremely useful app.  It has made planning a vacation so much easier.

Version 7.0.1 2013-05-12 2
Nice app that seems to do most things it can fairly well w/o crashing, but not everything from the web is available here.  Not that I trust their references but I prefer getting the best info from the forums.

Tripadvisor has the best and most comprehensive travel site.  I use it for every single trip-- for every aspect-- hotel and restaurant reviews- and for tips on places to see. Love the ease of using it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-11 5
If you travel a lot, this app is for you, a must have
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 2
I would give this app five stars but you need a back button. I love trip advisor and use your app daily for different trips I have planned. This new update makes it impossible to go back.  You have to start over when ever searching the forums. Please fix!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 5
My boyfriend and I used trip advisor to help us plan our trip to Belize.  With Trip Advisor you can view other people's reviews about where to stay and photos from their trips. We managed to plan our fantastic trip to Belize by reading reviews and I'm so glad this app is available to anyone.  It's easy to use, and I have already posted 2 reviews at the two resorts we stayed at.  Hopefully other people will find my reviews to be helpful as I did with theirs.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 5
I used trip advisor to plan excursions on our western Mediterranean cruise. Excellent choices and huge savings from cruise ship options!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-07 3
Since the last app update you can no longer go back page from a forum post you are reading. If you are 3 or 4 pages in to the forum posts and you click one to read, you have to go back to the most recent post instead of where you were in the list. Basically like the app. Read trip advisor on my computer which is better, but the app is ok if you know where to navigate.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-06 5
We used this app extensively over the past 2 weeks on a 6000 mile round trip road trip and found it to be fairly accurate and very easy to use.  We started using the website first and then saw there was an app, YEAH!!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-06 5
As a frequent traveler to some remote/unusual places, I use this app all the time. It has saved me from some horrible hotel experiences. Truthfully, I use this more than almost any app on my phone. Wouldn't want to travel without it!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-06 1
Worthless to me since I can't use the important function of reading the forums without having a back button.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-06 5
I love this app.  Great tool for finding things close by.  The list of reviews are very helpful when trying to decide the best place to gp.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 5
This app is very helpful for trip planning or simply exploring.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 3
One of the best things about Tripadvisor are the forums that enable travelers to get really specific questions answered from local experts. Sadly, the functionality of the forums on the recent version of the app lacks a back button, making navigation around the forums excruciating and tedious. Please fix this!! Otherwise this is such a useful tool on the go.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 5
Great app for looking up reviews worldwide!
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 5
I travel quite a bit and use this app almost daily while on the road. I cannot remember a time when the reviews by other travelers has let me down and lured me into and establishment not worthy of my time and money. This is a must have for 'road warriors'...

Great app!! Love the way you can search just the right area for what you want/need!! Love it!?
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 2

My number one app when I am home and traveling! Tons of ideas on things to do, where to eat, etc. I love this app!

I always use this app when I'm out of town , or when a friend in a near by town asks us out to dinner - I'm always checking the ratings ! Just got back from Nevada and of course used the app to point me to a good restaurant - things to do etc. *****
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-05 1
It's impossible to do your trip advisor reviews.  What is the point?
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-04 1
Great site, terrible app.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-04 5
Great way to get an overview of any place you're considering for a trip. And all the clutter from the website is gone; the app just shows you what you need. Love it.
Version 7.0.1 2013-05-04 5
very effective finding comparison service quality n review
Version 7.0 2013-05-01 2
The app is nothing more than their website shrunk and reorganized to fit an iPad's screen. Two serious problems beyond the clunky layout and too-small controls:

1. The app doesn't work in portrait orientation. This is the only app I own -- of over 100 -- that doesn't function in the iPad's natural portrait orientation.

2. Scrolling is incredibly buggy: trying to scroll through reviews is an exercise in frustration, since taps and gestures are routinely ignored.
Version 7.0 2013-05-01 5
Outstanding!  Versatile, wide-ranging and very informative!  'Hope it works on my cruise ship...  :^)
Version 7.0 2013-05-01 5
I love trip advisor!!!!
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 3
I can't seem to find the option for flexible dates when searching flights.  Is that still a feature?  If yes, please tell me where.  If not, it's a problem.
Version 6.6 2013-04-30 5
Simply the best traveling resource available.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 1
Not user friendly.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 3
This version of the app feels less iOS-native than the last one. It doesn't "feel" good as I suspect the app is a simple wrapper around inelegant HTML. Navigation icons have been removed everywhere in favor of a hidden lefthand menu which makes basic use of the app more difficult. All in all a disappointing app execution housing excellent data.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 1
There was nothing wrong with the old version, and this new one eliminates one of the apps most useful features: previously your saved restaurants, hotels, etc, were automatically sorted by location, now all of them are shown at once which is really confusing.

True you can ask to see your saved hotels in say only Chicago, but if you then want to look for your saved restaurants in Chicago, you have to do a second sort.  This is a pain especially when you are in a location with a poor signal.

If you don't have this app, it's certainly worthwhile, but if you do take a careful look at the latest version before you upgrade.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 4
Cool app, very helpful .
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
What a wonderful app to have when traveling! Truly a traveler's tool!
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
Great stuff
Version 6.6 2013-04-30 3
When I'm traveling, the last thing I want is an app that consumes my bandwidth like crazy. The new bigger pics are not an improvement. They help use up my account allotment and my battery by taking longer to download. Think it through next time please!
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
This app is almost everything I wanted in a vacation planner.  You enter a location, and Trip Advisor brings up all the Things to Do, Restaurants, and Hotels.  I found activities that I would have never found elsewhere, and would have missed out on.  I go through all the things to do, save my favorites, and my family and I whittle it down.  It would be nice if you could add your own notes, have a vacation budget planner, and print itineraries.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
We use the recommendations regularly to find restaurants during our travels. We are rarely disappointed. Need I say more?
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
A great way to plan your next trip!
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
Use it often. Lots of reviews available. And I get to share my experiences as I travel.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 1
Still landscape only.  So weird.  Every other app has the ability to go either direction.  Too bad.
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
I have used Trip Advisor for several years. Never go anywhere without consulting Trip Advisor reviews. I've not been steered wrong yet
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 5
By far the most helpful travel app around!
Version 7.0 2013-04-30 2
Every time I log on to my TripAdvisor account through Facebook on my iPod Touch, it crashes. I am only able to sign in through my Facebook, but it won't let me in. This glitch needs to be fixed.
Version 7.0 2013-04-29 5
I love it
Version 6.6 2013-04-29 5
I have come to rely on this app, it is excellent when traveling on business or pleasure. I no longer have to research ahead of time where we are going to eat, I just pull up the app and usually have something picked out in under 10 minutes. Same for attractions, I love that you can sort by popularity, this gives me a quick way to find things for us to do in an area we have never been.

I've been using this app to plan and manage an overseas trip. It has Ben great so far withstand couple of minor issues. When left running in the background on some modes, I think it keeps location services on which seems to be draining my battery faster than usual. I'm not sure if it is that, or in just using it more than normal. It'd be great if there was a way to see my "saves" sorted by distance as well as a way to mark them as seen. Finally, when I'm using this while traveling, I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review, but remind me later waits about 5 minutes and them pesters me again, so a star off for that.
Version 6.6 2013-04-29 5
Wonderful for everything to do when you travel.
Version 6.6 2013-04-29 5
This is one of those apps that feels like a perfectly formatted version of the web page.  Thanks!
Version 6.6 2013-04-29 5
Use it every time I plan a vacation.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
I travel ALOT for work I'm always on the road in different places this app makes things like hotels and places to eat super easy to find
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
I use their site on my computer and this is almost as good on my iPad. Easy to navigate, gives pertinent information, very useful reviews by members that do a lot of traveling and links to many other sites. It really is useful.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
Unlike other apps for reviewing, this one gives more realistic reviews. As for this app, works better than the droid version I recently was using. Fast searches and better stability.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
This app has been very useful to me while dating online. Very helpful for trying out new places to eat.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
I have been using this app for more than a year , and definitely is the best travel app in the market , is the only way to know by fellow travelers what's happening in the city your are visiting related to hotels, restaurants , tours etc.

Keep improving !!!!
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
Very helpful for making major decisions about traveling
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 4
I do wish there were better mapping functions. I'd like to be able to plan activities and eating near each other or on transit lines.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
I've been contributing to TripAdvisor for many years now.  It is the first place I check when heading to a new area for information on hotels, restaurants and activities.  The app on my iPad makes it easy for on-the-go reviews.  It is easy to use and quite intuitive in how it works.  No complaints.
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 5
Very usefull!
Version 6.6 2013-04-28 4
Love the app but wish the menu had a section showing restaurants I've reviewed.
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 5
I use this app all the time to read reviews about hotels and restaurants. I am also an avid reviewer myself. I like the simplicity and efficiency of the app.
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 5
Love this app !! Covers it all !!
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 5
Works flawlessly
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 1
Many functionalities (e.g. Ratings) are not working properly on iPad.
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 5
Been using it for years. Love it for finding new place while traveling or when in a new place to live.
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 5
Nice for travel!
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 5
Great app

A travelers BEST friend.
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 4
I have Tripadvisor on all my Internet devices.  We have used it frequently for our overseas planning and information.  Try it. You will be pleasantly surprised.
Version 6.6 2013-04-27 3
I can't get signed in using Facebook. Annoyed. I know I have an account because I'm logged in on another device.
Version 6.6 2013-04-26 5
Pure concentrated awesomeness!!
Version 6.6 2013-04-26 5
Best travel app yet!
Version 6.6 2013-04-26 5
I love this app. It offers everything from the website all in the palm of my hand.
Version 6.6 2013-04-26 5
My go to app anytime we leave town!!  Love the honest reviews and real photos.
Version 6.6 2013-04-26 5
I use Trip Advisor for researching everything when going to a hotel, restaurant, or an activity.  By providing information about the reviewers, I am able to find those with credibility and reviews the way I write them.  It is especially help to read the insights and suggestions offered by other reviewers.  These are very helpful, and that is why this app is on every device I use.  This app is indispensable.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
I almost always look at reviews before I travel for work or pleasure to get a sense of how the properties are performing. Doesn't take long to sort out which places are doing a good job. One bad review does not a bad experience make but if you see several it might be time to re-think your plans.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
Very helpful. Up to date in most of the reviews. Finally an app where common people can share their experience about a certain place without to put up with the "professional critics" high demand.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
Of all the websites on the internet, this is definitely the best
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
No crash for me.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 2
While I like the site and use it often, the app is clunky, unintuitive, and pretty bare bones. Not much going on with it, and missing far too many functions (like results sorting) that make it a headache to use. Deleting soon.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
Of all the Internet sites Trip Advisor offers the ease of making adventures come true!
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
Very easy to use, and fast. Prefer the app when traveling for wick searches.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
How we booked our first trip together!!!
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 4
Pretty much awesome. Would give it five stars if it helped me find even more adventures.
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 1
The maps are on and then off and occasionally doubles the selection, probably causing the map failure, lousy program upgrade .
Version 6.6 2013-04-25 5
So far, of all my apps, I am the most impressed by this one. I am planning a driving trip in California and selecting my hotels using this app as I virtually drive up the coast. Very cool.
Version 6.6 2013-04-24 5
On every trip we take I dont go anywhere until I check Trip Advisor! It never steers me wrong and it is so helpful to have. i love reading everone elses reviews and then checking it for myself most of the time they are on point others not so much but its good to get pointers so we dont get blindsided. I love this App
Version 6.6 2013-04-24 5
I love and use this on a regular basis. I travel extensively and use this for dining at least 3 times a week. So much better than urbanspoon, whose GPS app rarely has any accuracy.
Version 6.6 2013-04-24 5
Love having this app on my iPad mini so I can research and plan for my trip to Venice whenever I get a spare moment!!!!  Haven't had any problems with anything so far.
Version 6.6 2013-04-23 5
Gives the traveler good insight.  Always chk the hotel or restaurant website for latest info.  I've used TA for years.  iPad app is super.
Version 6.6 2013-04-23 4
This is excellent software, getting better.  Not there yet.

Map functions freeze and lock unexpectedly, might be network related, but might not be too.

Map zoom function is oddly disconnected from the selection.  I look at a property in the detail view, then click to see on map, and then zooming the map causes the selected property to recede into the mass of other flags.  It's hard to view a selected property in context of the larger map.  This is highly counter-intuitive and should be addressed.

Search and other functions work well and nimbly.  Interface is attractive and easy to understand. I like the owner response function, very enlightening.

Overall, this app and network seems less puerile than Yelp and therefore more reliable.
Version 6.6 2013-04-23 5
It's really great to use trip advisor for the information of hotels all around the globe..
Version 6.6 2013-04-22 5

Buena app
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 5
I got hooked on the TripAdvisor website while planning my honeymoon, and was really happy to find that the app has all the features of the site. It's amazing that you can even get hotel prices all within the app. Very useful.
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 5
Awesome
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 5
Very easy app to use. You can save your favorite spots so you don't have to keep searching. Updates instantly.
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 5
I usually don't rate apps.... But this is a great app.
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 4
Just downloaded app. Starting to plan first trip outside U.S. Has been very helpful thus far. Guess I'll know how good it was when I get back.
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 5
It's so helpful in planning my dream vaca!!!

Its not like any good native app. there is no proper navigation animation and flow. zero smoothness, slow, worst design.
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 5
Use this App all the time.
Version 6.6 2013-04-21 5
This app is my most used app! I can get info on just about everywhere I go, loved it on my comp and  happy to carry it where I go, good job!!!
Version 6.6 2013-04-20 4
But why not add a feature that allows users to share newly discovered thingstodo.

On vacation with the family and was able to find things to do very easily using the Trip Advisor app as my only resource.
Version 6.6 2013-04-20 3
So awesome! Very helpful
Version 6.6 2013-04-20 3
Getting use to newer version still like the web site better.  So I'll bump up to three stars
old review below...
Updated version is terrible, let me have the old one back please

We love this app and take it everywhere we travel. It helps us narrow down where we should eat, stay and play,
as sometimes we can't seem to make up our minds.  Everywhere we have chosen off of Trip Advisor has been spot on, and when we travel we want to have great experience and Trip Advisor and fellow travelers make that happen! Thanks and fellow travelers keep up the great writing and sharing!
Still love this app, used it 4 times just today!
Version 6.6 2013-04-20 5
I use tripadvisor for every vacation. The reviews are from everyday people w/o bias opinions. Trust it completely.
Version 6.6 2013-04-20 5
Easy to use on the iPad or iPhone for traveling and quick searches for restaurants. For trip planning its better to log in on a computer to see the full application.
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 5
Very convenient with all the same features as regular tripadvisor.
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 5
When traveling away from home don't leave lodging and dining to chance. Seek the experiences and comments of those before you first then make your own conclusions.  This is a very good and reliable resource.
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 1
Clicking the button to log in with Facebook opens the Facebook app which tells me I have already authorized tripadvisor. Clicking Okay reopens Tripadvisor which tells me it is unable to retrieve Facebook profile data. I have tried signing in and out of both apps, and closing both apps, but the bug persists.
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 5
We travel the world a lot and this is the perfect app to help us identify restaurants and hotels. We find it far more useful and up to date than the guide Michelin. We have found the reviews all very useful and accurate. I would strongly recommend it
Version 6.6 2013-04-19 5
We use to book our vacations and reviews from travelers are very helpful.  App works great!
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 5
Always use trip advisor and you will always make a great choice!!
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 4
Good
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 4
We use Trip Advisor almost exclusively when we are planning a trip.  We spent two weeks in Canada last summer and planned the entire trip thru Trip Advisor.  While planning the Canada trip thru Trip Advisor we found the Gypsy Guide which enhanced our trip and made it much more informational.
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 1
unable to review, keep asking to fill a form even all fields are filled

Definitely the best app for travelers. You have the options you need when choosing a place to stay and the ratings are pretty reliable. Glad I chose it.
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 4
I really enjoy seeing reviews of just about every place of interest you can think of going... The database is huge and lots of traveler articles--- my favorite.

Best for finding great rooms and great food.
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 5
We use this app to choose hotels, restaurants, etc., especially in big cities. I love both the pictures and tips from other travelers, real people. It is invaluable when traveling, much like having a bunch of spies around the country (or world I guess) giving you advice. Love it!
Version 6.6 2013-04-18 5
Use it all the time. If there are poor reviews I just don't go there. Very trustworthy.

I found this app great to know places or at least for reading reviews of hotels and restaurants before you visit them.this app is lacking several services performed in the web. It would be fantastic the app had a plan my trip functionality, instead of things to do (lacking schedules) but I remark the app and web site are sync'ed. Certainly better than yelp.
Version 6.2 2013-04-13 5
Ive used the app at home and on every trip ive taken. It was very usefull on our honeymoon in New Zealand.  The reviews were accurate, the telephone numbers where correct. Overall its a ver usefull app and very userfriendly.

This app was very helpful when I decided to go to Phoenix area without doing much planning ahead of time.  This, along with Yelp, are nice to have when thinking about doing something new.  Its nice to know what others think of something before you try it yourself.  I recommend this one for the traveler or the person wanting to experience something different.
Version 6.6 2013-04-12 5
Perfectly points a traveler in the right direction.  Locating nearby providers and sorting by rating takes the guesswork out of travel decisions. 
Get this app!
Version 6.6 2013-04-12 5
Must have !!
Version 6.6 2013-04-12 5

There is no more helpful tool when researching travel. It is chocked full of helpful info. If you don't use it, you are crazy. I have one request. If you are looking for B&B's, there is no way to get to the whole ranked list for a city. I was surprised to be infuriated with this wonderful app when trying to get to this simple category when looking for it for Edinburgh. There needs to be clickable access on every b&b review to get back to the master list and in the drop-down HOTEL menu b&b needs to be a choice. Sorry to complain but who needs to get infuriated just trying to get to the treasure trove of info. Shouldn't happen. Keep doing a wonderful job but please fix this.

When searching my IPad for a hotel to rate this past weekend I could not find it. Felt so strong about how great and dog friendly the hotel was I wrote a note to Trip Advisor.  Timely and friendly response from staff.  Went to phone app and sure enough its there. Oh that great hotel with an outstanding staff which is extremely DOG friendly is Country Inn & Suites by Carlson, right off I-95 in Port Orange, Fl. Great stop for folks heading to South Fl or the Keys. Also within minutes of Daytona Beach.

I use this app for any travel I do.
Version 6.6 2013-04-11 1
I have tried to get information on TA and all I see is this statement that the review has been removed. What gives? At this rate, TA is of no use to me

I love this app, we use it all the time. However it will not allow me to log in with Facebook on my iPad. It says in Facebook the app is authorized but will never log in.. 

Does the same thin on my wife's iPad as well.
Version 6.6 2013-04-11 1
When I first downloaded TripAdvisor to my iPad about a year ago it functioned great. But now, after recent updates, it's user friendliness and functionality has gone down. It shuts down a lot. It says I'm not connected to the Internet when I am. And this is just to name a few issues. I will always use TripAdvisor, but it's unfortunate that my favorite devise to access it, no longer works as well as it use to.
Version 6.6 2013-04-11 5
Is quick, easy, but above all is the cheapest way to fly
Version 6.6 2013-04-11 1
Use Google forget about this bad program
I had a great dinner the other night at a restaurant which had bad reviews on trip advisor. Some of the reviews were complaints that they were booked or they tried to get a reservation. This place didn't have any availability or they were closed so they left bad reviews. what a joke. Trip adviser gives a mouth to anybody with an opinion whether it is right or wrong so mostly you get people that just complain that haven't even gone to the restaurant or gone to the museum or gone to any of the things that they experience. Try Yelp or word of mouth way overrated and bad customer service. Phone books might start being useful again.
I'm deleting after the review because it is not useful.
Thanks for all the whiny worthless reviews :-(
Version 6.6 2013-04-10 5
Something must have changed with this app? I like it, and never did before. It's very user friendly, easy to say if a review was helpful and to write a review. Is that is what is new? The ability to write reviews on the app?? It's great, whenever on my iPad will use the app over the website.
Version 6.6 2013-04-10 5
It is nice to use trip advisor, you really get good ideas from the places you visit, I definitely recomend it.

Version 6.6 2013-04-09 5
Stable on original iPad. Easy to navigate; intuitive. Top-rated hotels show up on map, but you can find others by searching if they fall further down the list.  I like how you get that screening function so you don't waste time looking for lousy hotels.  Large user base, so you will likely find several reviews for any given choice.  Note:  I have used TA to search for hotels only, not attractions or food. Like the links to travel websites like Orbitz, etc. makes it easier to find rates.
Version 6.6 2013-04-09 5

The app, itself gives you access to virtually everything you need to know to plan your trip.  For a particular site, hotel, etc. for which you need to know more, the app has a built-in web browser which takes you to iPad-friendly web sites.

Faster and easier to use, too, I think, than their website.
Version 6.6 2013-04-06 2
The overall layout is well organized, in some ways better than the website.
Unfortunately, I found the hotel locations on the map can be VERY, VERY WRONG.
Example:   I searched hotels in Sitges, Spain.  The hotels listed in the left column are shown on the map as A, B, etc.  However, at least three of the hotels were shown pointing to the wrong dots, including the two highest rated hotels, the Galeon and the Platjador.  The latter is shown at a location probably 150m or more from the beach promenade, whereas it actually is right on the promenade.  Also the location of the Parrotts Hotel was off by over 1/4th mile.   
This completely misleads the reader, especially if location is a prime criterion.   The website maps appear to be correct.

I could not find a way to report this flaw to TripAdvisor.  The app needs a feedback function so they can correct errors such as this. 

If the map locations were correct, I'd probably rate 5 stars.  As it is, it only deserves 2 stars.  

BEWARE of this potential bug for any search on this version.

Update:   The map problem is even worse than it thought. 
Searching hotels in Madrid, the location of Atlantico on Gran Via ended up on C. de Alcala about 1/2 mille away.  And the locations of the Atlantico on Gran Via was labeled as the Hotel Regina. 

It is possible that the incorrect locations arise when you zoom or move the map  --- but in any event it is a major bug!

Have used Trip Advisor on all my trips since downloading the app. I enjoy reading the reviews and adding my own. Cuts down on the trial and era of finding a good place to eat or stay.
Version 6.6 2013-04-06 5
This is such a great app.  I travel a lot and this helps narrow down what hotel would best fit my need .... Absolutely love this
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 5
I don't travel without it!!
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 3
I'm a big fan of Tripadvisor, mainly because it provides a way for consumers to keep providers honest. However, the ratings don't provide you with the perspective you need to make a decision: a hotel could have fantastic ratings, but all entered by backpackers on a low budget, which isn't useful to you if you're on a business trip and/or looking for something a bit more upscale. More than the rating itself, what I'd like to know is: who are the people providing those ratings? What are their standards?
As for the app itself, I don't like it. I can't find any of my reviews, for example - it isn't personalized to me at all.
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 4
This app is extremely useful for finding information on US and international cities. It has more locations listed than yelp!
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 3
I like this app but it is a bit frustrating because it is not fully synchronized with my Tripadvisor profile on the actual website. I have been using the "vacation rentals" feature quite a bit on the website, saving properties and keeping notes on them. But to my dismay, none of this shows up on the app.

Decent app tripadvisor, but stil need to work some more to get 4 or 5 stars from me.
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 5
I never travel anywhere without first checking on trip advisor on tips on what to do or where to eat....love it!!
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 5
I enjoy using it and always check it before I go anywhere
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 5
This app always works & is very informative. Love it.
Version 6.5 2013-03-22 3
It's a shame when the web site is actually better than the native app. I only give it three stars because TripAdvisor is such a great service to travelers. Formatting is optimized in the app for the iPad, which is nice, but I find myself hitting the web site to find B&Bs. Love the service, but for me the app was not a favorite.
Version 6.6 2013-03-22 4
Yelp lead me to a Denny's in a bad neighborhood in California.  Never again.

This app always comes with us! Very helpful to have. Glad to have a review site like this.
Version 6.6 2013-03-21 5
I use this whenever I am thinking about taking a vacation, so I know what fun things I can do, what great restaurants I can discover, and where I can rest at night! Perfect!
Version 6.6 2013-03-21 5
Used a lot in a trip to Spain, very helpful and accurate.
Version 6.6 2013-03-21 4
Allows me to get an idea what is available in the area I am traveling in.
Version 6.6 2013-03-21 4
As a frequent business traveler, I always check tripadvisor before heading into a non none restaurant and find it to be spot on most of the time.
Version 6.6 2013-03-21 5
This App is like asking dozens of neighbors what they thought of a certain place they visited. It's a must do on any trip planning.
Version 6.6 2013-03-20 4
Overall the app is pretty good although I often can't find what I am looking for with the search, even if I use English or the local language spelling.
Version 6.6 2013-03-20 4
A very helpful and user-friendly app!
Version 6.6 2013-03-20 3
This app works pretty well, when getting directions it jumps to google like map but doesn't keep your,current location. Though it was user error but it did it more then once

Use it all the time!

This app has been invaluable for travel. I consult it on every trip and have never been surprised. The reviews are descriptive and accurate.
Version 6.6 2013-03-19 5
I've travelled in and out of the U.S. And have found this app indispensable. I always check it out once I book a trip. This time I actually used it to find a place to go!

Current version won't allow me to plug in travel dates, calendars are all wonky. Worthless -- how can I plan a trip?
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 3
The app doesn't work as well as just going to the website.  Searching locations is frustrating. Online, you can, for instance, pick an island, and it will either rank hotels across the whole island or give you it's rank by city/area.  With the app, neither option works very well.  

Also, I attempted to write a review on the app, but then realized I had no option for the specific ratings (i.e. cleanliness, service, value, etc.).  Without those rating options, leaving a review does nothing as far as ranking the hotel.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
I'm looking in a few upcoming vacation spots and this app helped a lot with my itinerary! Great app!
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
Love TripAdvisor as a website and now as an app! The interface is easy and I've never experienced a problem with the app and I review a lot!
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 4
I prefer it to Kayak and Travelocity
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
I use Trip Advisor on line for all my travel plans.  And, I am delighted with this application!  I can find a place to eat something to do in must minutes from where I am - important when trying to avoid whining children or grumpy spouses!  Our trips to New York and Orlando using Trip Advisor meant great meals every time.  We would plan some of the big events ahead of time - like Broadway shows - but wanted to be able to be impromptu and decide on some things at the last minute - the United Nations tour, or shopping at local fun stores.  I always download the new city guides on to my iphone before travel!
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
The FIRST site I go to for advice on what to see and do for a city I plan on visiting. Especially when planning a quick trip. Tons of photos and info that always are spot-on for helping me quickly determine if something is right for me. It has never let me down.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
Simple but powerful way to check new things out when traveling and to leave reviews for other people to check out.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
A must for traveling. Also, the more people who use it... The better it will get! I think there should be an option for quieter areas to go to, since most places are very touristy and crowded.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
I use it all the time traveling for business or family vacation.

Whether I am taking a Saturday afternoon "cruise" on Texas back roads, or headed cross country, when its time to put the top down and hit the road, TripAdvisor is my companion.  When taking summer time cruises, I enjoy staying at motor court motels. TripAdvisor has been reliable for helping me find clean, friendly establishments. I find most reviews are on target. Because I travel without reservations (I never know where I want to stop until the day progresses) it is nice to have a reliable source to use while on the road.
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 4
Uneasy to use and very helpful
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 3
It's just an ok app.  It can't replace the ease of tripadvisor on my laptop. Tripadvisor is a wonderful website worthy of 5 stars, but this app is only ok.  If I had the choice I would just use the website.

Great app with real reviews and opinions that are important when traveling
Version 6.6 2013-03-17 5
Love trip advisor on the big screen. This app brings the usefulness of the iPhone program to the iPad. Thanks for a good program. Very useful when on the road to find the best places. Thanks to all who take the time to provide reviews. I have offered reviews for years and glad others do as well.

Going back to the website. How unfortunate!

Great app so far. Very user-friendly. Love the option to "save" places to go to. Overall - terrific! Only thing I wish is that I could "favorite" form threads. That would make this app absolutely amazing.

Version 6.6 2013-03-15 4
They need to show B&B , small inns .
Version 6.6 2013-03-15 1
Sort of like TA reviews.   Some are good ( look for reviewers who have posted a lot in the forums and also those who give evidence that they actually travel). Yelp, chow hound, que are much better.  TA is okay on hotels, not so great on restaurants.  Ignore attraction reviews, head for forums ( again, some are good, but....well, if you are relying on TA reviews to plan trips, you might want to supplement with other sites). Regular TA much more usable than app.
Version 6.6 2013-03-15 5
My husband and I travel a great deal.  We started using TripAdvisor two years ago and we look up everything when we are planning a trip.  I can't believe anyone would travel without it!!!

Me parece que han desactivado algunos beneficios de imparcialidad  ejemplo.   Quiero ir a europa y no me da sugerencias de itinerario. Espero que vuelvan a sus raices....
Version 6.6 2013-03-15 4
The App defaults to showing hotels only, you have to figure out how to filter it on the far right of the map to show B&B's also.  It is not clear at first that this is even an option to do.  I would suggest listing all property types in the list first, then allow the user to filter out property types they don't want to see.
Version 6.6 2013-03-15 5

I travel the world drilling oil wells & we frequently travel on numerous vacations. 
I rate my experience using Trip Advisor to be Excellent !!
Would not leave home without it & it is our most frequently used advisor on hotels & restaurants.
Because of Trip Advisor, no longer has it become a Hit or Miss in regards to our adventures.
We read the Reviews & our decisions are based entirely on the Reviews. 
Because of Trip Advisor, we are best able to use hotels which may be a little off the beaten path & not particularly a National Chain & as for restaurants - using Trip Advisor is Superb. Rarely do we receive a poor meal & we are able to coordinate addresses with our GPS to find even remote local only locations.
This is our best used App & we Rate it as Irreplaceable.

Version 6.6 2013-03-09 1
The iPad version has a serious flaw that has been there for a long time. For many locations, especially outside the US, many of the listings for hotels, attractions, etc. simply will not show. In a number of places the top few attractions on the web site listing are not listed on the app. In some locations 2/3 of the listings are missing. 

To use a version with that many omissions would be dumb; almost as dumb as Trip Advisor is for not fixing the problem. 

The iPhone version seems fine, but on the iPad, just use the web site and skip the miserable app.
Version 6.6 2013-03-09 5
Love the search engine and the reviews (though I should read them before I go out more often). I like submitting my honest reviews as I see them and am glad people can take what I have to say and make their own opinion.
I use the site a lot when traveling to search out places to eat and stay and some are spot on and some not. That is why you have to make a personal decision on things.
Version 6.6 2013-03-09 5

Traveling the world by sailboat, the part I love best is getting off of it and onto land to see, do, and eat stuff. Thanks to my TripAdvisor app, I know just what I want to get myself into.

It's intuitive interface makes it easy to use and, like the website, it's collection of thoughtful reviews save me a lot of valuable travel time.

Why by the app instead of just using the website? For me, it just so that I can get to it faster than I could looking for wherever I might have bookmarked it. What would make it even better? An offline version, since one of the things I'm always looking for wherever I go is an Internet connection.
Version 6.6 2013-03-03 5

I use this app every day!  I am either using it to check out restaurants, things to do, hotels or writing a review.  I eat out a lot when traveling and want to be sure I only go to places that have good reviews.  I will try restaurants and things to do that do not have a 5 star rating overall only because not every person's  opinion would be the same as mine.  However, in regards to hotels it must have a 4-5 star rating and must be the most recent.  I highly recommend this app!
Version 6.6 2013-03-02 1
The Trip Advisor iPad app lacks a lot to be desired for me. It's a better experience on your web browser. On the iPad app you can't hide the left side bar which takes up too much room after you find what you are looking for and you can't enlarge the font or stretch the screen on the app either. The browser experience has way too many pop out windows on Trip Advisor web site. 
Other than the listed items we love Trip Advisor, all the customer reviews are great when visiting a place you haven't been before.
5 stars if you make changes to the above listed items.

So I decided to review a restaurant I recently ate at.  I write up the review, rate  the restaurant and hit the "submit" button.  Now I'm told I can't submit my review until I type in my password that I don't have because I didn't register.  Isn't something a little backwards here?  Anyway, I'm sick of registering and using passwords.  I just won't write any reviews.  However, I will continue to read other reviews so I'll grudgingly give this app one star.
Version 6.6 2013-02-18 2
This app is easily my least favorite on my phone. It makes the DMV look responsive.

I LOVE trip advisor, people really collaborate to make it a very useful tool to attempt to remove those bad travel experiences. 

The app is not robust enough. Compare how easy it is to use the yelp app for similar info and you'll see where the TA app needs to go.

TripAdvisor's content is excellent--they've been around forever, and aren't one of the top travel-related websites for nothing. Most of the high marks given to this app seem to reflect this, rather than the app itself. Given their standing, however, I think the app leaves a lot to be desired. It is fairly uninspiring in its presentation of the rich content that TripAdvisor has, is pretty slow, and crashes more than it should. 

Also, a minor comment on the content side: it's not always clear how the rankings of restaurants/hotels are done. For example, "Jungle Junction Family Entertainment" is currently the #1 restaurant in Siem Reap, Cambodia--out of 256 options. Meanwhile, it has 68 reviews, while the #2 restaurant has 519. It seems a bit more thought could be given to this...

Mto bom!!!
Version 6.6 2013-02-16 3
Really love this app. A great help to find attractions and hotels in the place I intend to go. Just wondering why, these 3 days there's "No internet connection" notification everytime I use the app, while I browse on Safari and playing games very smoothly, so I guess no problem with my internet connection. Is there anyone experiencing the same with me? I'm using ipod 4th with ios 6. Thank you:)

Very useful App for travelers. I highly recommend it!
Version 6.6 2013-02-14 1
I much prefer the web page.   Without wanting to struggle through apps I have found my self going to the web page rather than stay with the app.  I like trip advisor enough that I will continue to try and use the app.  I hope it gets as easy to explore with as their explorer version
Version 6.6 2013-02-14 5
Love this app!  I go here first when planning a trip. Never let's me down.
Version 6.6 2013-02-14 5
This is a great app. For traveling on the go.  It gives you a great idea of what you're in for. Very nice to know all about places before you get there.
Version 6.6 2013-02-14 5
I find this App very helpful
Version 6.6 2013-02-14 5
Traveler reviews and rankings from real people are so much more meaningful than any visitors' bureau or news article.  I love being able to search for just about any attraction, hotel, or restaurant and find out what real people thought of it. I use the "Near me" function a lot, even in my home city, just to see what hidden gems might be out there. And for vacation planning, the "Save" star lets me browse around before I go and keep track of the things I really want to do! I wouldn't change a thing about this app.
Version 6.6 2013-02-10 4
Good app with reviews

Version 6.6 2013-02-10 5
This app have great recommendations for restaurants, hotels and must see.
Very informative and easy to use
Version 6.6 2013-02-10 4
Great app for mapping out vacation restaurant options and things to do. I have trusted trip advisor for all my vacations! I find when I'm going through a long list of options, I like to star my favorites. Maybe it's user error but every time I star a favorite, it takes me back to the first page of options...would love for this bug to be fixed to minimize scrolling. For cities that have more than 100 options, it can be time consuming to see the whole list.
Version 6.6 2013-02-10 1
The best part of the stay was having Mario Villavizencio as our Host.  He was there anticipating our every need!  He was very professional and the best asset we found at Royal Solaris!  If you are planning on staying there, do yourself a favor and request Mario before your arrival!  The facility would not be a five star in our opinion, but Mario definately is!
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
Such a great app and easy to use! I use it to plan all my trips.

This app is helping me plan our next vacation to Mexico.. I've been up hours at night reading reviews :)
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
Insightful reviews, intuitive app and all around informative. One of the best travel apps on the market.
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 4
Decent app. Except for the pesky "review reminder" that kept popping up.
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
Use this app on a regular basis.  App works well and the Trip Advisor is a consistently reliable source of good info and reviews.
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
Very easy to use. Have had no problems since downloading. Love it because I'm always looking for places to travel.
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
It does exactly as advertised. I'm a pilot for large U.S. airline and I use this app all the time. It just works!
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 4
Search, reviews, maps, prices, etc.
Just wish the search filters were more comprehensive (filter by price, stars, etc)
Version 6.5 2013-02-09 5
Thanks for helping me every day! I start using tripadvisor since 2012 and because of it , I can make a good living. I work at the Westin Playa Conchal and everyone knows me . They have read about me in tripadvisor. By the way, some people think that these site is not reliable ;  They making a mistake for tripadvisor has zero fake tolerance; so if you are a person who wants a opinion . Download these app and get the truth.
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
I always try to submit something for restaurants, hotels, or other establishments to provide honest and timely information. While I may not agree with others, I feel it is part of making social media successful. Trip Advisor does a great job and reviews are easy to submit.
Version 6.6 2013-02-09 5
I really enjoy using this app to help plan my trips. It's very easy to use. Thank you :)

Easy to use and and always has the best deals
Version 6.6 2013-02-08 4
A lot of times the pictures take a long time to load, other than that, it's a really good app. I'm using wifi and they fail to load or load slow, I use 3G and they load fast, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?
Version 6.6 2013-02-07 5
I like it, is so ease to do it. Good for save good places.

Nice app.
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 5
Love this App. Found some restaurants in my town that I didn't even know about and a couple that I thought had closed but just moved. The Things To Do tab gives some really good ideas for a vacation and also just around where you live. This is one of my go to Apps when planning anything from a trip to a date night to a day out with the family.
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 4
Super util
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 4
The app works very well at home or on the road, anywhere with an Internet connection. IPad is my travel medium and this may be my most used app and easiest to use.
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 5
This is a must-have app for anyone who travels no matter where or how far they go.  Lots of good information.
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 5
This is a great way to find out for locations that we are trying to visit, you can save so many problems reading the  comments!
Version 6.6 2013-01-25 5
Great to have this app for iPad.
Version 6.6 2013-01-24 3
Confused in categories and classification it is not easy to understand why a location with 10 reviews can be better than one with 40 with more excellent reviews. That can be quite misleading . Otherwise the app itself runs well
Version 6.6 2013-01-24 5
The Trip Advisor app is perfect for trip planning!  You can search hotels, restaurants, and things to do; save what you like; and it will plot everything on a map.  Links to websites, photos, reviews, everything you need to make planning a trip easy!

This app is just as good as the website and comes in very handy in app form for your phone
Version 6.6 2013-01-24 5
Just by chance we happened by this darling little place, that had 3 empty tables, 2with reservations. The server was extremely busy with 30 people to serve and did a fabulous job. She recommended the 2specials plus their 2best sellers, we decided one one of the specials and one of the favorites. Again, fabulous ! Then came the dessert crepe, absolutely declious ! Thinking of going back for breakfast.

I use this every where I go.. The only thing is its not always right about hotels
Version 6.6 2013-01-23 3
Please add landscape support for your fat-fingered users!
Version 6.6 2013-01-23 1
Too many clearly fraudulent reviews.  Do some research and discover that tripadvisor does a very poor job of following up on complaints. Impossible to actually speak to a person at TA.
Version 6.6 2013-01-23 5
Love the App. It had critical mass now of users. A must have.
Version 6.6 2013-01-23 5
We use tripadvisor for every vacation. Couldn't do without it
Version 6.1 2013-01-23 5
I like it.  Interesting to read comments to see if the reviewer is on the same page you are.
Version 6.6 2013-01-22 5
If you like Trip Advisor, then you will like the app. Just remember apps do not completely replace full sites.
Version 6.6 2013-01-22 3
Search finds everything regardless of current location.

Excellent app.

I love Trip-advisor, but hate that is forces you to use it in landscape  viewing.  Please give us the option to view in portrait.
Version 6.6 2013-01-22 5
Gives you insight into places, hotels, & restaurant.  I especially like that I can look at reviewers' other reviews to see if their tastes are similar to mine.
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5
Yes I love this app because I like tripadvisor
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5
The best resource for finding a decent place to stay. I have never been sorry for having read the reviews here. You have to be logical when deciding who to believe, so here is my formula:

What is the over-all rating?
What is the opinion of those people who stayed there recently?
What are the complaints?
What do you want from your stay?
How much do you want to spend? 
Is it worth it?

That formula has always worked for me,  and I depend on Trip Advisor anytime I am unfamiliar with a destination and need a place to stay.
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5
Love this app.  Very helpful.
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 4

Love TripAdvisor!
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5
TripAdvisor is the place I start my travel planning long before I make a booking. I can get great ideas from others experiences and the hotel reviews by others give a variety of perspectives which I find helpful.
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5
Love it!  Makes finding things to do and places to stay and eat easy!
Version 6.6 2013-01-21 5

Version 6.6 2013-01-20 5
Great app! :)
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 5
TripAdvisor is probably one of the best apps available for reviewing and searching for things to do around you. I find it amazingly easy to work with and know you will as well.
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 5
Great....really helpful locating places to see and the type of restaurant one desires.
Version 6.6 2013-01-20 4
Good app, but does not include the ability to vote a review as helpful.   Works well otherwise.

Version 6.2 2013-01-18 5
Just Wow! Wonderful app
Version 6.6 2013-01-18 4
TrapAdvisor is my go to app when I want to go somewhere.  Reviews and ratings have assisted me in seeking out places to stay, dine, and visit. Once, a negative review of a cruise made me book that cruise line as the negatives were positives for me.

Pretty good but glitches. Wanted to use flight filters, but it wasn't applying them. Had to start search over. Haven't used it much yet.

This is the best tool on the Internet for checking hotels.  I always check before I stay anywhere. I have written numerous reviews and am frank and truthful about the accommodations  and the tourist attraction.

I am on a Backpacking journey around Asia and I have been using trip advisor / and the offline app for most of the planing and I love every thing about these apps

Trip advisor is the best site and best app I have ever seen, actually its like all-in-one simple as that.
Version 6.6 2013-01-04 5
It is a great application that really helps to find pretty much everything based on the real experience. You can find amazing places , you don't need anything while you are going on vacation but trip-advisor.
Version 6.6 2013-01-04 5
Does what it says it does and what it does is cool.

Love using this for my own cities and surrounding area ... and also of course when traveling.  So simple and helpful!
Version 6.6 2013-01-03 3
Great app, generally easy to use, but why no auto-rotate feature?
Version 6.6 2013-01-03 5
Great app especially if you have cellular Internet where you are, but if you don't, make sure you look everything up before you go out of the hostel/hotel.
Version 6.6 2013-01-03 5
I really like the app mainly because of the reviews. Talking to my friend who owns a couple hotels, trip adviser is the main app they follow for feedback on reviews.
Version 6.6 2013-01-02 3
Seriously? No auto portrait mode when rotating iPad? Bush league.
Version 6.6 2013-01-02 3
In general, this is helpful on the road  BUT.  Just spent 10 minutes reading about a hotel and searching for contact info, which wasn't listed in the app. Nor was there a link to the hotel's website. Finally just found the hotel's website via internet, only to discover I had wasted my time, since the hotel does not allow pets. Why no pet filter?
Version 6.6 2013-01-02 5
Big help to explore a new area

Works well and no problems
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 3
Just started using the app on iPad and seems limited when accessing account information. I'm sure it will improve. Looks great just not completely functional.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
very helpful in trip planning. reading other reviews is crucial for knowing the ins and outs of each destination.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5

Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
We check TripAdvisor before any new vacation for "what to do" & "where to go" ideas.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
Lets you get acquainted with an area
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
The most important thing about tripadviser is the reviews section and I am grateful that there are enough opinions to get an adequate hearing on most things.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 4
Great app. Gave 4/5 because I'm not sure it lists any of the obscure places on top of the typical tourist spots. For example on Billy Connolly's trip across Northern America and Canada he stopped at a place where a guy made celebrity scare crows! It was really creepy, but something different and fun!
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
I love Tripadvisor anyway, and now I have an iPad an app, I love it even more!
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
Trip Advisor is my tool if choice when planning a vacation. The mobile version is a user friendly option for anyone on a smartphone or tablet. The other Trip
advisor users are what makes Trip Advisor work.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 4
Hugely helpful for both planning a trip and on the fly.  I really like the iPad version. Lots of filters and ability to see map or list view.  It's important to me to be able to read the reviews of other customers vice just the hotels' propaganda, and tripadvisor let's me do just that.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 4
I personally think this app is better than the web ver for two reasons; easy to look on the small screen and the simple user interface.
It is definitely not user-hostile, but not quite user friendly sometimes, though.
For example, if I want to find a place to go near where I am, the app picks up several places to choose from.
But it is not clear what leads to this order.
To sort it as users' favor, I need to click the sort and filter button and choose rating.
This was not clear when I boot up for the first time, and left me confused for a while.
Anyways, it is well-built app for some minor interface difficulties.

This may be an end of year thing, but try entering 12/29/2012 in the from date. Earliest to date is in Feb 2013, and won't let you go back. Love the app otherwise...
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
Maybe the best travelers assistant around.
Version 6.6 2012-12-28 5
A must have for all travelers

Great app

This app is one of a kind and is super helpful where ever you go.
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 5
Good app reviewing many flight and hotels easy to find the best deals
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 2
I would have expected to have the same functionality as the website, but that's not the case.
- the filters available on the website are not in the app.
  - unable to search based on amenities such as wifi, washer/ dryer, tv, etc..
- unable to filter for apartments/condos
- doesn't display price.  Need to get rates by going to Expedia or other websites.
- the majority if the findings do not have the option to save to "my trips"

The two distinctive features I did find useful we're 1) your "saves"
are displayed on the map 2) the interface is user friendly.

Overall, the website is the better choice than this app.
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 5
This is a must read site before booking any trips. It is always nice to get other people's perspective on what places are like before booking. We use it often before booking hotels we haven't stayed at before .
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 5
Fast and relevant !
Version 6.6 2012-12-27 5
Can't go anywhere without checking in!

Love this app and service-- great review!
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Dear Trip Advisor and all the folks who take the time to tell their stories. You are my eyes and my virtual experience. For new people, here's my strategy. Start with most recent reviews and read many of these. Look for similar comments, especially the bad ones. Then go straight to the worst ones and make sure you take note of the date!  Properties can change drastically when management changes even with chains. Keep your mind open to people with isolated personal faults. Look for similarities. Bugs, bad matresses, cleanliness, etc. Usually the odd ones are personal gripes with hotel staff or cranky family issues!  It's great when the hotel staff/manager responds. So, keep the communication open, my friends!  Happy and safe travel to all!
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Greatest trip app ever.   I have used it for years and years.  It always hits the mark as far as correct information goes.   We use it for International travel as well as stateside.   Trip Adviser steered us to the Casablanca hotel in N.Y. City.  We stay there whenever we go to the city.   Actually, from B&B's in Sonama to Hawaii to San Fran. We take this app every where we go.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Used tripadvisor app for the first time while planning my last trip. Incredible. Trip was perfect. So easy to use. Better than the website in my opinion.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
The reviews with this app for dining and accommodations are spot on!  No surprises, like what you get in reviews in "Yelp".  If the review is good, you can rely on it.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Have been using this app I think for about 6 months now & it has performed very well. No problems whatsoever. I'd pay for it if it wasn't free!! Love it!!
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Very helpful. First time visiting the area. Thanks!
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Wouldn't change a thing!

I love the ability the app has to save things you are interested in and organize a whole trip. Really easy to use and a great resource to have.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
One of the best Apps I've used irrespective of purpose.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Trip advisor has been the most helpful source of travel info as I've planned trips in different parts of the world. Glad I have the iPhone app now!
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 4
been using this on travels, and find it to be of great help.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 3
Would be five stars except that there is no portrait mode on the iPad!  Very silly to be forced into landscape mode for the forums.  You can only see a few entries at a time.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
I travel all the time and always rely on TA for reviews. Kudos to the iPad App version.
Version 6.6 2012-12-26 5
Don't leave home without it!
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 5

Excellent. Best food and so much fun
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 5
Easy to use and very international
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 4
I have come to really rely on the service, and having the app at my fingertips is very ha dy.  The app is well done, and provides a quick review of locations while it is still fresh on your mind.

One addition that would be nice is to be able to geolocate the establishment while you are there so you could review it without looking it up
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 5
This is my most trusted and used app when planning for a trip or vacation!
Version 6.5 2012-12-25 5
Great app. Great information
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 3
I love Tripadvisor on the web and just recently loaded the iPad app. It's OK but I miss the website. For one thing, I don't see where on the app you can mark a review as "helpful," which is a nice aspect of the website and, as a reviewer myself, a much appreciated aspect of the process. In addition, you cannot see a reviewer's profile. Also, the process for putting items in your saved file can be a bit clumsy and misleading. If you add an item your saved file sometimes tells you there are only 2 items in your file when in reality you might have 10. In order to see your complete folder you have to access it from the bar at the top of the page instead of in the list for the city you're already in.   This could be a great app if this stuff were fixed.
Version 6.6 2012-12-25 5

Version 6.6 2012-12-24 5
Does exactly as intended. Consistently provides better prices than orbitz.
Version 6.6 2012-12-24 4
Great for planning a great vacation. I am a little frustrated sometimes when I know of a certain attraction but I can't find it.
Version 6.6 2012-12-24 5
This is a great app, I met a girl and went on a date I'm the next town where she lives and used the app to find the best places to eat and to grab some coffee after.
Version 6.6 2012-12-23 5
I now use TA for everything they offer.  The continuing accrual of information is phenomenal.
Version 6.6 2012-12-23 5
Great app best trip app around
Version 6.6 2012-12-23 3
I don't understand why this app keeps switching location on me when I scroll through the next set of search results.  Very annoying, but I do like that it gives me results.
Version 6.6 2012-12-23 5
We would not travel without it.  We use it all the time to check out accommodations, restaurants and things to see and do.
Version 6.6 2012-12-23 5

Version 6.6 2012-12-11 1
I love the iPhone app but on the iPad there's hardly any of the depth of info - I looked for restaurants near my resturant- heavy neighborhood but the nearest one the iPad app located was 5 miles away - on the iPhone, it's on the corner...
Version 6.6 2012-12-11 5
Easy to use and full of useful information. I LOVE being able to read reviews quickly and easily when choosing a hotel. Will be my new go-to app when traveling.

Great app to see what others are saying about places you want to visit.  You can change reservations or be aware of where you want to avoid. My wife and I are keeping tracking of. Our vacation spot and found that we need to rent a car because of how remote the hotel is to the food.
Version 6.6 2012-12-08 5

Version 6.6 2012-12-08 5
Great reviews of places to travel. Also has maps, contact info, booking info, and even photos of the places to visit! This app allows many ways for the traveler to give useful data for the future traveler. Nicely done. Hasn't crashed yet; that's good too!

Great when visiting a new city

There seem to be many problems with this app. Sloppily assembled and a number of glitches that crash the iPad. Can't book rooms because the calendar doesn't let you move back.  Additional problems with the app being glitchy and crashing.
Version 6.6 2012-12-07 5
I always read reviews of places/hotels/activities before booking anything. It always helps in making decisions where to stay, what to do and what to expect. While reviews are different from one person to another and depends on experience also, Tripadvisor is still my go to app/site. Very useful for travelers.
Version 6.6 2012-12-07 5
Great app
Version 6.6 2012-12-07 1
I live in an area in L.A. and I used this area where I lived (and knew) as a test.  It totally missed three of the closest/better and largest restaurants, but DID show all the town choke-and-pukes (and the other nicest and larger restaurants have been here longer)! 
FAILED.
**Delete for L.A area**. Not sure for other places.

What a wonderful app to have, helped me with my vacation in late 2012. A must have when you are out of your comfort zone.
Version 6.6 2012-12-05 5
Being new in a city one would love to have a personal guide resource that works out everything from landmarks, to hotels and where to find food. Tripadvisor just cuts it for me.
Version 6.6 2012-12-05 5
I love it. Don't go anywhere with out looking here first.
Version 6.6 2012-12-05 3
I must be missing something because I find this app frustrating. One of the great things about tripadvisor is it ranks things, yet when you look for say a place to eat in the app it seemingly lists things in random order. The list might start with a restaurant that is #250. Then it does not let me add more businesses to my list, so I am stuck with all badly ranked listings.
Version 6.6 2012-12-05 5
Love things to do list the most.
Version 6.6 2012-12-04 4
I think this is the best place you can find for your stay in Kathmandu.  The Hotel sill has the Tea House Nepali charm 
along with the modern conveniences we want in a city hotel.  The Garden is one of the biggest draws to the Hotel.  The tables sit under bi, beautiful shade trees where you can enjoy all meals.

The Staff truly makes this a home away from home.  Everyone, from the desk manager, "Bijay," always helpful with that Nepali joy and welcome smile to the waiters and room cleaners make your stay an experience where you'll not want to leave.  All of the staff do their best to fulfill any requests pleasantly and helpfully.
Version 6.6 2012-12-04 5
I've been using this app to research for an upcoming trip in Belize and it has helped a ton. I plan on also using it once I get there to find restaurants and stuff to do.
Version 6.6 2012-12-03 5
On every trip, whether it be for business or pleasure, I will always consult trip advisor for areas to sightsee, restaurants to eat at and places to go! I trust the opinions of fellow travelers (some more than others!) and on occasion will go out of my way to judge some of those borderline places that get the most reviews! Love the app!!!
Version 6.6 2012-12-03 4
App is really helpful when my creativity for something to do is tapped!
Version 6.6 2012-12-03 5
Gooooood
Version 6.6 2012-12-03 3
I try and rate these places I go to, nobody has rated them yet, so the app won't let me rate them either.  That's pretty dumb.

Other than previous problem, app is pretty good.

Take the ratings with a grain of salt, some people rate everyplace like it is the Ritz.  If the cost is $25US for a room for the night, it isn't five stars and shouldn't be compared to a five star hotel.  Most of the raters have completely unrealistic standards and should be ashamed of themselves for treating small businesses so poorly when all they are trying to do is provide
Decent service at a small fee.  Rate the business based on cost and location.
Version 6.6 2012-12-03 5
Amazing and helpful!
Version 6.6 2012-12-02 4
Perfect app for a road trip where you have no idea where anything is. Also a great tool for finding new spots where you live.

As a reviewer this app is terrible to write reviews on the go. Plus there's not an option to add photos with the review. Tripadvisor needs to step up their game and update this.

This application is not functioning properly with the iPad after multiple attempts.  It continually bumps me from my current location to a generic world location.

I've found this app to be helpful with decent advice and reliable information.
Version 6.6 2012-11-18 4
I use it daily to check places and see what other people have to say so I'm happy with it . It's not like Yelp and you can't "Check In" @ places and they don't have a lot of the places as of yet but I'm sure it will grow in time.

Nice app for when you're on the go.  But there is very limited access to your own profile and prior reviews.  If you mistype or forget to upload a picture with your review you can't get back to it from the iPad app.  But for routine searching it works very well.  TripAdvisor should upgrade this app to give it the full functionality of the website.

your search result is not retained after navigating a selection. 
switching between tabs sometime takes longer than usual.
descriptions of place can't hardly be seen. 

overall, not great experience
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 4
I absolutely love this app. It's easy to navigate, easy to view destinations, save destinations, look at reviews but there really needs to be an option for members to view the reviews they've posted just like on the main site. If tripadvisor app had that option I'd gladly give it a 5 star rating!
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 5
You can learn a lot of things before traveling with this app also when you are in a new city you can discover many things and read  people experience about these areas that you want to go so that helps :)
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 2
You can't search for cabins here.  is too far of website.  need update for this feature
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 5
I use Trip Advisor frequently.  I travel for business constantly and rely on Trip Advisor for local restaurant recommendations. I use this more than another online service and find it is generally very accurate. Count on it!
Version 6.6 2012-11-14 5
Really easy to use and great presentation of maps, reviews and more. Sooooo much better than using a web browser.
Version 6.6 2012-11-13 5
I travel for work almost every week & TripAdvisor never disappoints. Whether you are traveling to major cities or Dodge City, KS, you can find valuable info for hotels & restaurants. An absolute must for travel!

iPad app doesn't list some restaurants, etc. that are on the iPhone app. What?
Version 6.6 2012-11-10 2
Really like TripAdvisor's content, but really dislike this app on iPad.  Scrolling is slow and it loses track of your taps.  Feels like a web page rather than an app.
Version 6.6 2012-11-10 3
I am a huge Trip Advisor fan, but I'm disappointed with this app.  I often find I have to go to the traditional website to get accurate results.  The app may only show one  result when the same query in the traditional site shows many.  The mobile app map is glitchy. I hope the developer keeps working on it.
Version 6.6 2012-11-10 1

Trip advisor web site is great -- but it's app dose not work with my iPhone 4.  I've installed it 3 times -- it works up until the "find" button is tapped -- then nothing happens.
Version 6.6 2012-11-07 5
I use a lot of travel apps but trip advisor is the first one I go to.
Version 6.6 2012-11-07 5
I think this mobile app is faster and easier to use than the full website version. Yes it is missing some of the search filters and extra tabs, but for what I use Trip Advisor for, reviews, pics, location, and quick prices, those are the main features on this app. It's a time saver.
Version 6.6 2012-11-07 1
Trip advisor is indispensable for trip planning. Yet trip after trip when I'm trying to use the app on the road it's unusable. The map feature locks up every time.  When looking for restaurants and reading reviews and trying to locate on the map, it's unable to switch back and forth. Total lock up. I had this problem when I travelled a few months ago and can't believe it hasn't been fixed. Here I am traveling again and the app is useless. I'm switching to Yelp. Adios trip advisor. Do yourself a favor and DON'T leave on a trip counting on this app to help you on the road.

Version 6.6 2012-10-27 4
Only 2 problems I've noticed:

1. Translation option on the chrome browser is sorely missed for figuring out what the locals have to say.

2. Editing your profile... I can't figure out how to do that just yet on the app.

Otherwise it's pretty helpful.

So which is it: You want me to use my Facebook credentials to create my TripAdvisor account so you can advertise in my timeline, or you simply don't have a create account process that works reliably????

Either way, I have never had so much difficulty with the sign up process on an app. I simply wanted to rate a company with whom I had a wonderfully positive experience and Trip Advisor ruined that!!!!!

Shame on you!

Crap App!

I would have thought TA could come up with a worthwhile app, but I find this app very frustrating to use. So much so, I deleted it. I much prefer the website for researching destinations. The app doesn't seem to find things that the website searches do, plus you can't track your account activity. It may work for local gps searches, but as a trip research tool on the iPad, I will stick with the TA website.
Version 6.6 2012-10-22 4
Fine mostly, but there's no way to tell a reviewer that his/her review was helpful in the iPad app. I had to go to the site using Safari to do that.

Version 6.6 2012-10-22 2
This is a pretty good ap as long as you don't make the mistake of believing what you read and reserve a room through Trip Advisor's parent company, Hotels.com.  Folks, just get the telephone number from the hotel website and call the hotel direct. You will almost always get a substantially LOWER price.  

Now I see several more things that are now included in this ap that are beginning to defeat its purpose. The first is that inn owners can rebut the complaints of the reviewers, basically enabling the owners to call their customers liars. If you look through the reviews in any part of the country, you will see that this is going on. But that's not the most serious problem.  There is strong evidence that the so called top rated lodgings are asking their friends to submit bogus reviews that highly inflate the quality of their product, the object of which is to get so many good reviews that the establishment goes to the top of the ratings chart for that particular part of the country. For example, I know several of the bed and breakfast establishments in a town in Nova Scotia and one of the top three is clearly not of the caliber espoused by the so called reviewers. The owner of the establishment is using his spectacular Trip Advisor reviews as a major feature of his web page so he can gain a competitive advantage over his local competitors. How does Trip advisor audit the books to be sure these customers actually stayed there?  

There is no doubt in my mind that the owner of this place in Nova Scotia is writing the reviews himself and asking his friends from his former international work environment to send them in pretending that have stayed there. It doesn't take a genius to detect repetitive writing style, word usage, syntax and content in reviews that are supposedly written by different people from all over the world. There are no safeguards in this ap to protect customers from this sort of industry behavior. I wonder if reviewers are even informed that a bad business can grossly exaggerate its positive attributes and then categorically deny everything a reviewer writes and make the customer look like he's the one with a hidden agenda or a dishonest motive.

The other downside to this ap is that Trip Advisor edits or deletes reviews they don't like so that the ap is really a puff piece for the businesses rather than a service to customers. And, if I am correct, none of you will ever see this review of Trip Advisor either. The last time I complained about the inflation of pricing through Hotel.com, they refused to print the the review. 

I suggest you use Yelp. It's the real thing and exists to help customers make choices and book their rooms and reservations themselves. I believe the reviews on Yelp but not this misleading hotel booking gambit.

The IPAD version of Trip Advisor is unparalleled in the Ether.  Ratings are consistently reliable with bad reviews an insignificant  factor.  Trip Advisor's are by and large--literate and reliable in their reviews. Most who say that food or service is bad...have a valid reason that is worthy of reading.  Flamers and disgruntled raters with an ax to grind....are rare.  Highly recommended by this family.

I must at least disclose up front that my experience using this app is somewhat limited, but that is because it provided limited results. I began my search for a beautiful location here in my home state of Arizona. I saw pictures and wanted to find out where it was and so googled it. I got the link to the trip advisor spot and so clicked to it. It asked if I'd like the app, and so I installed it. While the website had numerous reviews of the exact spot, I never could find it on the app. The best I could do is find the BLM wilderness area in which it sits. If I didn't already know about it, I'd never find it.

I'm guessing the app is just fine for finding the most popular big name. Attractions, as well as hotels and restaurants (though I am guessing here as I haven't tried anything wierd in those categories). But t won't help you find the off the beaten track places.

We have been big fans of tripadvisor ever since we returned from a vacation, discovered tripadvisor, looked up the hotel we had just visited, and found that the reviews described the place perfectly!

We have used it for everything from 10 day international vacations down to reviews of a local pub and have not been disappointed.
Version 6.6 2012-10-14 5
Great app for looking at hotels and finding restaurants. I love it !!!
Version 6.6 2012-10-14 5
I think trip adviser is one of the best apps I've ever put on my telephone. I would recommend for anybody who travels to use this app on your telephone at work so great and it'll tell you real opinions of what people think of the hotels which is well worth to read it. If you travel a lot this is a great app for you!!
Version 6.6 2012-10-14 3
The app is too laggy to have any benefit over the website- I find I double click b/c the first click doesn't seem to register, only then skip a page.
Version 6.6 2012-10-14 3
I want to like this app, since I use the website constantly, but the Save function only works sporadically. Is the app passive-aggressively telling me I shouldn't go to that particular restaurant? I don't know, but the random lack of ability to save a place is annoying as all #%&! The second bug is with Saved Trips. In list view, it shows Ft. Worth (16) for instance (my aunt lives there, we visit a lot. Don't judge.) So it knows I have 16 items saved in that list. But when I go into view them in detail, now it shows 0. And finally, a the newest bug, the one that prompted me to finally write a review... The back button caused the entire UI to fall apart. Pieces misaligned, background didn't load, completely jumbled and unusable. Was using TA on an iPad2 in iOS 5 & 6.
Version 6.6 2012-10-14 5

Using iPad, authorized Trip Advisor to use my current location.  It made nothing of it. Typed in my specific address.  It couldn't find what part of the planet I was on. Typed in current city - but what is the use of that? What am I to make of >2000 restaurant reviews scattered all over Barcelona?

My husband and I, with another couple, stopped at the Gondola Cafe in Corfu, Greece because they stated they had free wifi with a beverage purchase.

Great site for searching for all aspects of travel and keeping it organized.  Just started using today, so I am no pro, but it throws me off when I move the map and all of the info changes.  Also I wish they had a place for notes on each save to compare personal preferences at a glance when choosing a hotel...(has indoor pool, great view,etc.)

Easy to use and convenient
Version 6.6 2012-10-12 5
Great app... Love it!
Version 6.6 2012-10-12 5
100%
Version 6.6 2012-10-11 5
Haven't been unhappily surprised or disappointed yet.
Version 6.6 2012-10-11 5
Always use this app b4 going somewhere!
Version 6.6 2012-10-11 4
I still like Yelp, but trip advisor is more comprehensive, especially outside the US.
Version 6.6 2012-10-11 5
Trip Advisor helps you organize your trip and decide what's best for your needs. A must
Version 6.4 2012-10-11 5
Great tool for traveling.
Version 6.6 2012-10-11 4
My reviews always post and stay posted unlike yelp where they remove legitimate reviews and call it "filtering"
Version 6.6 2012-10-11 1
I am searching for "Things to do" for San Francisco and Alcatraz did not show up in the first 30. Only private companies...
Version 6.6 2012-10-10 2
Gives good rating but continues to give me airline reservations for 2 passengers. I have gone back and reset the search 3-4 times and had to just say forget it. However, rates were very good.
Version 6.6 2012-10-10 5
I did try it in my trip in Istanbul, it was unbelievable it sometime looks like you don't need to meet or asking any one more cuz of this app it's really full app
Version 6.6 2012-10-10 2
It took me about 10 mins to figure out how to go back, as I assumed the back button was for the left column. The app doesn't save searches, or persist where I was last time. I also can't get to the zoom level I want on the map. Performance is not great on my gen 3 iPad. I can't view a long enough list of hotel results, because I can't hide the map. Please switch to native maps and use more standard navigation patterns so this app is easier to use.
Version 6.6 2012-10-10 5
App is great.  Ever friendly.  I often consult this app first when I am traveling for recommendations.  Always submit reviews because I so appreciate others reviews.  Non biased opinions are greatly appreciated.
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
This App is literally the idiot's guide to travel and everything else related. Describing it as "user-friendly" wouldn't do it nearly amount of justice deserved.
Version 6.5 2012-10-09 5
This app has become a primary tool for me to use when researching my travel plans.
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 2
I used to love this app as I could use it to find a hotel or restauraunt when traveling and then track over to there using their gps location blip on the screen. This no longer works and in fact never updates once you've performed a search. I loved this part of the app as I could search for a hotel and see its location relative to mine as I was still moving. Now it is much more difficult to find my bearings and I find I am much less able to use the app. Please go back!
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
Amazing site!!! Everything I could have wanted.  Shows way more pictures on this app than on the actual site
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 1
Bing maps??? O_o
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
very good app
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
Much better, people here write thoughtful responses, and it isn't subject to fudging like Yelp is
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
Great!
Version 6.6 2012-10-09 5
Great source of information, all in one place. We now rely on TA rather than the usual myriad of assorted apps for locating hotels and restaurants. 

My biggest complaint is I can't find a way to see all my past reviews in one location. The profile appears to be chiseled in stone once you've created it. An additional tab giving you access to your profile and past reviews would be helpful. If such access already exists, it's buried where I couldn't find it.
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 5
Very simple, complete and accurate.
Best application (better than Kayak!).
Abuse it!
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 5
Excellent app
Version 6.3 2012-10-07 3
It's ok
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 5
We always check trip advisor before booking hotels. Highly recommended!
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 4
I like it all things considered.
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 1
They added the ability to save items to your "favorite" list, which would be great if it didn't take you back to the start of browsing search results every time.  The web site itself has gone downhill, and it seems the app just gets worse too. Do the people that write and maintain the tripadvisor site/app just never bother to actually test anything before the commit the changes?

The app crashes, is painfully slow if you aren't on a super high speed connection and is worthless if you don't have a reliable Internet connection. You are almost better served by using safari and google to search tripadvisor content then to bother with this app or the site itself.
Version 6.6 2012-10-07 5
Just what the doctor ordered!
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 5
It's my first stop to check out hotels in a new city.
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 5
Love tripadvisor so this makes it easy to use on the go!
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 5
I use this app to get other people's opinions on motels we might stay in, and it's very helpful and easy to use.
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 5
We're new in SD and having using this app for everything. All places we've gone have been excellent! Really satisfied!
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 5
The trip Advisor is a Very important tool for travelers!!! Very nice and easy to toy!
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 1
Pretty Please?
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 1
The fares are BS. This app offers 400.00 and the checkout comes to 795.00?
Version 6.6 2012-10-06 5
I always read the reviews on trip advisor and find them to be real life, real world reviews. That's what I like the best -- no paid writers here; just honest, informative, and indispensable facts for any traveller!
Version 6.6 2012-10-05 3
I have used Trip Advisor app for several years, and find the latest version more user unfriendly than the previous versions.  It sometimes fails to draw the map  when going to see where points of interest are located.  it also fails to respond to user selections, ignoring my selections.  Most annoying, however, is that it only does searches based on exact matches, which made it very hard for me to get the information I needed when i only knew part of the information.
Version 6.6 2012-10-05 5
I enjoy giving my impressions of restaurants and hotels.i try to be honest about the good and bad points, because everyone has his/her own selling points. When choosing hotels etc on out of town trips I ALWAYS check other people's reviews! Valuable tool for sure! :-)
Version 6.6 2012-10-05 5
Does everything it needs to, well done
Version 6.6 2012-10-05 5
I've used this app for the last couple of trips I've planned. I save my potential things to do and restaurants as well as my hotel. It's great to be able to see where things are related to the hotel before arriving. Plus the reviews are great in helping me make decisions. Love it!
Version 6.6 2012-10-05 5
Use it on my trip to Europe and was wounderful
Version 6.4 2012-10-05 5
Great app for searching places to stay and eat.
Version 6.6 2012-10-04 5
We have used this app for everything when we travel. Almost 5 years now and it hasn't let us down 1 time! 

Thanks a bunch!
Version 6.6 2012-10-04 5
This is a handy app for traveling. Easy to use and functional. Have not had any tech issues with it.
Version 6.6 2012-10-04 3
Please make this app faster than that
Version 6.6 2012-10-04 5
Easy to use, accurate info, wide range of businesses. I use this app even to choose businesses in my own city.
Version 6.4 2012-09-27 5
We count on trip advisor and have never been led astray. Primarily use for restaurants when on the road. Get this app!
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 4
I found Trip Advisor quite helpful in locating hotels and area attractions.
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 4
I used trip advisor to help review and choose hotels and activities on our recent European vacation. It was a very helpful tool. The app is a bit clunky, but the information was great.
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 2
Have seen better. Graphics are amateur and the app runs way too slowly. Information is often inaccurate and software is buggy. No good.
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 5
Great app with no issues so far. Very comprehensive
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 5
Very straight forward. A++

Very good information, and very well laid out. Very awesome. Thanks!!!
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 5
I have used trip advisor for our trips to Italy, Greece, Puerto Rico...hasn't failed me yet!
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 5
This is something you just need. Treat it like Olympic ice skating. Throw outthe high & the low. Even if you really "know" a chain, you may be surprised. I'm  TA and this is one of my go to apps
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 5
Addicted, totally.
Version 6.5 2012-09-27 5
Very dependable and useful app. The negative reviews are as interesting as the positive ones. Some people it seems are unhappy about the most insignificant things.... like shampoo in a plastic bottle that is hard to squeeze out!  The positive reviews are " right on" for us and have helped a great deal in our domestic and European travels. You have earned your stars!
Version 6.5 2012-09-26 5
This place is awesome! The owners are great and the whole place is so relaxing and so scenic. There is so much to do also. Defiantly recommend!!!
Version 6.5 2012-09-26 5

Very helpful. Great way to research an area before going there and even while you're there. Easy to use and nice on iPhone
Version 6.5 2012-09-26 5
Very useful tool to help advise you to a local location where the most people go to everyday.
Version 6.5 2012-09-26 5
What did I do without this app?  It's great!  I trust reviews that I read on Trip Advisor!  I leave reviews for every place I go!
Version 6.2 2012-09-26 5
I use it all the time to decide where to eat or stay! It has generally been spot on.  Thank you trip advisor.

Works well & quite helpful mobile version but prefer web version better. Web version seems easier to use.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
Hardly go to eat anywhere out of town without checking trip advisor. Usually correct
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 1
Very disappointing software, it is slow, it is buggy, some buttons, like the ones used to select and unselect favorite options do jot function at times...
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 4
Great app to plan a trip or just for spontaneous ideas!
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 1
Not intuitive, tried searching for "little brick house" restaurant in cedar city Utah, brings up results in england.  ???
Why doesn't it search where I am?
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
Just like the web version. Highly recommend.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
This app saved me from staying in a horrible hotel during a trip to New Orleans.  Thanks to everyone that has posted pictures and reviews!
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 2
This app has nice information and works for hotels. But you can't switch from viewing hotels to viewing Things To Do without the app changing the city all of a sudden. The Things to Do suddenly disappear. Not helpful at all.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
Just has to be the greatest  service!
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
I use this and yelp when I go to places That is new, so helpful in many ways more than one.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 5
This application is the best one.thanks.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 4
Use it all the time.  Never disappointed.
Version 6.5 2012-09-22 1
You have a pop-up add IN the app telling me to download your app? That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 5
La aplicacion esta brutal e encanta!!!!
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 1
This app crashes a lot on my iPad 3 running iOS 6. Very aggravating! 
Also, no access to my own acct and reviews!?!? You can't be serious!
I think it would better to use Safari so that you can access all the features of this site!
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 5
You must have this APP if you're traveling, or use the website. It will save you hours of looking and the misery of bad places and things to do.
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 5
Makes it easy to find restaurants, write reviews and just a generally useful app. Great when traveling!
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 5
Great to find a travel app with up to date reviews.  Especially like the nearby feature for planning a day.
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 2
Trip Advisor continually freezes up on my i-Pad..so I disengage and go to Hotel and Yelp...am returning less and less..too unreliable...dysfunctional...too bad because I actually find the app useful and easy to navigate.
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 5
This app is truly a must have if you're planning a trip. The reviews and the pictures are great and always up to date
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 5
I love it...
Version 6.5 2012-09-21 3
This is just fine for travel research but I would like to see more member features.  There's no place to see reviews that you've done or check feedback.
Version 6.5 2012-09-20 5
I'm giving this max ratings because they added the add review function.
Version 6.5 2012-09-20 5
This app is a huge help in planning big trips and spontaneous adventures alike. A must have for any traveler.
Version 6.5 2012-09-20 5

Version 6.5 2012-09-20 1
I don't get why u don't have Turkish cuisine ?
Version 6.5 2012-09-20 5

Really awesome for traveling !
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 4
I have always loved trip advisor!  I recommend it whenever someone is traveling.  
It's nice for me to have it portable now since I have always had a desktop computer and I am old fashioned and still have a dumb phone!LOL  The only thing that I find frustrating is that many sites use adobe flash and my IPad isn't compatible?  I guess?  This is my first attempt at an apple product so I'm still learning.  So my frustration isn't with trip advisor, but with my IPad.  Trip advisor rocks have used it for years!  Its saved me from wasting money at lame destinations and helped me find the small out of the way spots that are exactly what I was looking for.
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 5
This is a great App. I visit other sites and they are not as accurate as this App Trip adviser. I love it and would recommend  to anyone at anytime.
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 5
This app is very practical and you don't need to search anywhere else, because it will do it for you! 
Don't miss it!
Version 6.5 2012-09-19 4

Version 6.4 2012-09-18 5
You can easily get overwhelmed with planning a trip. The trip adviser app is very user-friendly.  It always helps me to sort different activities based on reviews and assist with planning expectations, and wonderful experiences on my trips!
Version 6.2 2012-09-18 5
Looks great so far.
Version 6.5 2012-09-18 5

Version 6.4 2012-09-16 5
I love this app!
Version 6.5 2012-09-16 3
Being a frequent traveler, I have always relied on tripadvisor to pick the hotels and restaurants that best cater to my needs.
I totally believe that the best food and hotel critics are the average customers such as myself who take the time to share their experiences so that others can benefit from them.
As for the app, I think that it needs a lot of improvements as it lags, crashes, and is frequently non-responsive.
Version 6.5 2012-09-16 4
Very solid.
Version 6.5 2012-09-16 5
Super app all your travel need in one place. Airlines, Hotels and Restaurants. Excellent reviews on Restaurants.

Has info on every restaurant and hotel I've ever inquired about. I like the personal takes of the wide variety of reviewers. This app has pointed me in the right direction many times and has saved me many unpleasantries. When I ignored it's advice at a restaurant in Macon GA, BOY WAS I SORRY!  It was like dining on vinegar. Obey your fellow reviewers. :)

Since I updated the app won't open on my iPad 2, just spins and spins (or immediately crashes). Deleted and reinstalled, same thing. Oh well, the web site is better anyway.

What can I say but Hooray!  Put effort into the site because I've always been happy with what I've read.

A well thought out app! Useful and easy to navigate! Love this app!
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 4
A wonderful travel companion
Version 6.4 2012-09-14 4
Helped me find top rated hotels and food fast and got me in the right direction. My #1 trip go to app. Didn't give it a 5 cause some of the pics were missing, but I assumed the places were not good. I like this app a lot.
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 1
Downloaded most recent update.  App crashes before opening.  Deleted the app and reloaded it, but there is no change.
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 5
This app is an invaluable resource. It really has helped us to get more out of trips and even around home! Highly recommended.
Version 6.4 2012-09-14 5
App makes it so convenient to find hotels and restaurants.  Easy to use.
Version 6.2 2012-09-14 5
Find anywhere you want to go. User reviews are great and informative.
Version 6.5 2012-09-14 2
Love Trip Advisor, but this app definitely lacks substance. For example, cannot search on vacation rentals or access my personal account details (except for "saved" hotels).  Also had app crash several times during navigation. Hope to see improvements in future releases, but for now it is truly a bare bones version of the full site.
Version 6.5 2012-09-13 4
Trip Advisor is very helpful to research local restaurants, and is an invaluable tool when out of town. I have used it many times and find others reviews, while sometimes very different, very helpful.
Version 6.5 2012-09-13 5
Great app. I use it all the time before I go on a vacation. I love the fact that I get to read what other travelers have to say about their experiences. Must download.
Version 6.5 2012-09-13 5
My friend introduced me to the site and come to find out there is an amazing app. So easy and helpful to use, wouldn't think of using anything else!
Version 6.5 2012-09-13 5
Having a site that rates hotels for you as you travel. Saving the trouble of having to search around on the web for hotels on the area. I like you can post reviews as well. There's something great about being able to warn people about crappy hotels and praising others.
Version 6.5 2012-09-13 5
Love this app! Great resource To have while traveling!
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 5
Just downloaded it a few days ago it's really cool, to find new places to eat and to have people's comments on them places.
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 5
The app is very good. Just cant wait till more ppl are on board so that theres more places more feedback.
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 5
Great app for anyone traveling, where to stay, what to eat, what to do, all you need in one stop. All with reviews from people who have experienced all.
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 5
Decided to get this app on my iPhone and iPad and it is a must for trip planning, travel snafus, hotel and restaurant recommendations and ratings, especially since we travel by car and change our minds often!
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 5
I love trip advisor as it provides all the needs for any trip I plan. It is my go to app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 1
Tried to check the listings for San Miguel Allende, Mexico.
The app got stuck and couldn't display the restaurants and hotels on the list
Not much good.
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 4
Unfortunately I haven't quite how to weed out the dreck written by hotel/restaurant staffers.
Overall a useful tool, but helps sometimes to get a 2nd opinion.

Version 6.4 2012-09-13 5
Used it during my vacation or business trip. Very helpful
Version 6.4 2012-09-13 4
A must for road warriors
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
Another one of those apps that I couldn't live without when traveling! It relies on audience participation. So if you read it, make sure you post too!
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 4
TripAdvisor has so much great information for the business traveller and vacationer, should be a 'must-have' app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
A must to insure a good travel adventure.
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
Great app! We have found a lot of great restaurants using this while traveling! Love it!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 4
Very handy
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
I rely on the information travelers post here. I use this app on my iPod touch and I use the web site. Love both!
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 4
You can learn a great deal about where you plan to go from others reviews.   This gave us great tours, good ideas, and made our travel experience better. Travel is still an adventure, but the extra help makes the adventure more fun. The app helps you navigate this on the go. Especially helpful when you are enroute or in your adventure.
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 4
This app let's you do everything same as the website, except edit your profile, which I wish you could do.
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
Check Trip Advisor first!
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
True lifesaver when planning dates!
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 5
When I travel I have come to rely on reviews from Trip Advisor whether it is restaurants or lodging. I don't know how I traveled before without the great information.
Version 6.4 2012-09-12 4
App excelente, recomendo
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
Wouldn't plan or travel without it!
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
The interface on the iPad app is a lot better than the website.
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 4
Great app, I just bought my iPad and downloaded the TripAdvisor app. So far I like the app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 1
Love the website but the app on the iPad does not work properly.  You find a place, ex Bunaken Islands it gives you three hotels. If you edit the filter to include other type of facilities it jumps to... Italy! Not very useful
Version 6.3 2012-09-11 5
We use TA primarily for restaurants, when we travel, which is frequently.  We are able to find great restaurants so it is easier to make good selections.
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
It delivers what it promises!
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
I use this app whenever I plan my trips. It's been so helpful, I couldn't go without it. Thx TripAdvisor!
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5

Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
Much easier to use than the website on a browser. I highly recommend this app!
Version 6.4 2012-09-11 5
Very functional app. Has the basics you need and works smoothly on iPhone.
Version 6.4 2012-09-10 5
I love this App. It really has helped me during my travel's. One of the best travel apps ever!
Version 6.4 2012-09-10 2
TA seems to have great potential but has only been a little helpful. Used it while in Japan and was able to find some stuff but "ALL" the distances were wrong and in miles but Japan is in kilometers. Also there were over 15 places to eat in a 7 mile radius but TA said the closest please was 12 miles away. There should be an option to change between metric or us systems and an option to add a place that is not in TA. On the good side of things most of the places in TA had many pictures and reviews and I was able to copy foreign langue reviews and paste them into my translator all from my phone. Something else nice to add would be more offline information. My biggest problem with a lot of apps is that you have to be online and when traveling away from your home country that can be very difficult and/or costly.
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
A todos los que buscan lugares de interes o restaurantes les recomiendo esta aplicacion. Esta super!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
Love this app! ;)
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 4
I just wish it had more of an interactive site like Yelp. Aside from that it is awesome. It helped is so much on our last trip. We did not eat at one bad restaurant thank GOD!!!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
Great app that makes it easy to find information and easy to write reviews. I love it!

Fast and reliable app that provides all the goodness of trip advisor.

This app is very helpful! Love having it to be able to plan my next trip or pick somewhere local to go!
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 4
So far a good free app w/o ads! Need more time to check all of the features out.....time, we all need more time?
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
So helpful definitely recommend !
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
Easier to find and search than the website I think!
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 4
Great app, very good listings easy to use but it does not provide the phone numbers to hotels that is my only complaint, other than that amazing!!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
I've been using Trip Advisor for a few years now and have been on several trips with my printed itinerary with things I discovered researching here.   I got a smart phone last November and was thrilled to see that there was an app for it.  At first I wasn't able to see 'saved' items in both locations but I can now.  And now on my iPad... I'm always planing trips now no matter what device I am on I can see it all... Hotels, sites to see, restaurants, reviews.. Love it, happy traveling!!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 4
Very useful app for everyone who travels.
Version 6.4 2012-09-07 5
Love everything about it! Well done
Version 6.4 2012-09-06 5
I've used various Trip Advisor apps for a while (a few years on various and sundry platforms) and have found all of them, including this one, to be very helpful. Are there limitations? Sure, but they can be easily overlooked or worked around by "Mr. Joe Average".

In other words, I like this program.
Version 6.4 2012-09-06 5
Amazing app it's a true blessing!

Version 6.4 2012-09-06 5
Love it
Version 6.4 2012-09-06 4
Great app.  easy to navigate, responsive.  Like having several different resources for prices, customer reviews, photos.  Map is great...better than AAA mobile app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-06 5
This app has been so helpful in a very small, rural destination. We have found the overall reviews to be accurate and to the point. We won't travel without it now!
Version 6.4 2012-09-06 5
Reliable source for the road warrior. Be sure to contribute to make it even better!
Version 6.3 2012-09-05 5
Simply EXCELLENT

A good way too check out things before u get there and we can make it better by updating
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
Great application with great features.
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
Best travel app and website need I say more? I love the new point in direction of place of interest it's like a gps that points you whe you need to go but with a simple arrow like a compas it's quite cool.
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 4
Great app!
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
Best application
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
Every reader must sort through the angry writers for true ratings. Some people missed their flight, lost luggage, etc and take it out on the resort or whatever.  Trip Advisor is my travel "go to" resource, wherever I go
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
Useful for holidays
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
I always use it when in unfamiliar territory, and it has been reliable 100% of the time!

Nice, easy to use.
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 4
The mobile app is simple to use to write reviews as well as add photos.
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
One of my fav apps
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 1
Was on Marriott Portland downtown clicked on map does not show on map correctly
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
What beats real-people reviews and photos?!
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 4
I love this app, and use it often. My only suggestion is to allow users to search within their destination city. I couldn't remember the name of a coffee shop in Traverse City that I wanted to review, but there isn't an option to search for "TC coffee shop". Would be 5 stars if that existed. Still, I use this app to find restaurants and things to do no matter where we stay at or visit.
Version 6.4 2012-09-05 5
Very functional with LOTS of reviews.

So far, works great!

I travel a lot for work and don't know how I did it before this app.  It gives reviews of hotels and places to eat among other things.  Love it.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Do not leave home without this app! Perfect on road trips. So easy to use.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Since I have used this app we have enjoyed unique restaurants near Boston and Myrtle Beach.   I don't like to use chain restaurants very often so some of the positive reviews for them are curious.   Great way to get to know about really good places.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Finding kid-friendly hotels and restaurants with extensive vegetarian menus used to be a challenge when away from home, but with my Tripadvisor app, it's a cinch. The reviews  and recommendations have never steered me wrong. Great app!
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
At home or on vacation, an informative and reliable source of places to eat, stay and play!
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Love it!!
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 5
Booked more than 50 Hotels, Restaurants, etc based on Tripadvisor Ratings so far and have never been disappointed.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 2
fairly nice app. but I can't find hotels to rate that are on the website. Example: Hotel Park Popovicky near prague.
Version 6.4 2012-09-04 4
For people going to different places and willing to know what other people suggested or liked.

The most helpful app and works everywhere you go
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 3
I am an avid Tripadvisor user, and can't rave enough about how much I love the site, but this app is just plain disappointing.  My biggest gripe is with the function of saving attractions, hotels, etc.  When browsing through the list for a city, every single time I "save" one of the attractions, it kicks me back to the first attraction.  I then have to go through page after page to return to where I started.

I do like the map of those saved locations, however.  And the "near me now" will be useful when traveling.  I just find the rest of the app clumsy, and needing some work on making it more fluid and easier to use.  There were even a few attractions that Tripadvisor.com found, but the iPad app could not.  Weird.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Great app
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
I have so enjoyed using this to get some info before I take my trips!!! I have also written my own reviews!! I think it is well worth using!! :0))
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
I am very confident to travel for having this apps. It helps us a lot in finding all the places that we need to go on our vacation. This is the apps that you need and a gps and presto, you will never get lost and you know what to expect because of the reviews..I give this a five star +. Excellent !
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Very helpful and user friendly. Used it a lot on a recent vacation
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 4
Can be awesome if it had better sorting and more details to add to reviews. What time of day if it was your first trip occasion. A way to see who the review is. Also needs more participation and better sorting. Not just popular/ price
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 4
Love and trust.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Solid app, trustworthy reviews. Well done on both iPhone and iPad.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 2
It works for finding attractions and such in a given area, but not very well. If you save an item, you can't delete it. It seems like you can, but then it doesn't work. Also if you're going through lots of pages of items, if you're on an item and you tap back, it always takes you back to the very first page of items instead of remembering which page you were on. These things are annoying enough to make me not want to use this app.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 4
This app needs the restaurant 1760 pub~n~grill in trexlertown Pennsylvania other than that it's pretty good
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
I check TA for EVERY trip I take whether business or vacay. If you take time to go through all the reviews of a place, you'll get a good idea of what it's like. App is easy to navigate, connects with online TA account. Love it. (works best on wifi)
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 2
TA is obviously a great site for travel info and one that I visit frequently, but their iPad version is poorly designed and buggy.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Trip Adviser is known for hotel reviews, but I truly love to use the "nearby attractions" feature to find fun things to do near my hotel.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Trip Advisor is the essential app for vacation planning. My wife and I have relied on the reviews to choose places to stay and those to avoid. We have also discovered activities we would never have found otherwise, such as The Jungle Place in Mexico, where we were able to interact with rescued Spider Monkeys. incredible!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Good
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 4
Looking up information with this app is great. Where TripAdvisor could provide more is in the relatively limited input for adding a review compared to what is available on the full site.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Easy and convenient! And finds cheap flights!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 4
Love this program
Version 6.1 2012-09-03 1
Great aesthetics, but bulky and slow to the point of not being practical. I can't spend my afternoon writing for the app to load!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
I keep track of all my hotels that I stay at all across the US and Canada.  I use it almost daily, 250-300 nights a year. I have about 70/80 on my saved list.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
This is such a helpful app!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Unbelievably helpful in Many ways !,... You will know a lot about  the country you visit and the places you might not have known of even if you have done a research on the country you intend to visit!.
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Great way to hear from people who have been there and experienced for themselves!
Version 6.4 2012-09-03 5
Great app for travel and even finding interesting things in your area. I use it all the time to find a nice place to eat or something to do either in the states or in Canada. Lots of user reviews and even pictures

Trip advisor gives you all the info you need - good & bad - from people like me.

Whether your looking for a flight, a hotel, or a vacation, nothing beats tripadvisor.  Easy to navigate you get all the info you need in seconds!
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5
I always rely in the user photos to see the actual hotel the way it really is
Version 6.4 2012-09-02 5
Do I need to say more?
Version 6.4 2012-08-31 5
So easy to navigate and great information! I would recommend this app for any travel research.  It's got a comprehensive selection of various travel reviews and helpful photos.
Version 6.4 2012-08-31 5
There is something new to explore with TripAdvisor App every tie you open it!

I have reservations at trattoria dal cavalier gino, ( highly recommended by locals), and wished to map it in trip advisor...
nope no can do... the APP tells me that the restaurant doesn't exist in Rome...YET, if one goes to the Ta web site, struggles through the " search" 
engine ... sure enough, there it is... 4.5 stars and all.... also, would be great if the app offered directions between saved sites...

Was losing my patience trying to find the right place to stay for our upcoming 25 anniversary. Thankfully I downloaded the Trip Advisor app and voila, it was a matter of minutes before we found and booked what should be an excitng vacation. Will certainly post our comments upon our return.

We are going to Kauai in October and TripAdvisor has already been helpful with our planning. The reviews from other travelers help us to make decisions on lodging and restaurants.
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
As well as website.  I rely on this one more than any other.
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
Excellent for looking for results or places to visit.
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 2
It's great to see hotels exist.... Why can't you see availability and prices for specific dates?
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
I used this app many times on my recent road trip vacation. We found so many great places to eat, and clean, reasonable places to stay, all right at my fingertips from the road! Excellent app, easy to use and I never would have found so many great places without it! Thank you Trip Advisor!
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 4
Easy to use and veeeeeeery helpfull!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
This app works well on my iPhone 3. Loads quick, handy control layout, and all the regular Tripadvisor features are there and easily accessed thru the limited screen of the phone.
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
I often check travel-related sites before going on a trip, just to get ideas of where to eat or stay and what to avoid.  Over the past year or so I have been spending more time using Tripadvisor and less time with some of the other apps. Get it! Use it!
Version 6.4 2012-08-28 5
Uses it for every destination for hotels, restaurants, attractions.  Works great.
Version 6.2 2012-08-28 5
This is a MUST have app! I love it!!!

Luv this app! Easy to use and does what it is supposed to do!
Version 6.3 2012-08-27 4
It is not perfect. I have concerns of "plants" posting in the forums. But I believe it is the most reliable available.
Version 6.4 2012-08-27 4
I think this is a great travel app that uses very well the spaceprovidedby the ipad.
Still... Would begreat to be able to book hotels and restaurants directly from here, without moving to other websites or apps
Version 6.4 2012-08-27 5
This App is great and easy to use.  I've used it three times this summer and it helped me save money.   Also you get to review many choices and compare them.
Version 6.4 2012-08-27 4
Very user friendly, helped me during travel plans!
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Great app for travel, checking out reviews for hotels, great recommendations for places to eat, and things to do. A must have & use!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Easy to use and easy to post. Has great info.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Because you have so many evaluators you get a fair and unbiased evaluation

Great app!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Awesome App!!!!

Love this app!  Found so many places we would have missed otherwise!  The point me there tool really worked!
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Thanks for providing a forum for ppl to read reviews for local places and for promoting favorite places!
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
As we wander around enjoying the sunshine on our motorcycle, Trip Advisor is a great resource!
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Trip advisor made our trip easy and relaxed. We went restaurant, hotel, and attraction recommended here. It was so easy and satisfying.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 4
I like the App, but it needs a spell checker. I used it all the time while visiting San Francisco. The map interface is very helpful in getting around when you are in a big city.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Love their traveller forums, too.  Great app...
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Gives a lot of things to do. Love it
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 4
Was a great help in planning a trip to Vermont & Montreal.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
I have used several apps and sites over the years to find places to stay when traveling for work. This is by far the best app for finding places to stay and eat when traveling. The reviews and pictures are very helpful.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Never knew there were so many things do to and places to dine just where I live. Great tool for trips as well.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
This is great for a traveler on the go. Everything great about trip advisor on my phone.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Yep...
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
I have never been steered wrong by Trip Advisor. We used it for a quick weekend to L.A. and Temecula, and used it the whole trip.   Just read the reviews, take all the info into consideration, and make a good choice with Trip Advisor.
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Everything I wanted and more, no problems accessing any features, great for travel and at home. Brochures and websites tell you what you want to hear, TripAdvisor tells it like it is!
Version 6.4 2012-08-26 5
Handy way of negotiating the world or your neighborhood. Reliable app, but it's the content that makes it great. Thanks TA and all the contributors.
Version 6.4 2012-08-25 5
I use Trip Advisor every time I look for a condo or hotel.  The reviews help me weed out the bad ones and narrow my focus.  Recently my travel
company,  Jan-Dar travel Services in Sarasota, Florida( aka Tradewinds) tried to book us into a hotel.  I read the reviews and found the hotel was rated very poorly and even had bedbugs!  Trip Advisor saved is from a miserable vacation!
 
I am starting to use it more for restaurants.  The reviews are really helpful.
Thank you Trip Advisor.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Excelente ayuda para los viajes.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
I use it a lot to plan my trips an the accuracy of he information is near to 100%.....highly recommend
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Very informative. Great idea to get some insight for your next travel destination.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
It's like having a guide with you the whole time. A must have!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 1
Fix or I delete, that simple. 
Can only view on iPad 1/2 the size!
Your choice! I'm sure I'm not the only
One.
Version 6.3 2012-08-17 5
Helpful when planning a trip or just enjoying my own town!
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Friendly design, perfect source of insiders info on places. Thanks to all who benefit!
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 4
This app is good in china's bigger cities.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Great service, good rates. Restaurant staff nice and friendly. Conveniently located near the freeway and airport.
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Never travel without checking other people's experiences!

I like it
Version 6.4 2012-08-17 5
Works like a dream every time. Loads quickly, and very uncluttered yet comprehensive interface.
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
My wife & used this app while touring Northern Michigan & the Upper Peninsula. We wanted no schedule, but were very interested in finding nice accommodations and good food at interesting places - where the locals eat - TripAdvisor SCORED for us on BOTH!

The App is easy to use, informative, ability to give all the great spots & even many great but not-too-well-known locations, and the search functions gets options others miss, while directions are usually very good. However as good as all those functions are - it was the reviews from other travelers that absolutely sealed the deal!
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 4
Amazing application for Tripadvisor. I just hope it is more adequate to use for Ipad and I really wish if it were easier to add new places there.
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 4
Really helps narrow down a restaurant if you are visiting somewhere new, and for your own comfort locales, verifies what you already knew.
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
Easy, simple smooth and perfect when you just need to tell someone about your experience! I always know my app is ready to either let me vent or praise!
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 3
Tripadvisor is a great tool to help in your travels... By reading many reviews.. Even the bad ones.. You get an idea of what to expect
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
So far it's working great and is easy to use
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 1
If there is a link under Eatgood restaurant, I expect that will take me to the restaurant website where I can look at the menu. No such luck. With trip advisor all you get is more trip advisor!  The app is free and in this case you get what you pay for.
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
I'm a big fan trip advisor in general and this app stays true to the helpfulness I love from them. The only thing I would suggest would be to not have the reviews under a drop down menu. That's what you're known for and it took me a while to find them!
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
Excellent App for really figuring out your hotel choices based on reviews!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
I started using this app long before I joined TA. I now love writing reviews and getting other reviews before I go to do anything.  Great application.
Version 6.4 2012-08-16 5
Polished, easy to use and quite useful. The user reviews let you travel to new destinations with confidence. My go- to app for travel

It was so helpful on vacation   Found one of the best BBQ restaurants with it
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 1
I can't find anything on the map now! I'm ready to delete this app. I used to use it quite a bit. Very disappointing since the update.
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5
Best price and hotel.
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5
Very helpful. I like that it lets me save as many hotels as I like and it sorts them by town.
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5
It is a great app to know which hotel to pick and to stay in and to know all of the reviews about them :)
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5
Good for almost anywhere in the world!  Highly recommended.
Version 6.3 2012-08-15 5
Tripadvisor  is awesome backpacker app and well traveller.. Use it for find accomedation. And resto and bars ..
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5
Takes the stress out of making travel decisions.
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5

Absolutely love this app! So helpful, just wish we could rate the reviews on how helpful they are.
Version 6.4 2012-08-15 5
I enjoy using this app. Makes it so easy to find close by restaurants, hotels and attractions. I have used this extensively while traveling.
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 1
It doesn't have ANY of the website filtering... Just horrible...
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
Easy format makes it simple to review things while on a trip as well as avoid places which get bad reviews!
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
Love it!
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
Very user interace friendly .. I totally recommend it
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5
I really like the grid format when searching for various flight options.  My only suggestion would be to have a recommended list of the actual flights which offer the lowest fares rather than having to determine the right combinations.
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 4
i have never eaten anywhere bad since i used tripadvisor
the app just takes a little lobg to buffer
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5

Very useful, just used it on a trip to Colombia, every hotel and restaurant we visited had the descriptions from Trip Advisor.
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 4
The program is easy to use. Easy to post a review on and very helpful.
Version 6.4 2012-08-14 5

Version 6.1 2012-08-13 5
Love trip advisor!! I never leave home without it and never disappointed by its recommendations
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 5
Very reliable, easy to use. I have never been steered wrong with the advice I learned through Trip Advisor.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 5
This is by far the best app to find things happening around you. A friend works for Trip Advisor and she told me about it a few months. I had never heard of them until then and now I'm in love :)
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 5
Love it to express my happiness or my anger at my experience.  By far the best.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 4
I have always liked the Trip Advisor web site.  The app works really well.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 4
This is by far the easiest and best travel comparison application I found so far. Good job!
Version 6.3 2012-08-13 5
This is the greatest thing since sliced bread :-)
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 4
I almost always check on TripA what others said about a destination, a hotel or restaurant or sight, before I make my travel plan. There are two types of outliers, which I make sure to ignore: the reviews of those who were upset/angry/disappointed about something that has little to do with the quality of the destination and those who write unjustifiably glowing praise mainly because they loved the waitress or the bellboy! I wish there were filters to discard those types of reviews.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 4
Works very well! Awesome mobile version of the traveler's resource.
Version 6.4 2012-08-13 5
Well organized and the bookmark feature is great!

This place had terrible cooks, that overcooked the food.  There was food all over the floor in the cooking area and the eating area.  The service was marginal.   Much better places in Tulsa for this type of cooking
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 2
Huge utility, but hard to navigate.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5
Works well

SO helpful, it is the travelers must have!
Version 6.3 2012-08-12 1
Cannot even download the updated version. It's just clogging up my iPhone at this point.
Version 6.1 2012-08-12 5
Really very useful app for planning your trips!
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5
Awesome.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 4

Wouldn't plan or leave for a trip without...found the comments to be invaluable in planning for trip to London for Olympics.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5
I use it all the time. Could add hours of operation for businesses
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 4

I love this app... I helped so much, when planning a trip.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5
I wouldn't go on a trip and go to a restaurant or book a hotel without checking trip advisor first. Must have!
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 4
This app functions nicely and will get more useful as content is added.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 4
The TA app is very helpful to scout out spots for meals and to find places to visit. The iPad version is a little clunkier than the PC version but it is sufficient. There is a wealth of information from fellow travelers. There needs to be an easy home page non-FB sign-in area.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5
Easy to use app. No hidden instructions or menus. Everything is very straight-forward and easy to use.
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5
This app has saved me from some horrible hotel stays!  It also helped me find some great gems. Thanks!
Version 6.4 2012-08-12 5

Vai ser meu grande companheiro de viagem!
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 2
Unfortunately a web search reveals reviews for a lot more restaurants on Anna Maria Island than are accessible through the app. Not good. Let's hope this gets fixed in the next update.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 4
We've used this site recently for a trip to Europe, a trip to New York City, and planning a conference in Oregon. TripAdvisor was extremely helpful for all these uses, especially for hotels.  I particularly appreciate knowing the type of trip people are on and the comments help me judge whether the positive or negative experience would apply to me. A great example was one hotel in Germany near a church where the bells ring all night. One reviewer said it was charming and gave a high rating. It would have driven me nuts!!! The mapping feature is helpful for figuring out logistics and the ability to make reservations for many restaurants directly from the site is great. It really offers one stop shopping and planning.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
Discovered this app while in Vermont for a wedding. Set up perfectly to get a general idea of cities and will even direct right to google maps for directions. I will use this every time I travel
Version 6.2 2012-08-11 5
Love this app for my iPad. Links to Maps, which is very convenient.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
Find it to be reliable. Consistent and accurate. We travel all over the US also used it in UK, Ireland, EU for hotels and restaurants.  I have it on my iPad and we use it as our number 1 guide.

Still rely on it
Version 6.3 2012-08-11 5
Simply the best travel app out there! Don't be fooled by others- TripAdvisor is the real deal.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 2
Before i was able to see the indian currency. But after the update no indian currency. Its showing $ dollar.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 4
Found a good hotel for a very price. Fairly accurate assessment of the property .
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 4
Very few issues with crashing. A stable app. Easily laid out. I would prefer if I could access my reviews through it though. You can access "my saves" so if you'd like access to your reviews you would have to add your reviews to that for access in one place it seems.
Version 6.3 2012-08-11 5
I never book a hotel without consulting TA. The app is just as user friendly as the web site
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
We never try a new place (hotel, b&b, restaurants, etc.) unless we check trip advisor. Even lower stars we'll still try because sometimes the choices are slim, but at least we know what to expect ahead of time. :) 
It's like one of those things you don't leave home without.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
Checking Trip Advisor before venturing out can make the best of your experience. Genuine people with genuine comments!
Version 6.3 2012-08-11 3
The website is my go to for trip planning. The app is good for a quick look but lacks the full functioning of the website.  I am sure that it will continue to improve with updates.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
Awesome site, very helpful.
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 4
I always check it before booking new places.

Love this app and the website ...I haven't had any problems so far
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 2
The app search function is crippled.  Is this intentional?

What a pain in the rear end to try to find something.  BTW I love the full web site but this app is but a shadow of it.  Why not make it fully functional before going live?
Version 6.4 2012-08-11 5
I love his app because it helps me make informed decisions as well as help others. I always use this when I travel and I love writing reviews for trip advisor.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Great application if you are planning a trip. I read the reviews every day to make sure my trip will be enjoyable. Highly recommend.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 4
I use this all the time before I start a trip. Even if some places are closed. I will open tripadvisor app instantly for other near by places.

The only prob is the address are not clear for uncommon places.

However I like this app a lot.  A way to explore new places!!!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 2
Installed update on orig. iPad.  Operation is now sluggish with frequent freezes/crashes containing message that "the page went away".  Only way out is to exit app and wait for it to finally clear so I can start over.  This has been my go-to app for travel info, so this is very frustrating.  Hope it is fixed soon!
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
I like rating with this app. It's easier than some others
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Great app, I find it better than the actual website
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Use it all the time when planning or on a trip

Lots of good information from fellow travelers.  Great ideas for places to visit that aren't always on the beaten path.  Hasn't steered me wrong yet.

Version 6.4 2012-08-10 1
It's very bad update and when i open the app it's ask me do you want to instal the app or go to the website ? 
Please returned the old version
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Great love it
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 4
My first time using Trip Advisor... I liked it but there were some things that were confusing such as sometimes there seems to be an option to filter by distance and sometimes not.  I'll definitely use it again, though.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Awesome tool to make concise and precise choices when traveling.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Use this all the time!
Version 6.3 2012-08-10 5
Great app for both looking up info & writing reviews.
Version 6.4 2012-08-10 5
Very smooth
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
one of the best apps out to help you choose your vacation package, flights, rentals, or hotels!!!!! With helpful reviews!!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 2
Recent update ruined a perfectly good app... Why?? Previous version was much easier to use and more helpful. My saves from a trip I am planning are gone and that great feature is no longer available.
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 1
What happened to "my saves" function? The new update cleared out all my saves. I had prepared this for next week's vacation.
Version 6.3 2012-08-09 5
I love that I can have dinner (or hotel, etc.) and snap a few photo's and post them in a minute! Very easy to use!!
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
Great app! Very helpful on my upcoming Italy trip. Thanks Tripadvisor!
Version 5.9 2012-08-09 2
It's an OK app overall. Clean and sharp looking. Simple, and there's the drawback.

Needs some better filtering or tag functionality. 

Blocks you if you do not have the most up to date copy of the app. Happened at the most inopportune time and made the app useless.
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
Wow
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 1
I loose a lot of time with this app and do not get the info I need.
Version 6.4 2012-08-09 5
Hasn't steered me wrong yet.  Use this app all the time when out of town...
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
Just got this app. Love it - intuitive - very well thought out.  I'll be using and contributing very often!
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
I really like the app. Helpful in planning trips and seeing options for hotels, etc. I HATE FACEBOOK and wish you would drop the marketing for it.
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
I've always enjoyed the TripAdvisor website and now I have a handy app that lets me access all that information from the convenience of my iPhone. This is great!
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 5
I use it all the time. I find it very accurate. No more restaraunt hit and miss!
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
Love it!
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
We use this for all travel!

La mejor.....
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 5
I frequently use trip advisor,therefore I love having the handy app for my iPad! everything is easy to find and self explanatory. A must have app for on the road traveling!
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
Good
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
Very helpful for planning trips!
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
On our cross country adventure we used this app frequently to find things to do and places to eat.  During the loooong drive, I was able to research and then save a list of items for each city.  Made the trip so much fun!
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 1
Loved city guides until they came up with the new(?) offline update! Now, after the installation the app. Won't even open......come on guys! You can do better than that!!!!!
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 3
Helpful  but a bit clumsy with slow internet connections, which are common when I travel abroad and could use suggestions.  Takes way too long to load!  Disappointed there is no way to upload photos or view profiles like on the website.
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 2
I'm a big fan of Trip Advisor but the app is not what it could be. Just a map, really. Come on, you can do better than this!
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 5
Want a local review, traveling, wondering what a restaurant is REALLY like... It doesn't get any better than trip advisor.  I can't remember a time when I used trip advisor - and my restaurant experience wasn't EXACTLY what was mentioned on trip advisor.... I swear by this app!
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 3
Its fine...but dump facebook marketing intro please.
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 5
Works well..easy to use.
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 5
Terrific version of the full site, faster and more efficient with really good mapping integration.
Version 6.3 2012-08-08 5
Love it.... Mostly all good suggestions.
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
Great!
Version 6.4 2012-08-08 5
Site is very informative.
Version 6.4 2012-08-07 5
I use it all the time.
Version 6.3 2012-08-07 4
Great for planning a vacation. Indispensable and easy to use. But no longer shows b&bs! One star off!
Version 6.4 2012-08-07 5
App comes in handy since we enjoy taking frequent mini vacations.
Version 6.3 2012-08-07 5
Having this app has made last minute travels a breeze. Use it time and time again.
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 3
good app not sure why it doesn't show attractions in top rated order.
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 4
I like it. Would just recommend adding more categories to search.
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 4
It's good but it needs more information about the places and pictures .
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 4
... I have the app downloaded but when I am in Safari and hit on a TA link, it doesn't recognize that's already have the app
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 4
Just had to keep begging me to rate the app... That popup every five seconds is what dropped it a star, it's a good app though would also be nice to have links to the actual website of the hotels- b&bs.
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 5
I travel a lot for pleasure and business. Finding a good hotel or restaurant in a place you do not know is not easy. 
This site gives a balanced overview. I have used it so much in the last two years that I have decided to start contributing my reviews as well.
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 4
Great options and I am enjoying learning the app better.
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 5
Very helpful, easy to use, organized, and the reviews are great!
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 5
Since discovering Trip advisor Whenever we find ourselves in a new city we are assured of good eating places and fun things to do.  Last year we were in the Big Apple and it was invaluable with helping us to narrow down our choices.  Right now we are in Orange Beach, Alabama and thanks to Trip advisors one meal has been better then the other.  Read the reviews....
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 5
One of my favorite apps. Use it all the time. Reviews are usually right on the mark for most everything you encounter on the road.
Version 6.3 2012-08-06 5
What a great find. 
Trip Advisor saved the day for us while on vacation and found for us (through their reviews) a great restaurant after a long difficult day of driving. Made all the difference to end on a high note and we would never have found that restaurant without Trip Advisor. 
We will be using it throughout the rest of this trip!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
awesome app!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 3
I have found that sometimes the search function does not work well.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
I wish I would have found this prior to my last vacation. So far, very helpful.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
I stayed with my daughter, visited my dad, and met my husband for romantic hotel stay. Trip advisor helped me find good places to eat and visit, with and without my grandchildren. It's also easy to share my experiences with others to help them find places they are more likely to enjoy. I recommend it.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
Trip Advisor helped me plan our beach trip to Tybee Island. We didn't miss a thing thanks to Trip Advisor!!!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
It is great to hear what impresses customers most.  TripAdvisor helps us focus on what people love and address things we can improve!  Thanks for helping first timers choose us!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
Every detail down to a compass to help you walk there
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
Very usefull!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 4
Like that it brings up the actual names of places instead of just dropping pins!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
I plan all of my vacations from my iPhone now. Or, when I'm traveling, I use it as a quick reference for reliable restaurants or last minute hotels.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
This app helped my family immensely when trying to find a hotel to stay in while in an unfamiliar area. The map features are great. I especially appreciate the high quality of the traveler reviews.
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
This is a very helpful app a+
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 4
Very good & practical app. Most reviews are right on the money. If you're looking for a family place, reasonable prices, this app the best!!
Version 6.3 2012-08-05 5
I love this app!!  I use it all of the time!!
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 5
Helps us find the great little spots we would miss when traveling!

Version 6.3 2012-08-03 5
Great App, user friendly, use it all the time for trip planning.
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 3
Tripadvisor has been accurate for places to visit. However not accurate for hotels.
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 4
This is a good app for business purposes.
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 4
Easy to navigate
Version 6.1 2012-08-03 5
I love that Tripadvisor links to other sites and resources I would normally access separately, like Open Table, hotels.com, travel booking sites, and it has a discussion forum where you can learn tips about the places you want to go from those who've been there. Love the honest reviews! Very useful. It's my go to site. I planned an unforgettable short trip to NYC with my husband all through Tripadvisor!
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 5
We consult Trip whenever we travel. Great tips on hotels, restaurants, and suggested sites. A very valuable travel companion, indeed! Great app!
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 3
I like this app but it seems like they only developed it halfway. I can think of many features that would improve it and make it truly useful while traveling. As it is, it's ok but could be a million times better. I hope they continue developing it.

For example, why doesn't the map update results when I zoom or move the map? Why no breadcrumbs so I don't have to hit the back button many times? Why no smart search and navigation that remembers my search and clicks? User experience is really incomplete. Makes it difficult to really use. 

Since it's a travel app, should be optimized to work quicker since many parts of the world have slow Internet speeds. Slow and freezes if I challenge it with a few clicks.

Mostly I hate that it only works in landscape. Come on!
Version 6.3 2012-08-03 5
Very useful don't have to go on to internet good for mobile and pad devices

And who gives a crap about nicknames?

Or sucking up to face plant.
Version 6.3 2012-07-31 5
This is an excellent source for finding information on places you are thinking or planning on visiting.  Most of the review give a prettty acurate review of the facility  .
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
Love it
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 3
This app is very convenient for writing reviews when I am on the go. It is also good for checking out places when I am just roaming around and don't have a specific plan. Still, for more complete reviews I write, I would rather go to the website. Additionally, I do not like that I can't see my past review information through the app.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5

Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
Appears to be very useful and user friendly. We plan to go to Washington. There is a ton of things to do there and the app will help to sort things out.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 4
We owners of Vacation Rental should be shown on Trip Advisor as house ot Vacation rentals I go to Luquillo and There is only Yunque mar and Luquillo Sunrise and the rest nowhere to be found unless you know about Flipkey.com property 172169 . Please This helps everyone Families that are looking for value and a nice place with all amenities even better than Hotels Five or Seven Stars.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 2
This app would be wonderful IF 

1) When one selects See On Map, one could actually see the place zoomed in enough on the map that you can actually find it. If you try to zoom in, it loses the location, making this function almost worthless except to find out the general region. 

2) When saving potential Things to Do, Hotels, or Restaurants, the app does not remember where you were in the list, and instead, goes back to the beginning. You then have to alternately scroll down and press the Next 10 link through the many pages back to where you were. Really annoying.

3) My Saves could be grouped into the various categories, rather than all thrown in together. It makes going back to find something later a chore.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 2
I check this app every couple of days for my work.  Please change it so that once I decline to link to Facebook that you don't force me to open Facebook every time.  It gets annoying and makes me not want to open this app up.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
If you are planning a trip get this.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 1
As they add new features,and "improved" experiences this program is becoming a buggy, crashy mess.  Was writing a review on trip advisor, a long review, and it crashed erasing all my work.  So now I am writing a review of the app instead. And the new map thingy: not so go as the old one.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
Good  program
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 4
I've relied on TripAdvisor both in & outside US. If there is a better ap for travel info, I haven't found it. Only flaw, not everywhere has been reviewed.
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
I use this to check on what people are saying about hotels, restaurants, etc... Gives me an idea in what hotels to check into!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
So glad for TripAdvisor, I use it every time I travel!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
The App is very cool!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
I have only just started using this app and it already outshines all the paid for apps I bought for my trip, as far as organizing my info into a useful format. I can't wait to take this app out on the road. Thanks!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
I'll never travel without this app again!
Version 6.3 2012-07-30 5
We travel all the time. I always use TA in every town that we go to.  It doesn't let me down.

I have tried to publish a review of the Ryan's restaurant here in Crossville, Tn. So far they haven't after four attempts. Too bad... Oh yeah, Ryan's is a filthy place to eat. I was sick for 3 days after my unfortunate dining adventure.
Version 6.1 2012-07-29 1
It is impossible to look for things nearby, or to research a specific destination. Once you are at a city and you would like to look for a certain restaurant it reverts back to a worldwide search. It does this with anything you can think of.
Google still has this beat.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
I love TA ... I wish it had a filter for boutique hotels (like hotel Giraffe in NYC) but otherwise have found it to be a really accurate tool.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 4
I love trip advisor and used it a lot on my last vacation. The mobile app works fine, but seems way to limited.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5

Trip advisor app is a place to get some ideas on your trip. This is one tool that does help plan a trip.

Very helpful app!!!
Beat google out of The park ..
It's all in one
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
Trip advisor is a useful tool and valuable resource for people who are too busy to research every detail of a trip for themselves. I have used it to discover restaurants I might have otherwise missed and will always use it from now on to look into possible accommodations when planning business travel.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
We travel a lot so this app is one of the best that I have I use it all the time
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 4
Excelente ayuda!
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 3
My big gripe about this app is it's search ability.  It is not intuitive and if you don't spell the restaurant name exact, you won't find it.  When the fix that, I'll give it four stars.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
I always use tripadvisor for the reviews and was never disappointed.
Version 6.3 2012-07-29 5
This is one of the most useful apps I have - easy to use, full of information.

Version 6.3 2012-07-28 4
I like it that it synchs with Facebook, so the world knows where I'm at, lol.  also great material, info from people that has actually  been to the suggested places.  No better critic that us that pay to stay places, eat at places, and so on.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 2
I love trip advisor. However, the app is nowhere near as good as when I use the site through Safari on any of my mobile devices. I hate using the app.  It just isn't that good (no offense).  I just don't see the benefit of using the app over going to the site.  I wish the app was better. With that said, it will do the basic stuff you may need. So to summarize, I give trip advisor, the site, 5+ stars, but the app only 2 (and I'm being generous).
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5

This app works every time I've used it. It is very helpful in finding quality hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues. I'm addicted!
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
I used it for our cross country trip to compare different amusement parks, find local restaurants vs fast food only that would be close to our route,  and of course find hotels. Readers reviews, when there are enough of them, help make the best trip possible. reliable info   helps set expectations and avoid expensive and time consuming disappointment. Great tool.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
Best app I've gotten- Very handy when traveling !
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
We really just started using this site this year and I have to say now I don't really want to go anywhere with out checking out trip advisor first!! So far all of the reviews have been spot on.  Once in a while there will be one or two that have a bad experience some where but I usually check to see that the majority of the reviews say similar positive things. Then I know that it will be a good choice!
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
This app is great! I like the fact that I can map around a particular area to see what's there. I just did trips to 2 new areas that I wouldn't have considered if not for this app.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 1
So very disappointed! I needed a room at the last minute and was only given about 5 choices for the ENTIRE Phoenix-Scottsdale-Tempe area (population greater than 1 million). I agreed to go with Zona in Scottsdale UNTIL at the VERY last minute the app informed me of an extra $15.00 fee that was NOT listed in the original fees (on the feed page). Really? So instead of a $68 room it was going to be $83.00 which was not revealed until I went through the trouble of entering my card info. Smelling a scam with this app. Instead I went to Expedia app (location services) and found a great room at a great price.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
This is a terrific app! If you are traveling or just staying local check it out.  I've used it internationally as well as in the USA.  It has become my go to for info.  Thank you TA.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 4
This app is great. I used it quite a bit to find info on everything during a roadtrip. I love the save feature. However, if you are a play it by ear person, this app is useless without 3G or wifi which is much of the country when driving. It's not perfect, but quite useful. A keeper!!
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 4
It's good.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 4
Just started using this app.  It seems to work well with no problems.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
I have my fair share of travel apps including yelp and opentable, but the ranking feature on Tripadvisor lets me quickly find out what fellow travelers thinks is the best.  It is easy to use and navigate.  I love the save feature so I can quickly bookmark ideas that what I want to revisit.  I wish the reviews would somehow integrate with yelp reviews at least on food.  Overall, highly recommend to anyone who likes to travel.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
This app is a must have if you to find out some great information. It helps to hear from those that have experienced a local place.
Version 6.3 2012-07-28 5
Really cool app. You get to see others reviews.

Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
Very friendly app...
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
This is the best app I have ever used for travel. I check out every hotel and know after a few reviews if I want to stay. Ditto on the restaurants. Things to see never let me down. This is a must have app if you travel at all
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 1
Tripadvisor is NOT fair.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 4
Informative
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 4
Practical, easy, fast, rich content, lots of customer reviews. Reliable. I would give it 5 Stars if it paid my trip expenses.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 4
Love to use this while traveling. The reviews are helpful, however some people are much more picky than me, complaining about every little thing. I take it with a grain of salt, because some people have cups half empty and some just plain can't even find their cup! Used all week with success in Kauai. Aloha!
Version 6.1 2012-07-27 5

Have used Tripadvisor to help me plan my vacations in the US and South America and for me it is a fantastic tool
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
Love this app. Use it all the time as we travel quite a bit.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
Great site. Takes guess work out of finding a restaurant, etc.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
We were traveling 1000 miles from home to somewhere we had never been and was unfamiliar with the entire route. This app was very handy finding restaurants. Just wish it would have been able to find gas.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 5
I love this site people really tell you like it is for the most part.
Version 6.3 2012-07-27 4
I used this app for the 1st time on a trip to myrtle beach and it really helped weed out all the paid endorsements I saw for restaurants and made our choices much easier.

Version 6.3 2012-07-26 5
As usual with trip advisor, easy to use, dependent on people to write good reviews
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 4
Finally - A travel site based on Real Traveler's reviews.  Trip Advisor has broken the old, tired format of online travel services.  Get the nitty gritty on a new restaurant, whether in your neighborhood or across the globe.  No hype - Just real reviews by travelers like you and me.

The travel advisories are handy as can be.  If you want, Trip Advisor will keep an eye on airfares for that upcoming trip.

Trip Advisor is user friendly and the mosr handy travel aid I have found.
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 5
Excellent, very helpful.
Version 6.2 2012-07-26 5
I love this app! Especially the photos people share. That way you can really see what a place looks like and not just "staged" photos!
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 5
Great job on this app.
Version 6.2 2012-07-26 5
I am a big Trip advisor fan but was skeptical about the app until I tried it. Very handy when you are on your trip, need info., and cannot get to your computer. I have used it in Vegas and in Estes Park.
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 5
Works as advertised. Very helpful.
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 5
Very useful. Great information.
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 4
This is one of the best apps yet.
Version 6.2 2012-07-26 5
I love Tripadvisor! I refer to it on a regular basis . I love reading the reviews and most of them are pretty accurate. It's a great travel Bible with 
very good advice. I'm a Tripadvisor  fan for sure and being a frequent traveller who appreciates the best places- I give reviews myself.
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 3
It works, I like using the current location to find things near where I am.
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 2
The app is easy to use, but the prices/rates are the same if not more expensive than others of its kind,  Nothing special about this Ap.
Version 6.3 2012-07-26 4
I use this all the time!

Found a great place to eat in Cave City, KY with Trip Advisor. It has been very helpful everywhere we travel.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 1
They do not seem to accept bad reviews. I tried to report bed bugs in my hotel room and they rejected it.  I re-submitted and will amend my review if they accept.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
This app is great!  You can find pretty much everything anywhere you want to go.

I need this app. I don't go in a store or restaurant before checking with the reviews they have. Then being able to go straight to a map also! Great.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
Amazing ....makes my life so much easier...
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
All the reviews are helpful when we're in a new city and not sure about a restaurant or touring site. The reviews save us from wasting our time with something we wouldn't be interested in as well finding restaurants in our area and budget.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
Great app.very helpful.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
I like both to plan carefully and to improvise, and this app lets me do both, on the fly. I'd say our trip to new England was at least 50% improved by this app and Yelp.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
My wife and I are retired, in our early 60's, travel extensively and use the hell out of this app!  For users, please continue to actively and objectively submit reviews and also expand the type of categories reviewed.  The info makes travel SO much easier to decide upon booking AND makes worthwhile suppliers corrects deficiencies as well as reinforcing their good points.
The fact that these reviews are being penned by actual "users" makes the reviews so much more credible and valuable.
We generally throw out the top-rated reviews and ignore the low-bies as well.  (Some folks can't be pleased while others tend to oversell.  That's why it's nice to have a depth of reviews to work from.
Keep up the great work, Reviewers and thank you for continued input!
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
Without exception, my starting point for any trip & in particular, booking a hotel starts with Trip Advisor - it never lets me down with only one exception (when the reviews were glowing & the hotel was awful) out of dozens of bookings. Got to have it.
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5
very good concept
Version 6.3 2012-07-24 5

Using Trip Advisor is better than purchasing travel insurance.  I use it for guidance in selecting places, getting the most for my travel dollar, to help me know if the accommodation has what I want & need & to find out about great places to visit & things to do during my vacation. Thanks, Trip Advisor!
Version 6.3 2012-07-23 5

I don't ever give a perfect score but this ap was a life saver! I was traveling solo across Europe and the only complaint is that I didnt find this sooner on my travels. I downloaded the Paris and London apps before I arrived to the cities. It afforded me the luxury of having a map and all the "best of" at my fingertips. Not only was that convenient, but a few times when I got lost within a few blocks from the location all I had to do was to click on the arrow that says get me there and the compass directs you. I also had the luxury of looking for restaurants around where I was with reviews without Internet. I found some fabulous small local restaurants with delicious cuisine because of this ap! I really feel like this ap is a must especially when traveling abroad, it helped enhance my experience immensely!
Version 6.3 2012-07-22 4
It works great just like the website. Good Job guys!
Version 5.8 2012-07-22 5

Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
This app is everything you need or would expect if you went to their website: find new places, read reviews, see pictures, and write reviews. Great app!
Version 6.2 2012-07-15 4
Remember, the people reviewing amount to an average, meaning many will be far less adventurous and far more inane about things an experienced traveller would ignore. so I suggest using the usual statistical ploy of throwing out the high and low ratings and focusing on the upper middle. if people take the time to review then they have something that really matters to them, but that is usually extreme. people who review as a common curtesy are to be more trusted, even if they too lack perspective of an Anthony Bourdain etc. use this app, contribute to it. 

the interface is a bit quirky at times but it works.
Version 6.3 2012-07-15 5
I love the TripAdvisor app for both the iPhone and iPad. They are easy to use, loads information fast and makes it easy to save information about hotels, restaurants, and attractions. I had many wonderful travel experiences with TripAdvisor's apps.

Bing maps ruins this app, the updates are taking the app in the wrong direction.  Why on earth do they continue to insist on bing maps...I bought an iPad not a dopey Surface...is tripadvisor owned by MSFT, that is the only reason I can think of as to why they would continue down this obviously dubios path...if they continue to use bing maps after apple releases their new maps functionality I'll just delete all together, never come back, and use the several other travel apps that actually have their acts together.

Would not want to travel without it. My family and I took a recent trip and this app could not have been more correct. Photos and tips are on point. Thank you so much.
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 3
I guess I need help and can't find, on the app, where to get help.  I've written 3 reviews now and keep getting the same message (take care of something in red; although there is NOTHING in red) and the app will not post my review.  I am signed in.  Very frustrating in that regard.  Bringing up nearby things to do and hotels and other services is very nice, however.
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 4
I love this app but I couldn't find what restaurant I was looking for. Please add it. ( I could only find it on the iPhone. The restaurant name is Okko)
Version 6.2 2012-07-09 5
No fads. No frills. No fancy stuff. Just does what it's supposed to do. We use it whenever we're out and about.

I travel a lot, and this app is the one I use the most!  Moved out west from the east coast a year ago and me and my husband love traveling on the weekends and exploring new places and the Trip Advisor app has been a life saver!! We've found an awesome B&B we love in Durango (Country Sunshine, which is the #1 B&B for good reason!) that we've gone too about 6 times now and we are now visiting Phoenix for the first time and found an awesome resort with a waterpark (Arizona Grand Resort) which our 15 year old loves!... And so do we!! (got to visit the Heard Museum and Botanical Garden!) the app is very user friendly and straight forward! And the IPad version is awesome!  Also as we were making our long trek from PA to NM found a really neat place to stay in Branson, MO... Thanks to Trip Advisor... Big Cedar Lodge... Beautiful!! I'm now trying to decide where we are going to have an awesome meal tomorrow in the Phoenix area.... The past two days breakfast has been great! Yesterday was Over Easy which was on Guy Fuiti's triple D... Was delish! Then this morning went to "the original pancake house" which originated in Oregon and my daughter said they were the best pancakes she ever had... WOW! She has pancakes everywhere!!! And I had their famous apple pancake which was totally amazing, and I could only eat a third of it it was sooooo big and the three of us are now eating as dessert tonight which still tastes amazing cold!!! This is one of my favorite apps definitely recommend to everyone!!!

The app seems the same as the website, but when you search, it keeps losing the search terms, so you need to keep re entering the city name. Incredibly frustrating. Frustrating enough for me to stop looking at the nice scenery and write this review.
Version 6.2 2012-07-07 4
Delicious food and impeccable service. A must in Zihuaranejo, MX

Enjoy reading other's reviews and find this app to be helpful, but the site could be better for someone trying to write a review. 
Find the Urban Spoon app to be better when looking/leaving reviews on restaurants.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 5
If any of the General Managers or Property Managers would look at the site and see what is being said, they could see things from their guests views. It would help in training, and improvements. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A COMPLAINT ABOUT TWO THINGS!!!!!  #1. Never should there be a complaint about the cleanliness of their room!
#2. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE ANY NEGATIVE REMARKS LEFT ABOUT THE FRONT DESK STAFF! THEY SET THE TONE FOR THE GUESTS STAY! FIRST IMPRESSION................
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 4
Helpful app for arranging travel plans. It's organized with headings that make easier to find exactly what you want whether it's a hotel or B & B, or sit down or fast food restaurant. It's also nice to view reviews of my work in the tour industry.
Version 6.2 2012-07-06 2
I was enjoying this app but when I went to write a review it keeps giving me the message to correct the items highlighted in red.  The problem is that there is nothing highlighted in red.  Very frustrating.

Nice app, always use it before booking hotels and restaurants.

Excellent App! Highly recommend !

I have enjoyed the features of TripAdvisor.  The multi option hotel reservations feature is great. The only disappointing feature is missing price range for the restaurants. I went to City Range steak house grill and it was over priced for the amount of food. The reviews did warn me of the service but I did have good service.
Version 6.2 2012-07-05 5

Not finding four out of four very established and long term restaurants in Toronto seems more than slightly lame. Really, the Coffee Tree has been in Bloor West Village for more than 20 years and has a phenomenal reputation but its not in Trip Advisor? I've done a lot of reviews and use this  application lots, but this is the most frustrating bit of stupidity I've encountered in a long time.
Version 6.2 2012-07-05 5
Great app! So useful on the go.

We turn to trip advisor for advice on accommodations, dining and things to do both before and during our trips. It's usually spot-on and better than urban spoon for dining options   Thank you!

I use this app a lot less than I used to. I do not like the landscape only view. I don't have a Facebook account, because I don't want one, yet it asks me to sign into Facebook every time! Can I have the option to turn that off?

When I get interested in a listing and want to zoom in it using the map, the listing change. Aggravating

In summary all of the 'enhancements' aren't improving what was already a great app.

I've stayed only places that TripAdvisor reviewers rate 3-4 stars and it's never let me down!
Version 6.2 2012-07-02 5
This app is very intuitive and informative. The way it's laid out makes it really easy to find what you are interested in. The only comments I have are that the places brought up on the trip advisor website aren't necessarily the same as those on the app. Also, I couldn't figure out how to send a website linked to from the app to a friend, because the web address wasn't displayed. Maybe that's just me missing something though.

There appears to be a bug in the ipad app. When submitting a review it keeps displaying red message asking to correct the red marked area whereas there is none to correct. I spent a lot of time submitting reviews and don't know whether these will be posted.

Really frustrating to be looking for stuff near where I am and get search results for St. Louis whilst I am in Memphis, TN. Not exactly my definition of near. The other complaint is adding new places is not intuitive or easy to do from within the app.  I don't do it often and I've just basically quit adding new places since after 20 minutes of hunting, I couldn't find it....  
That said, the content is great, even if the app is mediocre.  Have identified great cheap hotel in Beijing and introduced people to new restaurants in their hometown based on recommendations from Trip Advisor reviews.

I am an avid user of tripadvisor, and now of this app. I am always checking reviews before staying at a hotel, and always leaving reviews when I can, and this app makes it even easier to take it on the go. Five stars as far as I am concerned.

On a recent road trip to Europe, we didn't want to make hotel and dinner reservations in advance because we didn't want to be constrained. I downloaded this Trip Advisor app to my iPad and each time we decided to stop to eat or call it a night, I consulted this app and decided where to eat and sleep based on fellow travelers' recommendations. Not once were we disappointed . It is like having one's own concierge service at your disposal. The separate app for city guides is not as good (relatively few cities and not as accurate).
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5

Big help finding restaurants in my area.  Only problem I had, ever time I saved a restaurant to favorites, the app took me back to the  first page. If I had been on page 4 or 5, it was a nuisance. Other than that, I love it.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5
The perfect travel buddy
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 3
It would be nice if there was accessibility info listed and a filter for that. It's very difficult to travel with special needs and that information is really important to have on a travel app
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 3
Seems to find restaurants OK but the search feature is highly lacking. While in Chicago I searched for Attractions / Casinos. The search came up with New Jersey and an obscure hotel in Maine.  There are no less than 8 casinos within 50 miles of Chicago and this app missed EVERY one of them!
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5

I had the free app which I loved - it saved my travel spots and so easy to use. offer pops up to "upgrade" so I do that - turns out the upgrade is a "buy" so I hit "buy" thinking it will say how much. Nope. I still don't know how much it cost. Trying to search a vacation spot and when I went to look at 2d attraction, I had to type in the town again - if this keeps up, it will get old quick. And then, and this was their big mistake , while I'm aggravated, a pop up asks me to rate - ok - right now, I preferred my old free version over this.
Version 6.2 2012-07-01 5

I really like it most of the time.  Like having reviews of places we're not familiar with.  The only complaint I have is not being able to find campgrounds very well on this app.  We camp more than do hotels, and it's easier to find those surfing the web than the app.  It's still a useful app though!

Trip Advisor provides you with so many useful lists for lodging, food, and activities. The reviews are always very recent so it's reflective of what you will find right now. The format of the information allows you to save the items that interest you very easily. It's the best travel advice/discovery app I've found. I really appreciate their including so many activities - lots of sites do hotels and restaurants but not what to do. It's also nice it works on mobile and Web-based access devices.
Version 6.2 2012-06-30 5

The app is great for locating lodging...the problem is, many listings don't have any means of reserving, or even contact info for the facility, aside from address. 
For example, there are several properties in Wimberley, Texas that we're interested in, but have no way of checking availability, specific price, or calling operators. I understand that the app may have no control over this lack of detail, but I have to question the usefulness even including listings with no means of contacting or renting lodging.

So far I love being able to read reviews of places to eat and things to do. My only problem is that the rating system on the list page doesn't match the listings rating.
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 5
Easy to use very informative !
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 1
This app used to be awesome now I don't even understand how to get a proper list of restaurants in order by popularity.  It seems to be trying too hard to use the map feature and gives incomprehensible lists.  Bring the old app back please, this new update is awful!
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
It's a little slow at times. and tends to crash. and freezes. but other than that, it's a great app!
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
Love the app. I can check hotels, flights and a sundry of others when I need to.  I'm enjoying it immensely.
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
Great app. Love the rankings on things to do!

Made planning our vacation SO much easier!
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 1
If you don't know your airport codes then looking up a flight is useless. I guess tripadvisor expects you to know every 3 digit airport code. I'll stick with the skyscanner app which blows this out of the water.
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
Very good for all the reasons noted in reviews, but users should be aware that the app understandably cannot keep up with all recent closures and openings, so info occasionally outdated. Also sometimes misses key spots in local area even though in Trip Advisor database; for example, I recently asked for nearby shopping while standing in parking lot of one of the largest shopping malls in the state (since 2001), and the result showed nearest shopping mall to be 5 miles away. Thus good as a general guide, but cannot assume accuracy or completeness.
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 5
Very good app.
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
Great app!
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
Works great
Version 6.2 2012-06-27 4
Does what it intends - could be smoother transition when expanding reviews as you seem to loses your place momentarily.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 4
Used selectively, Trip Advisor is always a helpful trip planning aid. The mobile version is especially handy for "in the field" decisions about hotels, restaurants and activities.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 3
Glad to have it while traveling. But needs to include more types of lodging.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
Best vaca/restaurant app out there!
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
Every time we go on vacation, my husband and I wonder what people did in the days before this website/app. The reviews for hotels and restaurants are invaluable. We rarely go to a restaurant without checking them first. Having this app is like having a hotel concierge at your fingertips 24/7! There was a link to Open Table at one point so you could connect with one tap to make reservations, but I'm not seeing that anymore, unless I just haven't looked up restaurants connected with Open Table recently. I loved that feature. Again awesome app!
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 4
Easy to use the "hotel near me" feature.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 2
Sometimes useful but mostly frustrating with it always asking you to sign in via Facebook every time you enter app. And, bad luck if you accidentally tap 'yes' and enter Facebook sign in on iPad. There is no escape. 

Even though on iPad, the main site is still a better option. As the functionality and accuracy of the app are both weak.

Do yourself a favour. Avoid!
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 4
We have Trip Advisor a great help in planning vacations.  The app is good, although of the functions are awkward. We wished it better mirrored the website.  All in all though very good. Will stay on my iPad for sure.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 4
This is an awesome app!
Version 6.1 2012-06-25 5
I love trip advisor...especially the app. I can't imagine how I lived without it prior to it's existence, to be honest. The traveler photos are critical, all the information you need is right there in a clear and concise format, to make a quick and informed decision for your travel. You will not be disappointed.
Version 6.1 2012-06-25 4
Really like this app. I can quickly & easily find useful information quickly.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 4
I find this app very valuable and helpful in locating hotels and places of interest. The ratings are ver useful.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
I have used Trip Advisor for planning trips to NYC, Florence, ITALY, Prague, and Reyjkavik...have found it particularly helpful in choosing hotels...no bedbugs yet!!!
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
Great app!
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5
As I was planning our trip this app helped to find the best attractions along the way.

New to me but looks great maybe it can guide me to the right place , things getting real old here.
Version 6.2 2012-06-25 5

Never travel without checking trip advisor first !

Love my trip advisor, using everyday on our road trip in the southwest. Thanks!
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5
Live the reviews and ease of use.
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 1
Very glitchy sign up on iPad. Finally gave up.
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5
I use it all the time to stay up on hotels for my vacation spots. I have never had it crash or freeze works better then 90% of the apps out there. Love the reviews from actual customers along with pics.
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 4
I've found attractions I didn't know were close by some of my frequent destinations.
Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5

Version 6.2 2012-06-24 5
This app is perfect. I use it to plan all my trips.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 1
App is just a slower, crashier , and buggy version of the website (it's literally the website wrapped in an app)

But more annoyingly is every time you go to the website you're told to get the app. Hint: I'm on the website because the app is terrible.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I've been using Tripadvisor for a few years now to find good hotels. Nice to have it as an app, a very good resource.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I really enjoy reading real travelers reviews! I constantly refer to trip advisor for help in choosing hotels and places to go in new cities. This time I used the site to find the lowest airfare, too. I am happy there's an app and I like how the natives of the cities in Europe I will be visiting have put their input on it. I try to pay it back by reviewing the places I visit, too, especially if they have been wonderful or a must miss.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
Excelente Aplicacion para Los que AmamosViajar, conocer lugares diferentes y la buena Vida
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I really like this app because I am forced to book thru a third party travel agency. This travel agency books whatever we want but doesn't always have the latest up to date info I need.  With trip advisor I just plug in where I want to go, what hotel I want, and which rental car agency I want to use. 

Although I've only used it a few times, it has def helped me out. Especially when I needed to find a flight home.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
Very helpful
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
Whether you're traveling cross country or to a city an hour away, this app will fill you in in places off the beaten path, and things not to miss. I especially love it to find local restaurants that are popular.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I find this site better than Yelp in finding recommendation for restaurants, hotels, and attraction nearby. Would highly recommend relying on this site...
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
Works great!I have used it for years!
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I travel for business and pleasure roughly 20-25 days a month and find useful info on Trip Advisor for 95% of the places I go. It is good for business travel and essential for vacation travel.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
This app has become an integral part of our trip planning, both before, during, and after.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I'm able to post pics right away as I review the hotel I'm staying in. I choose hotels not by the professional pics only and it allows me to give credit to those hotels that go the extra mile
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
I have found tripadvisor to be extremely valuable in planning trips and vacations. The app works well and is a needed extension of the website.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5

I have it on my iPhone, and it is even better on the iPad.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
This app is helping me find the places off the beaten path. You don't need a huge marketing budget to get recognized by TripAdvisor and that's what I love. When I'm on the road I want to find the local spots that are unique gems. TripAdvisor is the best I've found for this.
Version 6.2 2012-06-23 5
A must have for tourism. Excellent reviews of many of the different amenities.

I refer to this app first when planning a trip. It has lots of information, maps, etc for virtually any place in the world. It certainly is a good starting point for your adventures!
Version 6.1 2012-06-20 3
When I look for a hotel on certain dates, I want to be able to sort the search by availability. But it is not possible. Basically, you sort by location and then you need to go to each specific hotel, enter your dates, check several partners sites and then to get disappointed because hotel is fully booked. It is a long and frustrating process.
The reviews of travelers and photos however are very helpful.
Version 6.2 2012-06-20 5
Great App with lots of reviews & even a price search.
Version 6.1 2012-06-20 5
Incredibly helpful
Version 6.2 2012-06-20 5
Works just like web app with addition of knowing your location. Very helpful and easy to use. Easy to plan trips at home and reference saved items with tablet or phone.

Recent update renders this app useless. It is unable to find my location. I am deleting this app.
Version 6.2 2012-06-20 5
has never let me down on hotels and places to eat..
Version 6.2 2012-06-20 4
Used it a few times and it came in handy. The reviews, I learned, are subjective. I chose a 7.0 hotel near SeaTac Airport, and were it not for the fact that I would have lost my money I would have walked out. Now I cross reference with Hotels.com for a more informed view before I plunk down my money. But the app itself? Great!
Version 6.2 2012-06-19 5
Great app
Version 6.2 2012-06-19 5
I just did a cross-country motorcycle trip and this app was amazing.  I would ride until I got tired and then hit Tripadvisor to find a hotel.  The reviews kept me from making some bad mistakes and helped me make some cool finds.
Version 6.1 2012-06-19 5
Lots of information and good interface.
Version 6.1 2012-06-19 5
We use Tripadvisor as our go to travel info sight.  We travel a fair amount and find great tips, as well as sharing our experiences.  We look for value rather than luxory.
Version 6.1 2012-06-19 5
I can't say enough great things about this app! I use it constantly at home in the USA and in Europe. Last summer we traveled through Italy with the help of Trip Advisor. It's the app I use most!

You shouldn't go anywhere without first consulting Trip Advisor. Honest reviews and great information source!

I wish the app had alternative forms of accommodations.  I was unable to look up B&Bs, vacation Rentals, or specialty lodging.  I could view theses on the website using Safari.  This leads me to believe they aren't getting all the other restaurant listings either.
Version 6.1 2012-06-19 4
Use this app every time I'm looking to take a trip.
Version 6.2 2012-06-19 5
Trip Advisor has been my go to guide for travels over the past few years. Spend some time reading all the reviews and then make your decision. Also know that different people have different ideas and needs in mind about their travels.  I do not leave home for a vacation without checking it out on Trip Advisor first.
Version 6.2 2012-06-19 2
Used to be able to make reservations with it. Not anymore. Not digging the map.

I always turn first to Trip Advisor for information when traveling or planning travel. I tell everyone about it. My only concern is that I find it a little difficult to explain to new users how to get into the Cruise Critic Roll Call and join a board
Version 6.2 2012-06-18 5
Love tripadvisor for researching places....this lets me research on the go.  Has proven valuable on vacation
Version 6.2 2012-06-18 5
I started using this app when we went on vacation and found it to be very helpful. It is great if you want to try new things but don't know anyone personally whose been to a particular place because with this app someone usually has and they can tell you about it.

Great Trip Advisor info, but it does not work like a native app. Pretty annoying.

Best travel app out there. Once their flights app gets incorporated, game over.
Version 6.2 2012-06-18 3
So every time I update the App, my saves disappear. I love that App feature but sooo frustrating. Also, why don't they have a saves feature on the website so I can see them online where I do my serious research and printing?
Version 6.2 2012-06-18 5
Quick and easy to use. Reviews help make or confirm decisions. Also like the 'Near Me Now' feature that helps find restaurants, etc., in unfamiliar territory.
Version 6.1 2012-06-17 4
I loved this app. I downloaded the Boston city guide, and it was really handy for finding restaurants and attractions. I love how you can search "find best nearby" to locate good places in your immediate area. I'm going to London later this year and I'm so glad I have this app; I think it'll come in handy again.
Version 6.1 2012-06-17 4

Version 6.1 2012-06-17 5
Always refer to TropAdvisor before I book a stay ANYWHERE!  <3 this ap!
Version 6.2 2012-06-17 3
The app works well, but there is an issue with the algorithm that determines which currency to show hotel prices on.  The currency is determined based on the language your device is set to.  I live in the USA, but I prefer British or UK English, so when I use the app, I have to change my language for hotel prices to show in USD.  The app should have a settings page with a currency selection option, it shouldn't be decided by the language used.

Aside from that, TripAdvisor is still the app I consult before deciding on any hotel to stay in.
Version 6.1 2012-06-17 4
Very user friendly app. It was easy to use and we found a great little motel right outside Ocean City N.J. Called the Boulevard Motel.
Version 6.2 2012-06-17 3
Overall extremely helpful however recent updates makes the app crash or not update the selections when you move the map.
Version 6.2 2012-06-17 5
Since downloading the TripAdvisor App for iPad, I have been using several times per week for business and pleasure.  I like the way I can get information on hotels, restaurants, flights, etc. in one place.  The user reviews are very helpful.

Version 6.2 2012-06-17 5
If you are like me and do a lot of travelling, planning every little detail can really drain the fun right out new places.  That is where this app is amazingly useful.  Just plug in your city or use the "near me now" function and find good places to eat, intersting places to see and so on.

Easy to use and reliable ! Love it
Version 6.2 2012-06-15 4
Great reviews and information.  Better than the mobile website.  However, a few limitations:
1) Most hotels it does not list phone, but sends you to Orbitz or Travelocity to make reservations.
2) Not all top sites are rated, but that is up to us users of the service to add them.
Version 6.2 2012-06-15 5
Accurate Reviews you can depend on. Don't make travel plans without doing your research here !  Highly recommended.

Version 6.0 2012-06-07 5
Love this website.
I am able see "real" reviews of hotels and destination from people like me. I love to travel, but need help finding the right vacation spot for the right price. This site has allowed me to post my reviews too. 

I know when I start a search, it will lead to a truly fun vacation.
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 4
Fun and very easy to use..
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 4
Easy to use and pretty darn fast wish there was a feature that would send reminders or updates of new flights or new pricing.
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 4
Excellent for hotels and restaurants. Less good for the sites because there are only reviews and no additional materials.
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 4
Let's you search vital information and make better travel decisions.
Version 6.1 2012-06-07 4
I'll give it five stars when they add the ability to filter the user photos by category like you can on the web. Other then that the app works perfect. Like having the web site in your pocket. I can't say that for many apps out there but this one truly brings the web experience in a concise GUI on a smart phone. Great job!

So far I am enjoying this app. Just installed yesterday and have gotten lots of additional info regarding our upcoming trip to Vancouver Island and Torfino and Vancouver. Glad I installed it, just for the reviews! It has helped with hotel choices.
Version 6.1 2012-06-06 4
It's a great app but need more categories so we can find hotels more easily.
Version 6.1 2012-06-05 5
Love this app, we have used it everyday of our vacation & it has been very helpful.

This was a great app before the forced update. Can't stand the  Bing maps, as finding locations of places has become more frustrating and slow. Still, good info- I always consult tripadvisor when I travel. I'll probably just use the website though.

Version 6.1 2012-06-05 5
Your travel experience start at the moment that you click the trip advisor icon, and definitely helps you, through the experience of thousands of people to make the best out of your trips, thanks for these great tool
Version 6.1 2012-06-05 3
Overall, a decent app., however, it has some shortcomings. The first one is that TA uses Bing, which is, as always with Microsoft products, far inferior to other mapping software (e.g. Google Maps). Second, it is sometime, if not often, difficult to display larger groupings, or even pages, of attractions or destinations. Third, there are sometimes issues with mapping over small areas - nothing shows on the map, for example, even thought there ought to be places. Finally, the ratings of various listings often seems inconsistent, especially where there aren't many reviews.

Otherwise, it is generally attractive and has a fair amount of information if you're willing to wade through the deficiencies.
Version 6.1 2012-06-05 5

This app has saved me from making a lot of bad choices while on the road for work.  Comforting to know I can trust it and take customers and guests to tried and true places...did I forget to mention that I no longer have to rely on the hotel staff for suggestions?!  This app is indispensable!

Trip advisor has been so helpful to me and my family when we travel to place we've never been to before. I have really relied on other peoples opinions on hotels.

I love this app. I've learn more about my city and activities to do. Best of all it helps me plan trips close to home.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
The near me now feature is awesome. It so quick to help you find a place to eat. My only complaint is the distance to the  restaurant seems off a little. Not enough to make this less than a 5 star app though.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 4
As an avid traveler, trip advisor is one of the tools I use in deciding on travel. It gives you great idea of location and price so yo can narrow down to the options you are serious about. I get hesitant about the reviews sometimes but all in all this app is perfect or the avid or casual traveler.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
My favorite restaraunt in Atlantic City. A true Italian menu with great service. The quality of all food is excellent
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 4
The app could stand tweaking. The information could be a little better. When you put pics on these things, a picture of the outside is good, pictures of what the food looks like when it comes can be as important as the pictures of the inside and outside of the building.
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5
Never do anything or travel without checking tripadvisor first!
Version 6.1 2012-06-03 5

I always use TripAdvisor when traveling to a new city.  Most of the reviews are accurate.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
The Trip Advisor App is sooooo helpful!  It is great with directions and suggestions on things to do at your destination.
Couldn't do without it!
We Have used it recently on trips to Cambodia and to France for hotels, B and B's and restaurants.  The suggestions were "right on" and saved us lots of research time.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 4
I love this app. It's great because it lets you use your current location. Perfect for those last minute trips and adventures. However, I'd like it a lot better if the map feature would open in my Maps application. That way getting directions would be faster.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
Trip Advisor is the only way to go! Very helpful when needing to find a new destination . Cheers!

Use Trip Advisor on every trip and when looking a restaurant near home. For hotels, I tend to stick to chains where I get points but do look for hotels that are very close to specific locations or are especially interesting, nice or quirky. For restaurants I avoid the chains and look for something that is local. I do wish that there was a "chain" filter.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
Easy to find new places to eat, easy the write reviews..

This is my go to app for travel and/or things to do where I'm at!  Excellent
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 4
This app is truly a wonderful tool. 

My only complaint is that one can't add a restaurant that is not already listed. I often eat at great places that are not on TA, so I can't rate them. 

That being said, Most good restaurants are already added.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 3
A well informed app ..
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 5
Used continually to see pictures and opinions of hotels and sites to see!
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 3
It has potential, and is still informational, but it is very buggy. For example, clicking your saves will open up a random location in the list instead of the list itself. And often it will say it can accurately map a location even with an address. The map as stated in other reviews is not great. A little more work and this could be great.
Version 6.1 2012-06-02 4
I use this all the time since I travel for work. Top rated restaurants and reviews are extremely helpful.

We use this for both business and pleasure. We find the reviews very helpful and appreciate the personal opinions and comments. Very easy to use. I haven't figured out how to add a site and write a review but I have tried to add reviews on most of the sites that we visited that are already on here.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 1
Country inn and suites did not pick us up, as paid for. The night manager would not answer the phone, and I called 9 times!! We were at N.O. airport for more than 30 mins, calling and calling!! Ended up taking a taxi, and was treated so rude, and refused to stay there the night . So, at one in the morning, we drove back to baton rouge!! We were told to call the owner/manager in the morning, and she was very ugly about the situation . Refusing to reimburse any monies. The man, who did not answer our calls told us that , this happens all the time. He also told us the people over him, did not give a !?@!!! Really? Don't trust them to transport you to or from the airport!!! THUMBS DOWN!!!!! On a scale of 1 to 10, they get -10!!!!
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 5
I use this app all the time I find a lot of great food because of it. I just wish they market to more businesses, I live in south Florida and I can never find anything young people would find fun. I only 23 add some clubs bars and things not easily found. Regardless this app is awsome.

It's a great resource and easy to use. 
One of my favorite features is to see traveler's photos to get a real feel of a location.

I use to never do this type thing but I write my reviews while I am in the establishment if at all possible. And I have shown my review to some owners and managers from my table.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 1
Loaded app on iPad2.  Wrote a medium length review and couldn't get signed in so sent for a password reset.  Review disappeared while signing in again.  I love writing reviews twice.  I want to do that all the time.

It's also hard to get back to the settings screen.  You get in home screen and have to hit My Saves to get the settings button.  Tooo weak.  I'll stick with the browser site.
Version 6.1 2012-06-01 5
We travel a great deal since we retired and are so glad that we have such a great resource as Tripadvisor. We rarely go out without consulting Tripadvisor before booking a hotel, restaurant, or tour. Tripadvisor is a must have application and I recommend it to all my friends and family.

Version 6.1 2012-05-30 4
Not a bad app
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 2
This is a pretty bad app compared to the website. There is no way when looking up hotels to look by availability. You have to search hotels first, pick the hotel and the see if they are available when you want. It is terribly inefficient. If you know the hotel you are interested in and want to look up I Infomation about that hotel, then the app is very helpful. It is not an app to use to search for available hotels on a certain date or dates. Stick to the website. Hopefully they will make a better app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5
Has everything one can think of to look up where ever you are great app
Version 6.1 2012-05-30 5

I trust this review site more than any other. Trip Advisor has never steered me wrong.  I hope you're around for many years to come TA!
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 4
For the most part, app works as intended. When I write reviews and then navigate to another app, the review disappears and I am returned to the home screen. 
Fortunately, it saved my review data so I didn't have to re-enter it.  But still disorienting and inconvenient. Otherwise, no other major gripes yet.

As for Trip Advisor service as a whole - I love it, and their website has been one of my primary sources of info for global travel for more than 4 years now. Thanks, TripAdvisor!
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 1
Used to be a frat app: but something very wrong with the near me now functionality. Despite 10 local restaurants on tripadvisor.com in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, near me now in the app only finds one...

Glacier Wa has perhaps 200 residents and according to this app, 300 restaurants. I guess the app cannot be relied upon for accuracy.
Version 6.1 2012-05-29 5
Great app from A to Z

Good app for quick access to hotels.

TRUE STORY: I once dated a higH fashion model who excused herself to use the 'Cat box'.  Five minutes later, a waiter slipped me a note from two giggly girls. They wanted to go out with me. What utterly crushed my ego was the Reason they wanted to go out with me. I was told my date was so cultured and beautiful that I had to be rich else connected to have a woman like that to be seen in public with the likes of me!!!

Substitute coffee for the model I dated and that is the coffee at Temple (2 DT Sacto locations).  When was the last time you quaffed coffee made by a top rated US coffee bar? As a coffee Gourmonde, I have impossibly high standards---but not like a single varietal Ethopean Yrgecheff espresso !!! 

For a lousy $3.50, I can call Donald Trump and sniff Jamacian Blue Mountain coffee---kinda slumming this morning, aren't we Donny? For a lousy $3.50 I can quaff an expertly crafted expresso I could never make at home from the finest coffee chain (2 stores) in America.  How many opportunities do you have to think you are better than everyone else for a lousy $3.50?!!! 
Enjoy your coffee with the terminally hip dozens of Sacramento and make snide remarks about Starbucks patrons!!!

I use TripAdvisor primarily to chose hotels and restaurants while traveling. It's great to have a realistic idea of what I can expect.
Version 6.1 2012-05-28 5
More often than not TripAdvisor has steered me away from bad places and towards good ones, whether it's a hotel or a restaurant. Only lately have I started giving ack by adding my own reviews ...

Rented scooters from A&M for memorial weekend. This was the third time my husband and I have been to the keys and rented scooters. They have been by far the best to rent from. They let us have the scoots from 10am Friday to 4 pm Sunday with only 2 day charge. Others wanted us to pay for an extra day if we did not return in exactly 48 hours. A&M also picked us up from the airport and dropped us back off free of charge.  They were also the best price I could find on the island. They also rent electric cars and bikes. Be sure to check them out.
Version 6.1 2012-05-27 4
There's no "free lunch" so do not try eating this app but it's worth keeping for sure.

Cool app, very helpful! :)
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
I was looking for a hotel in the outer banks, but all google maps was showing me was creepy dangerous places.  Trip advisor guided me to a Pawnshop that didn't ask questions and that night I slept safely with a 12 gauge next to me!  Thanks!
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
Love it!
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
Rarely inaccurate. Usually spot on.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
The only way to write up your own itinerary, book your hotels and feel confident that you don't get a lemon!  Best to read all the reviews.  This IS my favorite website along with their city guides...Love it. :). :)
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
Love the app
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
Fast easy and very informative way of getting the inside scoop on places before u go there. Use your own judgement when believing some of the reviews. But at least this is a great place to get some good ideas beyond the advertisements.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
Love this app!  Used it for the first time and it is wonderful.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
Great to read and rate the tours I like to go on! Great app
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
Fabulous
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 3
I much prefer the iPhone app to the iPad so that I can see things in list form rather than on the map and then have to try to sort everything out. I like the map as an option but not as default. Also, the rankings differ from the full version online.....very misleading to a potential visitor of a place!
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
This is a must have for travelers. The reviews are as helpful, if not more, than a guide book.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
Very nice;)
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
So far so good, pretty straight forward and seems to work like should

Very good
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5
I've been using this app in comparison to my computer and it's easy to use and the prices quoted on the app appear to be cheaper than the online prices. I'll be booking the hotel and plane shortly so I'll know for sure later. So far it's amazing and convenient!
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 1
Most reviews are false. I'd not use their reviews when looking for hotels.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
Works very well.  Easy to use and provides good location information and options.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
It's very easy to use & was very useful in planning our trip to Italy last minute.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 4
This app is very good, no kidding. It helps plan trips any where in the world, tells you where and what to see, highlights and grads hotels for you at a glance including there prices what more can you ask for?  A crystal ball? Personally I like this app.

Don't like that I have to view Landscape.  And it just doesn't seem to be as intuitive as the normal website.
Version 6.1 2012-05-24 5

I am using TripAdvisor service a lot however this iPad app is a disappointment:
- user's Saves seem to be stored locally on iPad only, there is no way to see what I saved in iPad from iPhone app or website. It has been an unpleasant surprise for me as I planned my trip on iPad but when I went abroad on holiday, I could only have internet connection on my phone. So I had to purchase separate sim with data plan for ipad.
- the ui is often unresponsive (probably because the app is just a wrapper for tripadvisor.com website, not a fully native iOS app)
- filter settings are constantly reset. It is very annoying that I have to specify again that I want a b&b rather than a hotel with each new search
 
There are a lot of smaller glitches in this app too. I hope developers will take into account users feedback, looking forward for update
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 4
Love the app, but when I was looking for a dive company I had to search the exact name to find any.
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
Love the helpful app and fantastic pics of future places to visit.
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
Trip advisor is the best app for anyone planning a vacation or even just interested in a particular area! I never fail to find the perfect place to stay when I use this app!
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
It's very helpful in finding hotels, Resturaunts and things to do.
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 5
Found that this app is very helpful for planning vacations, locating restaurants, and seeing real pictures of hotels.   Awesome app. A must have for any traveler.
Version 6.1 2012-05-22 1
Hotel listing does not include B&Bs,website does...please. Fix

Good app, you find exactly what you want
Version 6.1 2012-05-21 2
Like the previous post, I want to love this app, but I can't...too many bugs. I can't access my TA account, not all places listed on website are available on the app-site (why/how is that possible?). I couldn't even find where or how to contact TA. Please fix this app so it is workable!
Version 6.1 2012-05-21 5
Very useful.  Have found evaluations, after visiting the establishments, accurate.  Some users over evaluate; some under evaluate.  Some evaluators do not evaluate accurately.  It is important to weight recent users scores higher.  It's world wide cover is a major plus. I consider this app as a "Best Available Evaluation Tool."
Version 6.1 2012-05-21 3
I want to love this app - it has great info, and looks gorgeous. 

Unfortunately it's riddled with bugs. It constantly loses your place in lists; the feature to save starred attractions is worthless because half the items saved to lists don't work; frequently panes don't update as you tap in different locations, etc. 

I'd recommend people keep an eye on it, because when the bugs are fixed it will be a spectacular app. But right now, we are a long way from that.
Version 6.1 2012-05-21 3
For those of us that are interested in our trip advisor account, where is it?

How do I log in?

Where do I submit a review?

The app is  good keep improving it.

Version 6.1 2012-05-21 5
Great app for travel planning and to see what is in the area of your destination.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Great app, easy to use and plenty of reviews. Using it to plan a trip to the DC area this summer and I've learned which places to avoid. Thanks!
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
What makes this app different is a) it works really well, is simple to navigate, and interfaces with google maps, and) b it's written by the people who use it. I have used trip advisor for ablest the past two years, and travel at least20 times a year. With one exception, one restaurant in Paris, the reviews have been very accurate, helpful, and made our trips, both business and vacation, so much better. thanks for the app, but most of all thanks to all the people who take the time to write reviews!
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
This app provides me with all the information that I need to make decisions of my travels from those that have done it before
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
This a very reliable and comprehensive source for rated hotels, attractions and restaurant. A+++
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 4
The app is good to find information about hotels, things to do, and restaurants. In this app you can also see photos from travelers and experience fist hand how things (hotel's rooms, lobby, outdoors) really are. I totally recommend it.

This is a great easy to use App and helps me to quickly and efficiently post reviews on places I have visited, restaurants I have dined at and hotels that I have stayed at.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 4
This is a very goo App which we use frequently while traveling. Would like to a feature which would give me directions and a map from where I am. Maybe I,m missing something.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
This app pretty much let's you do everything the website will, and it's very easy to navigate.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 2
I figure an app should give you a lot more than accessing the same website with a browser. This one doe not.

It's harder to sort your searches. I can't seem to find out how to mark a review as helpful. I can't seem to write a review and I can't access my Tripadvisor profile. The only enhancement I see is the "nearby" search, accessing my iPad's location, but that is just not enough.

Try again.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 3
Constantly crashing. Very annoying because you have to start all over.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Excellent website for travelers
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 2
The reviews are auto translated. They are so bad that it is just annoying to read. Don't use it anymore because of this. Web page much better.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Very useful app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Better than the iPhone app!  Intuitive and easy to use, which is key when you're in an unfamiliar city and are scrambling to find somewhere to eat or stay!
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Love using this app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 1
I've found that the Tripadvisor app is not updating forum posts in real time.  Also, it doesn't seem possible to post question/response using the app? Also doesn't display frequently asked questions like the web page.
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 5
Excellent app
Version 6.1 2012-05-20 4
Good enough app, no compliants...

Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
It's a great tool to help with hotels in cities where you are not familiar. Planned a trip to Europe and only made one bad hotel choice based on viewer feedback. Several hotels absolutely fabulous; I would never have found them without trip advisor. Thank you to all who provide truthful and candid reviews!
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5

Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
Whenever I want to travel I can always refer to this app to give me ideas on where to go and what to do! I strongly recommend you get it.
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 3
I love to use Trip Advisor to find things to do, hotels and restaurants for places I'm traveling to, but when trying to look through the listings and seeing where they are on the map, the map and lists keep resetting back to the original view which is very frustrating because you keep losing your place and have to start over again.  This makes it really to difficult to use for more than just casually browsing for ideas.  Then you have to switch to a real PC browser or different app to do more research.  Disappointing because if this worked correctly this would be a great app to find everything you need for travel all in one place.
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
Great tool for quick comparison snapshot of competing DMOs.
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
We like to take Roadtrips and don't know quite where we will end up for the night.  This app is great for when you roll into a new town and don't know what accommodations are there. It shows you all the hotels and motels on a map.  You can zoom in to see the details of the location.  You can sort by price or popularity, and when you have found the one you want, just book it.
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 5
Is the best !!!!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-19 4
Thank you Trip Advisor, your reviews helped in deciding where to stay and where to eat!  We had 12 wonderful nights in hotels / bed & breakfast recently in England and will use you again for our next trip.   The App was used constantly to make our vacation plans and will be used in the future!!!  :  )

My first review took over a week to get approved but it's a useful app. and I find myself using it all the time.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 4
The TripAdvisor app is very easy to use, clean design, and makes it more likely that I'll actually write a review.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
I love Trip Advisor and this app rocks!  Very handy and easy to use.  Looks amazing on my iPad!
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
great app very surprised.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
Very helpful to get the point of view of others before booking hotels, or visiting restaurants.
Version 6.1 2012-05-18 5
Has everything I need and is among the most responsive travel apps I use regularly.
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
This made my Paris trip much more enjoyable. The best are the city guides and the "point the way" compass. So helpful in a foreign land. I also love the traveler photos and reviews. I feel I can trust them more.
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
Wouldn't go anywhere or stay anywhere  without checking. Tripadvisor first
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 4
This is a great app for the iPad. Quick access to anything, anywhere. Planing a trip to Cape Cod & Wildwood, NJ in the very near future. I will do all of it on the go, searching for a good WiFi has become my passion in life!
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
Trip Advisor always gives me the spot on advice on where to stay and what's located near the site! Thanks!
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
Use for every trip I take!  Great app
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5

Great app for planning travels, information Is top notch, app itself is nothing spectacular
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
great app!  Has helped my travels a lot!
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
I come to Trip Advisor whether I'm gong to a restaurant down the street or to a destination 1000s of miles away!  I trust the recommendations to give me the best info.
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
Great app!
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
We plan our vacations based on this app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
TripAdvisor provides up to date reviews from actual travelers spending their hard earned cash so their opinions can be trusted more than any hotel website - the key is for users to follow suit with their own reviews to keep the database current; the reviewer photos are often more true to life than the photoshopped   professional ones
Version 5.9 2012-05-17 5
I cant do it anymore... Its great
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 3
As far as apps go, this is not a bad one. It looks good and seems pretty efficient, but there are some quirky issues from time to time. Like the back button looks out of place and doesn't take you back pages, just moves. Also, it generally uses google maps, but on some pages randomly uses Bing. I'm not even sure the TripAdvisor people know this because the Bing maps don't work at all.

All in all, the app works, but its nothing special.
Version 6.1 2012-05-17 5
Great app. Convenient and thorough and the people of TA have never advised me wrongly.
Version 6.1 2012-05-14 4
Still Needs more functionality
Version 6.1 2012-05-14 5
As a travel agent, this ap is very useful when I am away from the office. Great
 to pull up info and pics to show clients.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Trip Advisor is the bomb dot com!
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 4
Found trip advisor very useful in uncovering out of the way surprises.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 4
Just loaded the app and have only use it for a little while, but so far, so good.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Best vacation planning tool available.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Worked great
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Works great, is a little slow but has great information.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Use this app all the time as I travel a lot for both work and pleasure. Dependable performance and intuitive design.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 3
The app is easy and intuitive to navigate, and I like it, save for a few drawbacks:

Photos don't link back to their reviews, and almost every time I switch to another app then back, the app does not keep my history but puts me on the main search page.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 4
Like most functions but could improve rating system and include option for directions when using map.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Wonderful
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 4
The new version is slow
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 4
great app when you don't plan that far in advance
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
I never take a trip without consulting TripAdvisor. And I've always found the reviews helpful. I've discovered many gems I wouldn't have visited if I hadn't used this app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Hotels and customers need to know before you sign in.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 2
Used to work great but now it won't even get me passed the homepage without crashing. I even re-downloaded it and it still crashes. PLEASE FIX!!! It used to be a 5 star app but noe it gets 2 until this problem is fixed.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
Love having all this info at my fingertips
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 4

Great
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 3
Overall TripAdvisor is still helpful, but I'm very disappointed in the app update! I lost all my old saves and find it much less user-friendly. Wish I could go back to the old app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-13 5
I love reading the reviews and seeing the pics taken by real travelers. There are no attempts to make a small room look deceptively large :)
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 4
Nice interface, simple organization, and good means to plan any trip!
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
I love being able to see reviews and photos from actual travellers.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 4
Really helps mitigate the number of times you eat at a crap restaurant...
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 4
It was a big surprise when I first started using this app. It is much faster to find a hotel using this app, the only con for me is the fact that the app do not maintain your navigation when you leave it and return. E.g. I set a lot of filter options (price range, hotel star rate, etc), and if I have to leave the app for any reason, when i come back I have lost all settings and must do all over again.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 1
Now it lists locations that are not there, places that don't exist and there is no way to navigate anymore. This app used to have a live camera view. It is now gone. Useless app. Deleted
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
Love this app when planning trips to europe
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
I would recommend it!!!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 3
Limits to only hotel search, vice bed and breakfast or vacation rentals which the website can do. A little watered down but useful on the go for quick hotel or attraction reviews. Please upgrade this app to a fully functional tripadvisor.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
No matter where we travel to, I count on this app for tours, eats and more. I get all my information in one place instead of visiting multiple websites. Love it and very accurate.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 1
New version is not an improvement!!!!!!   Won't even open.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
Trip Advisor for the iPad is like being the owner of a travel agency. Obviously, your final travel arrangements will always depend of the innumerable tricks used by the service provider (the airlines are the trickiest!), but with Trip Advisor you are very well equipped for the challenge!
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
Lots of useful info with fairly accurate info. Must have app when traveling
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 4
I have been using TripAdvisor for several years for hotels. The past two years I starting using it for restaurants. No I can do all this on my phone with the App. Sweet!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
Why would you NOT use others' help when choosing restaurants or travel options?  It's what these smartphone devices are made for - staying connected.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 4
I used this mostly to search for local restaurant in my area. Very convenient n gave lots of information in detail.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
Useful
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
I use this app for all travels.  Great for restaurants and hotels.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
I love this app it helps me locate tons of things to do when I'm on vacation.
Version 6.1 2012-05-12 5
I use this exclusively for restaurants and places to stay. I've never been led astray. Thanks for making my vacas the best.
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 4
The TripAdvisor app is a great tool for those on vacation.  The mapping features come in handy, showing points of interest as you drive.  I wish it had the full functionality of the webs site, but this is not a complaint, just a wish for the future.
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 5
Since downloading the app we use it before we dine out. Great to read reviews before going out. A great aid. Thanks
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 4
Love this app. Use it often to locate restaurants. Rarely let's me down - although I have had a few 'bum steers'!
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 5
I enjoy the site. Please add your review. A few don't give a true picture of a place. Gripes and the overly enthusiastic can dominate on just a few reviews
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 5
Use this whenever I travel and have found some great restaurants
Version 6.0 2012-05-11 5
This app rocks my world... :)
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 5
Using app for the first time.  Ratings are dead on so far and very helpful for researching travel plans.
Version 6.1 2012-05-11 5
The web browser version of Trip Advisor is quite handy, and I have used it quite a bit, but I think this iPad version may be even nicer.  Well worth downloading for the would-be traveler!  Also take a look at the iPad version of Kayak, which I have found to be a great program for choosing flights.
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 1
Can't find major nearby restaurants. Forces you to use landscape orientation on iPad. You're better off just using the website.
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 4
Comprehensive list of hotels and restaurants for every place I needed.
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 5
Love this app.  Let's you tell others about your experience and also let's me find out what to expect at a destination.  Very helpful when planning a trip.

Invaluable travel planning tool.
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 5
Helps us by the reviews of the places we like to find when we are out of town, because the customers know!!!!
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 4
Overall, this app works pretty well. One of the reasons I sometimes  prefer the website rather than the app is because bookmarking hotels is not convenient. For example, whenever you save a hotel (by marking it with a star), the list goes all the way back to the beginning, making it difficult to see exactly where you left off. As example, if there's a total of 50 results and you happen to bookmark  #41 to your favorites, upon doing so the page automatically goes all the way back to result #1, which is a pain in trying to find where you left off, especially since they're not numbered.
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 5
I use it whenever I travel
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 5
Awesome in the go
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 5
I recommend getting this app, it's very helpful in finding things to do in new cities, countries, etc.
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 5
I'm hooked.  Great way to plan a really good getaway, excursions and special evenings. You get the good and the bad ratings all in one place along with visitors' photos and even maps to help you find your way around someplace new.  Use it and give feedback based on your own experiences to make it better for everyone!
Version 6.1 2012-05-09 2
When I add something to "saved" it resets the search results to page 1. Also doesn't show all results. For example, while searching for hotels in DC, it only provided 50 results. I like the layout though
Version 6.1 2012-05-08 4
Very good tool mainly because the reviews!
Version 6.1 2012-05-08 2
Photos don't work.  I love trip advisor but not this app.

It works better than the web page
Version 6.1 2012-05-08 5
Very handy for locating the best places!
Version 6.1 2012-05-08 3
Many establishments are correcting their issues upon bad reviews
But still paying the negative impact long ago as tripadvisor keep reviews for years, it should offer option to remove reviews after 1 year or after specific issues have been corrected
Version 6.1 2012-05-08 5
Very helpful. I should have used it more on our recent trip.
Version 6.1 2012-05-08 5

Version 6.1 2012-05-08 3
I look at places I know and read the reviews and realise we ALL have an opinion so take it with a healthy grain of sea salt. Wish it was easier to ADD to places. You still have to decide for yourself but it helps.

Great app, use it much for comparisons and research for trips very helpful!  Love to travel so a must.  Thanks!
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 3
Generally, this is a good app. Sometime, its hotel ratings are suspect. For example, a highly rated one in Clovis, CA, overlooks a junkyard! The Clovis Cole Best Western, rated poorly, has the best location in town yet is set back from any street noise by a large, shaded parking lot. Otherwise, I have had a good experience using this app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
Good information
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 4
But some times deliver wrong information on map about distance

I love the app it's very handy for me as a frequent traveller. Great app
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 3
Overall the app is great. One thing that bothers me though is that there is no "share" button so I can send via email or text message their listings. That is a big drawback to me. But, anyway, enjoy the rest of the features. I still like the app.
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
It's hard for me to even imagine how they could make this app any better!
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
Downloaded the app since I use the online version. Works just as good!
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
I used this app during my recent visit to Austin....it is on the dot about getting my expectations right at each location it mentioned

Simply amazing
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 4
This is a great app!  Very useful
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 3
I have just started using it and how can one rate it without using it much. So I thought let me be done with the rating process. Give users some time to use before rating. Phew!
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
I like food. I use this app to narrow down sites I want to visit while on the road, which I do frequently. Also, I have written many reviews after visiting so that others might see. You can get a nice 'feel' for a place by reading multiple reviews. I have not been to one restaurant in which the bulk of reviews were out of line with my experience. Saves me time and frustration!
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
I love the reviews and user uploaded photos. Makes it easier to research, especially hotels!
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 5
Absolutely phenomenal site. So much better than the reg website, and that's saying a lot!
Version 6.1 2012-05-07 4
...I could access my account.  Otherwise, a very good app! Also, on a few occasions I have noticed that hotels and restaurants are incorrectly marked on the map.  Much easier to use on the iPad.
Version 6.1 2012-05-06 5
The first App I look at when traveling to a new town. Great Job!!!!

Great Resource
Version 6.1 2012-05-04 2
New interface is based on map area which is fine except when you select a "place" (i.e., hotel/restaurant/attraction).  The app then re-centers/resizes the map based on your selection and presents a new, smaller, list of places.  Also seems that no matter what map view is selected, the list of places in incomplete.

This new interface may provide a little more information and some other aspects of the interface may be better, overall the older versions of this app were much easier to use.
Version 6.1 2012-05-04 5
I highly recommend this app, it's very helpful when you are traveling and looking for info on where to stat, eat etc.
Version 6.1 2012-05-04 5

We use trip advisor regularly while traveling and have found amazing food, hotels, and things we love to do along the way and avoided some unpleasant mistakes. It's great to have a variety of information, someone usually has added the pieces that are important to us. Love that. BUT 1. When searching, every time It returns to the map it puts me somewhere in the Atlantic and I would rather be back on the map where I was. 2. I find incorrect or incomplete information and have no way of submitting corrections. 3. It puts me back on the home page for no apparent reason and I have to start all over. I really like being able to save locations, but it's too annoying having to go to the page to save something knowing I'm going to end up in the Atlantic and have to start all over. Thanks for a nearly excellent app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
Great app for the iPad, easy to use, and very useful!
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
This app provides the most accurate reviews.  It is easy to plan days or just travel and tour sporadically with this app set to "Things to do near me now". 
The hotels have been just what I expected after reading the reviews.  I like the true to life pictures posted by the travelers. They tell the unvarnished truth about the hotel and the rooms in a way you cannot get from a brochure from the hotel itself.  Five stars for the real stories!
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
My husband and I used this app during our entire honeymoon. It's super fast & easy to use. So much so, that I still use it all the time & I'm a senior contributer!
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
Great travel app!  Puts the information and everything you need to know right in front of you.
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
Nice app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
Check in often when planning a trip or on vacation!
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
Great app!
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
Used it to plan an anniversary trip and found it to be extremely helpful. Love that there were so many pictures of the sites!
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 5
I have found the reviews to be so helpful! I even check them when eating in my own city.
Version 6.1 2012-04-29 3
One used to be able to map directly. Now you have to go through Bing, ads, etc. Please shift it back the way it was.
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
very nice app
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
We use this site before traveling anywhere. Well trusted
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 4
Good love it handy on my finger tip
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 4
Seems to be quite a few kinks.... Hopefully will get some fixes soon!
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
Trustable reviews!
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
I use this App for personal and business. When I want to share with others what hotel we are staying at I have to leave the app and search the hotel and THEN email a link. Having a share option would be great
Thank you for a real nice way to find hotels and restaurants !
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
One of the best apps I have used so far.  Quickly provides all the information in a easy layout on many popular vacation destinations! Love it!
Version 6.1 2012-04-28 5
I have just gotten into tripadvisor & really loved the reviews and suggestions that are available. The forum has been a great way to get questions answered.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 1
Very misleading if you happen to pick restaurants in smaller cities by the top number of stars. One has to assume that a number of the breathlessly fawning reviews were simply done by shills. We have consistently been steered wrong by Trip Advisor. 

In one case, the one accurate review was  allowed by Trip Advisor to be rebutted by the restaurant in question. The restaurant trashed the reviewer in a personal way and made several statements that were rank lies (my friends and I had had an identical experience). There's no chat or respond function so when this happens the reviewer (ie, the person who bought this app) can't defend themselves. 

The bottom line is that they have to actually hire a staff to verify their ratings or find a way to eliminate bogus reviews by friends and family that make Trip Advisor unreliable.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 5
This app has been incredibly useful on the recent trips I've taken. Ratings are spot on and its simple to use. Love it!
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 3
Decent app but you can not access the photos.  Hopefully there will be an update soon.
Version 6.1 2012-04-26 5
Good app
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 4
Very useful
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 1
No pictures from travelers makes the app useless!
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 2
Good for a quick browse, but need more filter options for hotels.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 5
I enjoyed reading the reviews. It helps me choose a good hotel and restaurant.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 2
Don't like new format. Not as user friendly, no maps?
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 1
Downloaded this app specifically to have the convenience of looking through pictures.. But the pictures dont show up. Must fix this!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 5
App work great and is easy to use.  Finds thing to do, places to stay an places to eat wherever you go
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 2
Mapping feature not functional on IPhone - makes Trip Advisor much less useful
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 1
The whole point I downloaded the App was to view traveler photos and I can't! USELESS until fixed.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 1
Add pictures and will give more stars.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 1
The new version does not permit viewing of traveler photos of hotels, which is one of the most important functions of Tripadvisor, in my view. Should return to the old version.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 4
My only beef is that not all of the places found (specifically restaurants) were mapped. Otherwise very user friendly. Like the link to the place's website too.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 5
Very useful and user friendly.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 4
Use this app on every trip.  Not sure what everyone did before it!
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 5
OMG I would normally stay a lot of other places but we started checking my husband in there for just a few hours rest being a Truck Driver and SALINAS GOOD NITE INN was great for rest, parking, and clean!!!! Great stay and courteous staff! Thanks Tobias for faxing too!
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 5
Great tool to have when traveling.
Version 6.1 2012-04-25 4
Very useful for travelers. Wish it has more suggestions for activities nearby
Version 6.1 2012-04-24 5
The best app ever!
Version 6.1 2012-04-24 5
Use it all!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-24 5
Please get the pics back! Otherwise very handy app. Great reviews and photos from all types travelers!!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-24 4
Like that I can compare hotels.com, expedia and others for best price. Keeps you from searching all the sites.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
Hasn't steered me wrong yet. Great app. Great website.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
Love finding new things and love contributing.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
I love using this! It has so many easy and great features!
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
It's great to be able to see user submitted photos of hotels, but the app has some annoying quirks with the search functionality, maps, etc.  it is helpful to use it along side some other trip planning apps.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
I use this app all the time, especially when  unfamiliar with a destination I have never been to. Saves a lot of time and energy in doing research. Mainly, you should use this to avoid the misery of staying in bad lodging!
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
Works just a good as the online version.  Comes in handy while traveling.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
Highly recommended - I find this App so useful to find good places to stat, eat and visit in my travels worldwide..the more that use it, the better it gets.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 2
When using the map to search for accommodations hotels just come and go. Hotels I just looked at 2 minutes earlier are now gone and don't return. On the left tool bar why does it say #2 of 10 but I only see 3 listings?
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
Would be great if you could zoom on the pics, though.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
Often times you only know how nice a place is by reading what folks had to say about a place. This is a good app for that.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
Great
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
I use it
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
Fun to use for places I am thinking about visiting.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
Very convenient to have on iPhone when traveling
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
I travel a lot this app is great !! It's a tourism guide right on your phone !!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
Great functionality for quick checks.  Love having it on the iPad.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
Still like using Trip Advisor on my pc better than this app, but when travelling it's easy to use!
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 4
Even when my desktop is available, I prefer to pull out the iPad and search on it. Map search lets me see what's nearby and where things are relative to my itinerary. Sometimes I can find a cheaper place a little further down the road.
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
:)
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
Be smart try this app
Version 6.1 2012-04-21 5
So useful, and free!
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 2
Lo siento
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 4
I'd be lost without access to Trip Advisor.  The app works well and provides me the information I need.  What more could you want?
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
If you like Trip Advisor on the web you'll probably find this app pretty useful. It's a great research tool.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 4
I always check Trip Advisor before booking a hotel but, having the app on my iPad has made the process of searching for a place to stay so much better, I don't have to wait until I get home, I just whip out my iPad while on my lunch break or at the salon waiting or getting my hair done and get my search on for upcoming trip. Time saver!
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
Great app
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 1
he new app is really awful....i want the old one back
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
A great way to get to know other places!
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 4
The app works fine. I've only been working with it for a couple of weeks. A couple of things I noticed that could be improved are:
1) the tool does not work with the gyroscope, and
2) it gives results of flight searches fixed outbound and inbound pairs of flights which makes searching a little slower.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
Helpful thanks a lot.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
Great app. It has a great flow to go from one view to another. Really helpful
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 2
I love this app on my iPhone and computer but the iPad did not live up to my expectations. I was searching in the map view and it was very difficult to navigate if you wanted to toggle through a few options.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
First place I look before going anywhere!  Great and useful app!
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
Super usefull! I can't stop finding helpful tips. Usually use it to find references of hotels and restaurants while planning or enjoying a visit to a new destination.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 1
This new version forces you to landscape mode on the iPad.  Emails to tech support asking why have gone unanswered.  Once you sign in with this app, it tracks everything you look at and basically starts to spam you with lots of junk about the place.

I like the service that TA offers but I don't like this app.  It has no settings of any kind, especially privacy.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 3
The web site s so much better. At the constant prodding of trip advisor web site to download the app on my iPad, I finally did it.  I am deleting it and sticking with the web site.  Love trip advisor, the app is not user friendly at all.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
I enjoy using this app. I do alot of traveling, and this is very convenient and easy to use. I wish I could use my profile to write reviews.
Version 6.1 2012-04-20 5
This is the way apps should work.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
Very useful too
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
Great
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
I use Tripadvisor every time I plan a domestic or foreign trip. The plethora of reviews gives me good, objective information about hotels and things to do virtually anyplace we go.  It's an invaluable planning tool.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 4
LuLu's Oceanside Grill. The BEST Strawberry Twist Martini EVER. Have Ginger make it. Will travel back just for that. Also my favorite wrap- ahi tuna, Fabulous !
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
Love using trip advisor and writing reviews.  Provides us with a lot of fun on our trips and we savor things more because we are more observant for writing a review.  Fun!
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
Planning my honeymoon right now and this app is making it sooo easy..
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 3
Trip Advisor is like asking for info from friends, shopkeepers and truck and cab drivers-- quality of reviews depends on the standards and experience of the reviewers. But as more people participate you can see trending
 and thus it is more reliable.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 4
Would give it 5 stars if not for some out of date info here and there. Do your homework with trip advisor before you travel.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 4
Good app. Compensates the website
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 3
Disappointed in app. Still have to go to web to do research.
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 5
The best review site ever!!!!!! This and Yelp is are my fav!
Version 6.1 2012-04-19 4
Easy to use, appreciate alerts.  Love this app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-16 1
Terrible restaurant They need a 101 course starting with service! Food, decor Do not waste your money! I find it offensive such a place is call it a restaurant
Version 6.1 2012-04-16 5
We have discovered lots of great hotels and restaurants with this app. Highly recommended. I wouldnt plan a trip without it.
Version 6.1 2012-04-16 1
Works pretty badly. Keeps on locking.
Version 6.1 2012-04-16 1
Since the last update the app does not launch at all, claiming that there is no Internet connection.
Version 6.1 2012-04-16 5
I've come to rely on TripAdvisor, whether I'm traveling or at home. Mi've never had a bad meal.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
This app is useful to get good tips and information about wherever you may be traveling.  So far the app hasn't crashed on me and so far I've found all the sites, tours, hotels, etc. in their extensive database.   I only wish it had more search functions or search reviews by date, age range of visitors, etc.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
My iPad and trip advisor ap are the perfect traveling companions.  I have been a long time fan of Trip Advisor.  The iPhone ap is a great way to access all the great features.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
Love it.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
I use this all the time as a guide for choosing hotels and restaurants when I travel. Very easy to use. A word of advice-if the review from a traveler is written like a brochure, it's probably from a friend or family member of the owner
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 1
Just upgraded my existing version. The new version is NOT good!!!  Please give me the old version back or fix. All the information that was available is gone!!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
I have found trip advisor very reliable.      Because it is written by travelers that actually have used the places and give unique reviews I really like it and use it all the time.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 3
Great tool which ease travels. It's user friendly and very convenient to make travel arrangements. I have been using every time and can say I have been able to avoid visiting travel agents
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
I love this app for finding places when I'm on the go with my family.  Very reliable and easy to use.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
Very useful, I prefer this to the website. Couple of minor quirks detract a bit, but give it a go and see if you like it - I do.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
I use it for all my travel advice. Dining, entertainment, lodging, etc...all can be found here!
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 1
I travel a lot, and this used to be my favorite app for it. The comprehensive listings of hotels, attractions, maps and reviews used to function flawlessly, and the street view option was invaluable for planning out how I would recognize my hotel once I actually arrived. 
Not any more.
Since they remained the app entirely, the results for categories are scattered, out of order and glitchily scramble based on what the map view shows, the street view function was jettisoned entirely, and the standard map view often shows the wrong location for hotels or attractions, as I've confirmed multiple times by looking them up in the desktop version of other map services.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
Only downside is the hours that disappear searching and dreaming.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
Absolutely fantastic!
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
Love the fact I can flick through submitted photos, save a favorite resort or excursion that I'm currently looking to book. 
Nicely Done!
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
Overall Tripadvisor has been my trusted advisor on the road and I travel for a living.  This app is great with its nice clean interface and easily navigable screens you will have everything you need.  would be nice to be able to interface with IPad camera but I love this app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
We always book our hotels using Trip Advisor.  The advice has never led us astray.  We know that people have many different varieties of taste, but the experiences they tell are so helpful and insightful.  Recently we have also started leaving reviews because we feel that we need to also share and help others as we have been helped.  Finally it has been interesting to note hotel websites that now also quote trip advisor's patrons.  By the way, some hotel owners have responded to concerns raised by some patrons, perhaps they are becoming aware of how widespread the advice is traveling.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if Trip Advisor gives not only gave advice to it's traveling patrons, but also to the hotels and restaurants owners to make their establishment even better.  Truly, Trip Advisor is the best advice for all!
Version 6.0 2012-04-15 2
First, I'd like to say that I'm a fan of trip advisor, I've used them to plan trips in Europe and in the US. Tonight, I was planning a trip to Vegas on my iPad for the first time. Here's the rub: when you are flipping through the attractions and select your attraction, the map zooms into the location you select (in the background?) but overlays the attraction information over the top of the map so that you can read up on it. When you go back to the list, since the map is reset, the list is reset. So, in a city like Vegas, with over 600 local attractions, you are forced to scroll through the entire list from the beginning. It's so frustrating that it seems trip advisor is forcing you to go to the website instead of using their app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
A lot of good info about different places.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 1
Seems like a good idea but the app is a real pain to work with. Trying to find restaurants near our hotel. App keeps hiding our hotel so I can se other hotels, but not ours. Giving up.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
if I leave the app (without closing it) to use another app, it forgets where I was so I have to re-enter all the data (country, state, city, forum, search for, etc).  That's really frustrating.  Otherwise, it's a really good and useful app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 1
The 'near me' knows where I am but consistently suggests things that are in bigger city 25 miles away, so hard to search and navigate, will not be using TA on iPad anymore and may not even use it at home as I am so intensely annoyed with new app, which is a huge step backward in functionality.  Horrible.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 4
I am always dubious of recommendations from random people who may not know much more than I do, but the combo of social input plus location is nice. Cannot see using it for researching locations like I would the browser version, but it is slick.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 2
The online version Is pretty good, but how does the app work?   Searched for lodging in Saba, nothing found.  Now looking for lodging in St Maarten, it shows me a world map when I select St Maarten.  Will keep trying and hope to have an epiphany of the  logic used to program this app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
I really like being able to check reviews on restaurants and hotels when we are traveling.  I also enjoy doing reviews when we eat out of stay somewhere.  Definitely a great resource and I recommend it for everyone.
Version 6.1 2012-04-15 5
This app is much better than other travel apps simply because the reviews are honest. Some travel sites are a little quick with the editing scissors--not so with Trip Advisor. That's why I respect and trust my vacations to Trip Advisor.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 4
Works better on iPad than iPhone because iPhone reading area is tiny. Also I need to retype the destination location often In the course of a search because it resets to blank search page instead of holding the last search destination.  Should provide a quicker short cut to get to the reviews.  The app does not do justice to the website but still very useful.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
Just dropped a very carefully written hotel review when I pressed "submit" after finishing - claiming the server couldn't handle it! LOTS of work down the drain. AAAARGH!

Through the tripadvisor app I've found tons of nice restaurants and things to do while traveling! So great!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Love this app. Just like the website. Only problem is it sometimes kicks me off for no reason. It doesn't happen often enough for me to be too worried.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Tripadvisor forever!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
I needed something like Google places and wow has this delivered and then some. What is there no to love? The layout is great. Easy to use. Even clicking on websites to attractions keeps you inside the trip advisor app. This is the type of app that all other apps wish they could be. Fantastic!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
I use several local user review apps for local restaurants but the true source for travel I always use Trip Advisor. I have used it for years and have found truly awesome hotels to stay at.

This is the key resource for making travel and dining decisions, around the world!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
Ummm, doesn't work.

Who upgraded this app? It is horrible. Please correct ASAP !!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 2
The regular www address is much better, much more functional.  I can't even access my own account on the app.  I wrote a review of a hotel--a long, comprehensive one--and when I submitted it, it just vanished after asking me to sign in.  I deleted this app.  I still like Trip Adviser, but not this app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Very helpful!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
I have used Trip Advisor for my last three big European vacations, including Vienna, Prague, Barcelona, Munich, Salzburg, and Venice. Two major changes have really disappointed me. First, you used to be able to arrange your entire itinerary, choose what day to see what, and print a formal itinerary with descriptions, phone numbers etc. I felt like a professional travel consultant to my friends when we travelled. Now it's gone, replaced by a save folder. Second, I hate Bing. The map serves no purpose when I have Google Maps on my phone with GPS. Please take is back to the old Trip Advisor.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Awesome app.  Easy to use! Very complete listings and reviews.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 4
Like it
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
TripAdvisor is essential in my daily life as it affords me ample opportunity with just a simple click to find nearly anything where I am traveling so I'm not shooting in dark at a hit or miss service. I wish it offered reviews for department stores and other businesses or an option to enter that business if it is not listed.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Tripadvisor at its best...
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
Oh no! the new version s soo bad. Why mess up a good thing? I have always relied heavily on you trip advisor & just love the site now We are in Sonoma & I'm stuck with the new version. It freezes the screen layout is horrible & what a waste of time fiddling around with it :(
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
I was on a trip to Florida and was told about this app. By a friend. I started using it and it has been very helpful.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 4
Nice to have a mobile option to check and leave reviews. It could be a bit more detailed and have more access to member accounts.
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 2
I've been using the web based tripadvisor for years so i imediately jumped on the ap.  After one week loking for hotels in asia I gave up. I uninstalled it and am back on the web version
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
This has to be worst "upgrade" ever in the world. Take a perfectly fine and and completely ruin it - that about describes this "upgrade". Please fire the team that did this and get us an app that actually works!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Very helpful app for anyone considering travel
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
The update/redesign has made this app sooooo much harder to use. Really miss the old view that allowed you to see prices across multiple vendors on one screen (Orbitz, Venere, etc.). Now you have to search prices one by one. Hate having a view of only 10 hotels at a time too. Please, bring back the old version!!!!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
The multiple pictures, "what's around to do," AND first-hand reviews!! LOVE IT!!!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 5
Thanks for Apple suggesting this app!  It inspires me to take more trips to places I might not have considered before,
Version 6.1 2012-04-14 1
The iPad version shows much less data then the iPhone version. They obviously need to fix some bugs.

Version 6.1 2012-04-14 4
No issue, but I wish it shows more airline consolidators who wished to see more flights choices.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
I use The Trip Advisor site or App for every lodging stay.  Never lets me down
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 3
It's ok
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 1
I find the new version for the iPhone unbearable. The switch to Bing maps which doesn't automatically fill in your current location and the destination of the chosen restaurant makes it to much of a bother to even use.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
Never leave home without it!
Version 6.0 2012-04-13 2
The app is not very helpful when browsing to find a vacation destination.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
Love this app
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 1
Lost filter with "good for". 
Lost iOS map integration.
I will leave this app unless they will be back.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
Wonderful!  Must Have!
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
Love it and I haven't left yet on our trip. It's easy, it gives every thing you you might want. My husband keeps saying during our trip planning, check trip advisor! Just can't say enough great things about it. Now on to our 3 thousand mile road trip. Will add more later. Thank you.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 1
Used to be excellent. I've written many resteraunt reviews, it was my "go to travelling place" while out of town and in town. But now since the last upgrades, my app crashes before it even opens. I tried deleting and reinstalling, and nothing. So sad, it was great before. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise, but I had to delete my app completely. ;(
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 4
Muito bom aplicativo. Recomendo.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 4
We travel with ous children and went to London and Paris and found this app very helpful. I would like more specifics in the searches for child friendly restaurants. Perhaps, one that specifies a menu?
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
Great app. Lots of good info. Easy to use.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
Excellent travail. Bravo. Merci a tous celles et ceux qui y contribuent. Merci pour le concepteur et l'initiateur.
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 5
My favorite travel app!
Version 6.1 2012-04-13 3
A generally very good app but sometimes won't load.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 5
I found the perfect weekend get-a-way place to celebrate my husband's birthday.  It was a little Shakespearean theater in Atlanta.  I would never have found it without this app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 3
The app is great. It makes travel info and user reviews accessible within few taps.  I like it better than the full web site. The only flaw is the map feature, or a lack thereof. I guess I'm spoiled by Yelp! which has a tight in-app map integration.  TA's map feature does work, but mobile apps are not about whether they work, but about convenience and accessibility they bring in spite of limited user interface capability available.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 5
I was skeptical of TA at first. The more i study it and use it, the more value i see in it.  Excellent. There is a glitch in the filter sort field in the iPhone version however. The "tours" and "attractions" fields do not separate properly.  Otherwise it's a handy tool for mobile ranking info.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 5
Very helpfull when traveling.  Has almost everything you'll need!
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 4
Very handy app for planning a trip. So far the only thing I don't like is the "back" button. If you have been reading reviews it will go back to each review instead of the previous menu. When I am done reading reviews I want to go back to the search menu and I have to tap back a dozen times to get there.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 2
Very disappointed in the map feature with Bing. We picked some good restaurants using "near me now", but when I tried to locate using the map feature there is no marker to help me find it.  This bug significantly reduces the mobile friendliness of TA. PLEASE FIX!
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 2
Your app does not work well.  Maps are a disaster.  You can spend a lot of time just trying to get a decent view.  It starts at the satellite level for Berlin.  Dumb.  Who needs to see a map of all Europe when looking for hotels in Berlin.  It favors hotels that I don't want see and blocks my view of other hotels.  You have gone too commercial now and present hotels that pay you more.  This is not how Trip Advisor started and developed it's following.  You are opening the door for someone else to take over and not be biased. 

Unlike the website there is no place to put in your dates.  Thus you waste a lot of time and then find out it is not available.  I have tried other cities and the same problems.   It keeps crashing also and you have to start all over.  It is getting so it is easier to just use Hotels.com or Expedia.com or one of the others.  They are much quicker.  You end up there anyway.  The developer  of the App needs to do a lot of upgrading.  Very, very frustrating. Bob
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 2
I do not like this forced upgrade app.
The old app worked wayyy better.
Example, I am trying to find a hotel near the SFO airport and it gives me either that does not exist or some where in Italy. 
There is no  way to sign into my account to give a review of a property or restaurant.
You would think the iPad version wold be a step up and not backwards. 
Hopefully the next revision will bring back the old functionality or I'll have to just go back to using the website on my laptop.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 4
Photos really help to get the try feel of a place.  Thanks travelers for posting them on trip advisor
Version 6.0 2012-04-09 5
Great app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 5
Trip advisor is my "go to" when I'm in a new location.
Version 6.1 2012-04-09 5
just what is needed to enjoy vacation time!
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
Who loves to travel should have this app in your iPhone. It does exactly what you expect from a trip advisor. It is amazing.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 4
Love me some tripadvisor!
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 2
A search for restaurants in Las Vegas yields about 1,000, however the app only allows you to see reviews on a couple dozen. This renders the app nearly useless.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
Trip advisor is very accurate.  It helped my husband and out when we planned our trip to Maui.  Very informative.
Thank you... DJ
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 3
I really liked the previous version, but the current version seems to have some quirks and bugs. Example: looking for 'Bonaire' I get suggested results 'Bonaire, Caribbean', 4000mile east, and 'kralendijk, Bonaire', 1400 mile SE.  Both are the same place, so something is wrong about the coordinates. Second example, I look at the entire Bonaire map, and it only shows 4 hotels. But: it states 'number 7 out of 23 hotels'.  OK, great, so why can't I see the other 19? At which point you notice that the 'settings' icons does not have an option to provide feedback. 

And finally, about the clunkiness, they should separate 'back to previous section' from 'back to previous view'. I had panned around the map for a while, and tried to go back to the main menu using the 'back' button. Turns out, you new to rewind through your entire map history to get back to the menu. Odd. Also, the 'back' button not iOS standard. Why not follow UI guidelines.

Update, from what I read the current state of affairs is due to the switch to Bing. So maybe it's this: if bing can't map the address of the hotel, it won't show in the app. Makes sense, except that it makes the app useless in certain places..
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 4
I've been using this app for a while. Love the content but there's some bugs that need to be addressed after this last update. I much preferred previous version.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 4
Works well so far
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
This app is totes magotes fab!!! This app is perfffff :) lmmfao!!! I go to a different state every weekend! So I love this app! It's fabulous!!!!!! :)))) I've got a lot of $$$!!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
I am getting used to TripAdvisor. It works great in Europe.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
You can't beat it for finding up-to-date reviews on hotels, restaurants, pubs, towns in general, etc.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
I just downloaded this app today, and am finding it very user-friendly!  I haven't had any problems with the links, and I love how you can connect immediately to different sites like expedia and orbitz for price information.  Thank you for such a convenient app!
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
Love to review and rate while I  on the road
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
Quite good!
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
We use it everywhere we go.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 4
Very useful app to use when traveling and planning out the days events. The only improvement would be to include the meal prices for restaurants like the webpage does.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 4
Great tool. Easy to use. Love map feature and reviews.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
I am traveling through Asia and am loving this app. Every where I go I can look up the best places to visit and stay right at my finger tips. Love!
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 3
Still some work left to do, but I like every update.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
Easier than the website
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 2
I absolutely loved the version before this latest, and would have given it 5 stars. But this new layout is awkward and annoying to maneuver. I hate the filters menu on the right, it covers 3/4 of the map! And you can hide it...but why not set the default to it being hidden and if we want it, then we click on it?! I look for a hotel based on the map, so that's what I want to see. It's just a poor layout compared to the last version and there are more steps just to get to the price of the hotel...and back to the list. And i dislike that the list is always up on the left side, liked it better when I could view info and prices of a hotel across the whole screen. Please change back!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
The best app for people they are traveling all over the world
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
We've used TripAdvisor online for years: couldn't plan a trip without it. The iPad app is fantastic while we're on the trip, making finding nearby restaurants a snap. Great mixture of maps, reviews, photos right in the moment when we're hungry and making a dining decision. The only drawback at the moment is that not all restaurants nearby show up on the local search. We saw an attractive restaurant while we were walking around our vacation rental neighborhood, and didn't find it later in the app. I guess we'll need to eat there and then write the first review. The app is a great resource.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
Expected.  Helps a lot when trying to please in-laws.
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 5
An app you need every time you travel
Version 6.1 2012-04-08 3
I really love this app and gave it a five star. But I have come back to downgrade after the last update that removed the portrait mode. The portrait allowed for easy sharing of information with friends such as itinerary info. Now it is gone. I have been planning a trip to Africa with a friend. When I expand itinerary details I can't even see half of it. So when i print the screen to email, i send incomplete info. I do not really understand why the portrait mode has been removed.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Works as it should
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 3
Easy to use on the go. Quick to find reviews of nearby restaurants, etc. iPad app looks slick but is somewhat annoying due to "home" just putting you out to screen where you have to choose restaurants/hotels/etc. Hard to enter a review from home screen for example. 

But overall is fine and does the job for a mobile app.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 4
Great app, just wished the my saves worked from the app to the website.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Thanks
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
I use this all of the time. The ratings are generally accurate and always informative. Many know of Trip Advisor so I'll just rate the app. Easy to use, informative, and everything I would expect.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 1
Poorly designed application that does not leverage the iOS standard look. Regularly errors. No crashes yet.

In other words find something else.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 2
I love tripadvisor.com, but find this app to be really lacking. You are better off browsing to the web site. Disappointing.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Very help full!
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 1
Loved the app.  Updated - now will not work at all. Deleted and reinstalled twice. Still will not work.  Flashes front page and disappears.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Trip advisor made our "trip" amazing! Without it we wld have been lost!
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 4
Just downloaded the app after looking at recommendations on the website. Easy to use and apparently fair assessments of the restaurants I have looked at. Like the ranking, makes it easier to get consensus on where to go. Eg only a top 50 place, for example.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Excelente muy buenooo
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Works very well and the information has been accurate and valuable. I use it all the time.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 1
No portrait mode,
Search for a city brings up a particular area of the map only. Back to using the web version.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 2
Content from users is what made me get this app. Very useful for trips. What is annoying is that after reading several reviews on the tripadvisor app, it kicks you back to the beginning of your initial search; so you have to input your information from scratch again & again & again...HIGHLY AGGRAVATING!!!!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
I have not been mis-lead by any of the info available on this site. Although the site does default to your current location, starting your search with the city or zip code of your destination immediately gets you there.  I recommend this site to my traveling colleagues all the time.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Love it
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Use it every time I travel
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 1
Loved this app...would have been 5 stars, until I upgraded a few days ago and now....nothing.  Won't open.  Awesome. I had been loving checking out reviews and pictures of our upcoming honeymoon destination.  Wish I hadn't upgraded.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Muy buena herramienta, sobre todo si eres turista ayuda bastante.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 1
Won't let you log into any account.  Will not sync with any other device or load your saves.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 5
Never got bad info from this site. Always helpful.
Version 6.1 2012-04-07 1
This used to be a great app then, in the latest update, they replaced Google Maps with Bing Maps, which don't work most of the time. This app is useless to me if it can't show me the location on a map.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Every city I visit I check out on Tripadvisor. Have found so many great local restaurants and activities by checking here first.  Thanks for the info!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Great app.  I Always  use it before booking a hotel.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 2
Each version this gets less user friendly. It's easier to skip and just go to the regular website.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
I've used this app for all of my planning. It has great guest reviews and pictures. Easy to use and navigate through. All the information you need in on place.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 1
This used to be a good app, and still is in many ways. However, when traveling it seems to detect that you're moving and automatically goes into the "what's around you" mode.  Guess their programmers never considered that I might want to be looking at what's available at my destination, which is currently about two hours away...  Thanks guys!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
It was perfect before i installed the latest update..now it's hard to use and i can't find my location on trip advisor, also i cant find all the things to do that are on the website..
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 4
Easy to find good recommendation
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Great app was VERY Useful
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Gives the most detailed info about any given hotel! I've been planning a trip to California & these other websites never really give much info. You can see photos from other users who have stayed at a particular hotel & there are far more reviews! I like the impartiality of the app. The reviews are uncut & so are the photos! I highly recommend this awesome app!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
This app made my trip to Thailand much easier....and helped me save some $ also. Thanks!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Planned a spur of the moment weekend in the car and kept using it all weekend to plan meals and stuff to do.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Easy to use and very intuitive highly recommend.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
Using for a trip to China, San Francisco, paso Robles and Argentina. Best source for reliable current info.
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 5
I mostly use this app to find top things to do, so far, I found it very informative and I'm just grateful!
Version 6.1 2012-04-06 2
I like the old ones!!!!  That was more useful and the design was better than the new vision! I think 
The color green is the VI ! Don't like red and gray which sign the place out!
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 3
I use Trip Advisor a fair bit, for the reviews and forums, so I got the app. I find it not as easy to navigate as the website. The choices for searches are limited. Stick to the web.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 5
Great site
Version 6.0 2012-04-02 5
A total "go to app. Use it! You won't be disappointed.:)
Version 6.0 2012-04-02 5

Enjoy the convenience of Tripadvisor on your mobile device. Easy to use and helpful.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 5
I use it whenever I travel. Always.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 5
Helpful. Our go-to app for planning
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 2
I like some of the changes, but really frustrated with the map.  If I am searching hotels in a city, don't show me a map of the entire US that I then have to zoom in on!  Fix this!!!
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 4
Muy util para Los viajeros ciudadanos del mundo.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 1
Horrible since the update. They got rid of the best feature map view.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 4
Handy to have will traveling.
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 4
good app
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 5
Love this app....always check it before and during travel. I always find great places that I'd never know about otherwise!
Version 6.1 2012-04-02 1
Was a great app, but no more!  Sometimes it shows only one hotel and a few things to do for major cities.  Had to look very hard to find hotels that I found on desktop version.  Go back to old version!
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 5
Very useful in planning vacation.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 5
Good App
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 4
We use this app every time we go on vacation to check for the best hotels and nearby restaurants. Love it.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
This upgrade is terrible and makes the app 95% useless. Google Maps cover small towns in Vietnam, Peru and Rwanda. Bing doesn't even cover Shanghai. They might as well have scrapped maps altogether because now the pins are just scattered around a useless blob instead of pointing to, you know, STREETS. They switched the full Tripadvisor site to Bing maps too... Stupid move Tripadvisor, very stupid move. I'll just use Kayak to book my hotels now instead since their maps actually show the hotel's location (what a concept!)
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 5
Excellent food, great prices, awesome service!
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 4
Great for dining recommendations in specific areas of town.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
The new TA upgrade is horrible. I have been a member of TA since 2004. I have been trying to use the new app all day and I cant run searches of city's I want to visit. This app must be fixed!
Version 6.0 2012-04-01 2
I used to love this app, but the update/grade really made it more cumbersome to use.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
This WAS a great app, but the update has rendered it ridiculous. Fix it.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
The update was a step back. It doesn't display all the hotels or restaurants, it limits you to a map cogerage area, it loads slowly. The older one was simple and easy to use.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
This new version is awful. Can only view in landscape. Before I had to update I could see 23 restaurants for my current location. After the update it only listed two. Please fix or bring back the old version!
Version 6.0 2012-04-01 4
It's one of my dependable apps.  Solid reference, good interface.  Maps can be a bit quirky on iPhone and iPad at times.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 4
I can not post my review!! keep showing that i need to update area marks in red. not working. crap
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 2
Three things to fix before this app is worth the trouble of using it:
1. Search engine doesn't find even some of the most popular venues.
2. Map constantly moves if you look at an item within it, necessitating relocating the previous view.
3. Pictures in pictures tab don't load.
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 1
I'm in the middle of searching for a restaurant and you force me to upgrade to your new app? Now it won't find my location?
You guys are messing with a good app trying to make it better and made it worse.
I'm switching to open table!
Bye!
Version 6.1 2012-04-01 4
Useful app to find things in an area.  I like the map tool a lot because you can move around an area to see what is there and get a feel for it before you get there.  Only beef is that the save feature doesn't always let you expand your area easily from the specific town you're in - it hesitates for a while before figuring out that you want to include saves from a larger area into the view.
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 3
Not loving it...miss the ability to view all locations within a city, not as grouped on the map.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
I've been planning a late May/early June trip to Hawaii and have spent countless hours online researching best deals, info about hotels, etc.  I've finally booked this afternoon thru Expedia, but couldn't have done it without the fantastic information available on TripAdvisor!!  From hotel rankings to "what to do" activities to the forum (a GREAT resource!), TripAdvisor has it all!!  I won't travel again without checking TA.  :-)  P.S.  Expedia continues to amaze me with their deals and their customer service is top notch.  In my opinion, the travel insurance they offer is the best out there.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
The new upgrade won't even open....what the hell? Thanks TA for ruining a good app
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 2
App was excellent. Now fair! Should have left things be.. Old app easy to use and showed complete results. This one hard to use and limits things to map area rather than city. Still can't figure. How to get b&b's under hotels. A miss.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
This really stinks. The new version doesn't work properly on the iPad.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
This app is so awesome! It's a one stop shop for everything you need to know prior to visiting a city. I freaking LOVE IT!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
Great info... Eats, accommodation, + activities...
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
Crash on start up on IOS 3 after installing 6.1.
Reinstalled 6.0, it still start but insisted on upgrade, rendering 6.0 useless also.
How draconian is that???
ZERO star, or should we go negative stars???
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
As an owner of a restaurant and a hotel in a popular tourist destination in Costa Rica, we check TA every day.  The new forced upgrade for the iPad doesn't show all the venues.  For example, in a current search by popularity (previously rating) 1/2 or more of the hotels don't show up.  For the restaurants, search close to me or  y location ZERO restaurants showed up.  

Trip advisor is a valuable resource, how they could allow a developer to roll out a non functional update is beyond me.  I don't know if it is possible but I would suggest a rollback until the ap is ready and tested.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
This is a great way to find out about places before you go there.  I've stayed at a couple places just going by the hotel's description, which is rarely like they sat.  I like to hear about it from people who have actually stayed there.  Trip Advisor is great!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
Your last upgrade really did wonders for the usability of the app. The interface is much improved and I like the Bing map better than the Google map. Please keep improving this app. My wife and I own an RV and we intend to use this app to the fullest when we embark on our 2012 camping trips.
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 5
Don't leave home without it! Using 3G network in the car found a great restaurant in Maine I never would have found any other way. Met a friend there for dinner and was a star for finding it!

Works well.  No complaints.

I use tripadvisor for every hotel and restaurant before I go. Sometimes inn keepers fiberwibber about their places, but look in the reviews and you will find the truth.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
Latest update for iPad is Poor, and dies not wok.  Return date on flights will not work.....

This is NOT an improvement.  Please provide previous app and trash this update......

How can I get the older version reloaded on my iPad.....
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 4
This app is very close to the full version website that I prefer to use on my laptop. I use the the iPhone version when I am on the go and need some quick advice on a restaurant. Very fast and helpful.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
Used to use this app often. Great app. Updated and now crashes. Useless.
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 5
Very helpful app when traveling and love that people provide their personal feedback as well as being able to see feedback from my Facebook friends! Just great!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 4
Love using this when needing to look up stuff for a trip. It has great suggestions and even lists the prices! The only downside is that it requires Internet constantly, which isn't the app's fault. But it makes it harder for me on the go when I don't got wifi on my iPad. The new design is awesome. Yes it's only landscape view, but that allows the user to fully enjoy the various features Tripadvisor.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
I much prefer when TripAdvisor allowed Portrait view of the screen to the landscape screen  I now prefer to use Google to access the site rather than the app. Please fix it.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
Use this for every trip and for most local outing, too. Love it, but wish my saves were available across the desktop, mobile, and iPad versions.  Thanks to all the folks giving advice and feedback on the site.
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 4
Love the App.  My only complaint is that material accessible is not as updated as website.  I checked "Things to do" in Incline Village , Nevada and just got a bunch of golf courses.  The website has far more.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 5
Like the interface
Version 6.0 2012-03-31 3
It's okay, but inconsistent.  Sometimes it works well and other times, not so much.  I don't like that you have to view landscape and it is difficult/ finicky when you actually try to book a hotel...  Improvements needed!!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 2
Stupid , I use to love it and could write a review now they confuse the $&@?, out of u

Very satisfied with this app. Use it all the time. I even recommend it to anyone planning a vacay.
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 1
This new version is terrible. Bing maps is worst Google. Don't have street view. The configuration window have zero options, I can't configure language. I want the previus version.

A great app to see what people think about local attractions, fare, and lodging.  A must have in my opinion.  Check it out!
Version 6.1 2012-03-31 4
Only downside is not being able to have access to your profile.

It can't find many attractions on the map.  It reports hundreds of hotels, etc. on St.. Maarten/St. Marten and only shows/finds 20 or so of them.
Version 6.0 2012-03-30 5
This app is great for people that travel or if you want to find the best of anything near you or anywhere for that matter.  I use it all the time when I travel to find hotels, recreation, food, shopping.  It is a must have app.  I think there is nothing more telling, good or bad to a place than the reviews from ordinary people who have been customers.  Not only helps you, but helps others too and I have gotten an immediate response from the places that I have given poor review to.  These businesses read our reviews and they mean  a lot of business to them.  Join the calvary and help set things straight.

The app has a great combination of all the tools you need for great planning. Insights, maps, hotel/restaurant/store access, street view and, of course, reviews from real people.  I don't care for the new interface as much ...but the content is everything you need for planning a trip.

Forcing users into landscape mode?  One word: Why?
Version 6.0 2012-03-29 4
It would be even greater and save me much time if I cod free on amenities. I'm looking for hotels with pools only. I don't see that I can do that here.
Version 5.93 2012-03-28 5
I went on my first big backpacking trip a few weeks back and used trip advisor many times during my vacation either for hotels, activities/ events near where I was and massages!!! I found that with trip advisor I could refine the search to be exactly what I was looking for, and everyone's comments helped me out a lot. Since then I have use trip advisor to log my travels and help others out in the same way they helped me! 

Now I will use tripadvisor for everything travel related!!

I travel most weeks for my job. I almost never take the time to research each area before I hop on that week's flight.  But I don't want to miss exploring the best of each town/city while I'm there. This app is perfect for quickly finding the best local spots. You never have to eat at the hotel or spend the evening watching tv. Thanks to tons of reviews you can find where to go in a flash. I'm never disappointed. You can also find wifi spots through a search which is handy.  I rely on it daily.
Version 6.0 2012-03-28 4
Slow, but good interface. Would love to have the top 20 destination list in app too

TripAdvisor made our trip to Italy - Florence, Sorrento, Rome. Outstanding choices for restaurants, things to do.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 1
I hate it when apps are improved so that they are less functional than before. In the old version, you could move the map and search again for hotels in the displayed map. No can do in this version as hotels with dozens of reviews will not display on the map or show up even in the details. I'm using iPad 1, and latest IOS. I will have to go back to the web from now on. Bummer.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
Great resource for overseas trips. Nice to be able to see recent reviews for local places right when you need to decide where to eat. Better than a concierge.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
What can I say, this app is awesome! My family and I used it doing our trip to Vegas and it showed us other places to go besides the strip. We enjoyed ourselves thanks to this app!!!!

The First stop that any beer enthusiast should make while visiting Santa Rosa has got to be the Russian River brewery on Fourth street. Many flavors for every pallet, hard to make a bad choice here. Try the sampler and find your favorite. Pliny the Elder wins my vote, at 8% this double IPA does the trick... Enjoi :)

Don't leave home without a review! Travel advisor is usually spot on. Travel for my job into different cities around the country weekly. I come here first. The reviews are very helpful and usually spot on. I have found great places to eat I might have never tried if I hadn't read it here first and I depend on the up to date hotel reviews to pick what's best for me and my needs.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
Great app, thx
Use it when I travel, really helps
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 1
Why oh why did you "improve" this app so that it only works in landscape mode? I hate this new version, it runs slower and I really don't like having to use it "sideways". Please fix.

Planning trip to Turks & Caicos. Started using tripadvisor.com but the site suggested I download the app. Already had app so fired that up to continue the search I was doing for scuba shops on Provo. Oddly the app only reports 1 thing to do. There are over 50 attractions at that location per the website, and another 30 or so tours. I hadn't set any filters (clearing didn't help). Anyway it's a mess and I'm back to using the site, which actually works great. Hopefully they'll address the issues but I don't recommend bothering.
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
I use it all the time when planning my trips. Actually like the app better than the website. Nice job TA!
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
I love trip advisor. I'm a traveling nurse and this is my little travel secret, it's the best app out there for US travel (can't comment on international as I haven't used it for that). The app itself is pretty good. It's easy to navigate and I haven't had any crashes. My only complaint is that I can't use it in portrait mode. I'm not sure why that is, but it annoys the heck out of me!
Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
I found Tripadvisor in 2010 after using several different booking sites to compare hotels. I wished I had found it earlier because it made planning our last two hotels in Europe much easier. I found the reviews to be very insightful and correct, and it's easier for me to trust an independent site. I've nearly only used Tripadvisor to plan our 2012 trip to Europe and am looking forward to sharing our experiences for the benefit of future fellow travelers!

Version 6.0 2012-03-27 5
First used trip advisor many years ago.  Pretty straight up with good reviews, good monitoring, and many excellent contributors. As you might suspect, the reviews written by us are what people look for.  Now that I have this iPad, well things are even easier to both enter and review. Most of us travel some and go out to eat, movies, attractions, all that stuff. Taking the time to write a quick review might make the difference between someone else having an okay time (or worse) and an excellent time.

It looks terrible on my iPhone. Look at AirBnb to how it should be done.
Version 6.0 2012-03-24 1
The app is merely a wrapper for their web site.   Not only it does not behave like a native app, which could be ignored, if t was not for every operation as simple as sorting requiring a trip to the server.   Navigating here is just impossible, specially when you are on the road with poor connectivity.

In some cases, tapping in features does nothing, hard to tell what failed.   Tapping on things repeatedly is the only solution.    

No way to login globally across invocations either.

The service is still great, just use a desktop to access

How does an average restaurant or hotel with 3.5 or 4 stars and a couple dozen ratings get a higher ranking than a place that consistently ranks 4.5 stars with more ratings get a lower rating? There's something dubious about TA's ranking system. It seems especially egregious in places that I know well. Like Sedona, Az; Williams, Az; and, Flagstaff, Az.

Also, there are too many defunct restaurants listed. TA needs a better way to clean-up their venues that are history.

Version 6.0 2012-03-18 4
this app is very good and benefits from the huge number of existing reviews. however, some details are missing which would make it even better. for example, when searching for a restaurant, can sort based on popularity or distance. what about a hybrid? for example, I want to see the most popular restaurants in a 10 mile radius, not the most popular restaurants in the city of Sao Paulo which could be 3 hrs away.
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 1
I took an update on all apps including trip advisor yesterday.  Now I can just get it so it is
sideways on iPad and the flights is no longer available. 
Since we are in Mexico and planning to return home at end of March, this is a REAL big
inconvenience.   We booked for flight down (one way for flexibility) and now it shows me
all sorts of exotic places, not where we want to go.   Help !    please change it back to
how it was.   It was way more friendly prior to update. 

(who in hell does these 'updates' anyway?   what kind of mentality do they have???)
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 4
Always good info when taking a trip. Hasn't failed me yet.
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 5
It has it all convenience, easy, great access and everything you need to plan a trip
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 5
Best reviews on the web
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 3
This was one of my first apps and I've always used it for travel & research. I'd be at a loss without it. In my opinion, the user-interface is better than the website. But it seems to be having growing pains. After I installed the new OS it would often freeze. It just had an update & is working much better & offers new features but it seems to be missing original ones. Where is the button for other hotels & how can you see the whole hotel list? Please stop changing.
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 5
How did I live so long without it
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 5

This is a very solid app that I have used extensively to plan trips
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 5
Great app for finding food.
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 1
Too far from the main stream to be worth the trip!
We had: fried cod fish - too greasy; salmorejo=too much garlic; stuffed eggplant was ok but nothing to write home about and the service could be better!
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 1
You made a mess with the recent update get it back to the way it was
Version 6.0 2012-03-18 4
I use it all the time on my iPhone and iPad and love it.
It's easy, quick and helpful when traveling to new areas.
My only wish is that the app could also link to you Trip Advisor home page and maps/profile.
Version 5.93 2012-03-18 4

No need to carry your laptop to access info from tripadvisor - app is easy to use and the gps locator makes finding nearby restaurants and attractions quick.
Version 5.93 2012-03-12 4
Used this on different trips now and it's very helpful for finding places to go and to avoid.   Watch the dates on the reviews;  sometimes the quality changes with management. You can look at bad reviews but they're all 3 years old and more recent reviews are more positive. Seem it go both ways with this. Great ver helpful app.

Version 5.93 2012-03-10 1
First time user - too many restaurants CLOSED! Needs to be updated more often!
Version 5.93 2012-03-10 3
After reviewing and selecting a site to book through, I entered all my contact and payment information. User-friendly and normal.
I elected to review the policy since I chose a site I had never used before; after reading the policy my only options were 'Menu' and 'Return to TripAdvisor'. Menu was clearly not the correct choice, so I selected 'Return to TripAdvisor'. Instead of being returned to page where I had already entered all my information, I was returned to the very first screen of selecting my hotel stay dates. I had to completely start my search over again! It felt like I was being punished for wanting to stay informed and review the fine print.
If you are detail-oriented, use a different site to book your trip.
Version 5.93 2012-03-10 5
Use TripAdvisor for a few years and it is the best tool on the net and in advertising. The customer is the only person who really knows what is great service or poor quality. Thank you TripAdvisor for a great tool.

Trip advisor has done a really great job with this app. It's better than their actual site so I often find myself doing trip planning on my phone rather than the computer. Images look great and searching through hotels and local attractions is pretty simple. Kudos!
Version 5.93 2012-03-04 5
My husband, friend, and I enjoyed a wonderful, informative walking tour led by Franco. The tour lasted four hours, with many breaks along the way...in fact the tour was ended before we realized the time! I highly recommend this tour. Franco did such a great job; he leads tours at 10:00 am, except Thursday when he does the afternoon one. Great experience!

It would be awesome if it could offer some more info about places such as hours of operation. Otherwise a pretty good app.
Version 5.92 2012-02-23 5
This is a fantastic app for on-the-go searches. I was using Yelp to find hotels, then going online to search for substantive reviews of each one but it was tedious and, honestly, I didn't want to pick based on single reviews or the completely untrustworthy ratings on hotels.com (that's a whole 'nother review). But the tripadvisor app gave me hotels in order of rank by reviews, and the reviews were legit! (Not just a bunch of 5-star reviews from 'a traveler'  with no comments to back it up. I'm looking at you, hotels.com.)

Plus, once we picked our hotel I could just click the next tab to find a great place to eat. Love this very useful, quick and practical app!
Version 5.92 2012-02-23 5

I always use TripAdvisor when traveling. There are some bugs that need to be worked out when using the map. I don't like how it doesn't show you where something is on a map, just the information about the restaurant/activity/hotel.

Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
I absolutely love this app.  If you like to travel like I do this app is all you need to plan your vacations.  With just a touch of a button you have access to all the attractions, hotels, and restaurants in your area.  With photos, and reviews it helps you to find all the hotspots you are looking for. I would be loss without this app.  So many times I've gone on vacation and googled things to do, and never had a large selection like I do now.
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
Very convenient. I use it all the time!

My wife and I like to find local eateries and places off the tourists trail when we travel.  TripAdvisor recommendations and reviews have been invaluable.
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
Found lots of great cheap restaurants when I was planning a trip to a friend's house I highly recommend it!
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 4
I always check trip advisor before I make a booking, it's not just the reviews, but the responses that also contribute equally to my decision, it's great to have a tool like this! Cheers to more informed travel & stay!

We travel a lot, and my first choice to figure out what to do in the towns that we visit would be trip advisor. It rates the number one location to the 20th location and so on. I love this app...
Version 5.9 2012-02-18 5
This app is very fast, easy to use and full of great info. I use tripadvisor for every trip I take, whether personal or business travel. Laughing at the people who say they would never pay for this app again. Duh....it's free!
Version 5.92 2012-02-18 5
I'm So much more prepared for the type of visit I'll experience because of the resources this app offers.  Easy to navigate!  A must have app for anyone who travels.

You just have to remember that one man's junk is another man's treasure.  The recent reviews are more valuable than old ones.  Star ratings are not everything.  Look for consistent compliments or complaints among several reviews.
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 1
Gave me wrong direction and map. Imagine get lost 2-3 mild from where u wanna be at night with no car and yr phone about to run out of juice in a chilly night. They also took my review off the first time I commented.
Version 5.92 2012-02-13 5
Have now been in Panama City for 3 days and have used the reviews constantly. Have yet to be disappointed, but have discounted 1 or 2 Bad reviews when there are several good to excellent one. Have had my first review posted and will continue to post reviews as we go places, do things and eat out.

Unlike many other snobby websites, tripadvisor has input from middle class travelers like you and me who can tell you in plain english what they like or don't like about a hotel. I love the reliability of its reviews and being able to order them to see the most recent or by ge group. A hotel could be great for the grannies, burnout the hipsters, or vice versa!

Get this APP.

Version 5.92 2012-02-02 5
I will not go anywhere unfamiliar without checking with trip advisor. People's reviews give the perfect referrals, much better to have someones opinion then going to a place blind. Even the best hotels have bad reviews, so it's nice to shop around.  It's also great for searching out new restaurants, site seeing and vacation get-always. I have to thank Andy for sharing this site with me!

My trip to Tahiti would have been a total miss without the reviews on Trip Advisor. It was completely invaluable in choosing where to eat, what to do, and where to stay.

So far so good. I've been pleased on what I'm finding for upcoming trip to China.

Solid flavorings, nice presentation, but mahi mahi over cooked and dry, same for the red snapper.  There are better restaurants in Grand Case - L'Auberge Gourmande for one.

I always think that word-of-mouth reputation is the best kind. This app is awesome for that, and has helped find places to eat and stay when traveling.
Version 5.91 2012-01-23 5
I just got back from a trip to Austria and Germany and found trip advisor to be far more up to date and to offer a broader set of recommendations for hotels and restaurants.  Every recommendation was right on point.
Version 5.92 2012-01-23 5
Good stuff and helpful in unfamiliar city.
Version 5.92 2012-01-23 5
Tripadvisor gets the app right.  Speedy and concise.  Better user experience than the web site!

This is a great app and I really like the quick glance at the 1-5 radio type buttons for ratings. However, Yelp also has a great App and I am split on which one I prefer but find myself using Yelp more often.
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 5
Really great app no issues works like a charm

Spectacular & functional!!
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 5
I love this app, I have only been using for a short time but it has already prevented me from making a couple bad decisions. We recently booked a cruise and are looking for a place to stay the day before we depart and a couple of days after we come back. A lot of the hotels around the Miami area look nice on their web site but after I read some of the reviews from people who stayed in these places, it made me think twice. I don't want to spend a lot of money on a hotel, but I also don't want to rune what I hope to be a great vacation with a miserable last couple of days because we stay at a bad hotel. I believe this App is going to help me avoid this mistake.
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 5
Helped out tremendously
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 4
The one thing that would make it better is if you could sign into Facebook with the app. I already have information saved within the Facebook version of this app. It would be great to integrate that information within this app as well.
Version 5.9 2012-01-22 5
Real people relaying their experience is the best advice you can get.
Version 5.92 2012-01-22 4

My husband and I booked a four hour tour with Gavin from Milestone Tours Auckland New Zealand following a 13 hour flight. We had a full morning seeing so many wonderful sites around Auckland.  Gavin is very friendly and personable and extremely knowledgeable. We almost forgot  how tired we were!   He was very attentive  to the group and seemed to really enjoy his job. Thank for your great tour Gavin.

I would never consider traveling without first consulting Trip Advisor!
Version 5.91 2012-01-21 4
So far, I've used tripadvisor, as well as almost every other travel site out there and non have been as useful, accurate, and easy to use as the tripadvisor. I'm impressed.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
I am a huge fan of trip advisor. I have been pleased with the advice - although you should toss out the outrageously good and bad.  I have been using the new iPad app today & have found it to be very robust. The pictures on the iPad are quite good.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 4
This app works great on my iPad. Having no problems with it so far.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
Awesome
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
Companies take notice to the reviews made on trip advisor. I'm certain they have improved many of the problems that trip advisor reviewers have voiced complaints about. I also take the time to review the businesses I patron with good juju just to keep the yin and yang thing happy and balanced. Thank you Trip Advisor!

Enough said.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 4
For lodging and food, tripadvisor's up to the minute reviews give you confidence traveling anywhere. iPhone interface makes finding good places when you're hungry easy.

One problem with the interface is it requires Internet connectivity to use, even to access saved items. That needs to change.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
Planning a fun anniversary date with me wife for #12. This app is fun and gives me everything I need to blow her away.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 4
This app would be excellent if I didn't require anything specific in my search.  As it is, I must look for rooms w/wheelchair access and roll-in showers.  Unfortunately I have to go outside this app to get that info.  But for a quick look at what people think it's great.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5

Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5

Great free application.  It really helps when I am traveling.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
Trip Advisor is always helpful when doing research for hotels, cities, resorts and other attractions. We have used it to travel throughout New England, New Zealand, DC, Philly, and California. We also use it to find day/weekend activities for our toddlers.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 5
I use it often.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 3
Seems ok if you're scouting for eats in a strange place. But I can't figure out how to search for a restaurant by name.
Version 5.92 2012-01-21 1
I just installed the app and it already annoys the crap out of me ... Arg
I don't get any search results that I ask for and if I want to change my search the app refuses me to do so.
Sure hope this is fixable ... I already reinstalled it twice ... No change :-(

Version 5.92 2012-01-19 5
I totally depend on this app when ever I travel or search for a restaurant anywhere. It's extremely dependable as the reviews are from real people like me. One thing is that you have to read many reviews before making a decision as everyone has different likes and dislikes. Important to remember.   

I especially like the fact that reviews are detailed and not generic. People give details about the food, service, actual room numbers, travel to and from etc. 

All in all, LOVE IT.

I travel extensively to unfamiliar areas for work. This app makes finding simple things like restaurants easy, and I love the reviews to know which to steer clear from.

Most of the website functionality and appears to run well on limited bandwidth.

I don't know what I would do without this app while traveling. Extremely helpful!
Version 5.9 2012-01-10 5
So far this is the best I've found. Its like the yelp of traveling apps. Great for young travelers on a budget too. Easy to use and very useful with "near me" search functions. Thanks for making it!
Version 5.9 2012-01-10 5
Loving it. I've wandered about in BA now for a couple days, this app makes it easier to find more info quickly. I don't have to guess about a restaurant, or something fun to do. Also very helpful that BA is wifi friendly everywhere

Very few hotels came up on my search in Winter Park, Co. The ones that came up appeared to have pictures taken by random patrons as if it was their FB site. I'm deleting this as soon as I finish this sentence!

Version 5.9 2012-01-07 5
I rely on tripadvisor during all of my travels.  While the web site is great, the iPad app is a totally different level.  I love zooming the map, searching within an area, and the integrated street level views.  Wow...now I know exactly the look of the neighborhood and the entire experience.  Totally great!

Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
Whenever I plan a trip for my family after deciding on our destination, the next thing we do is have our annual consultation with trip advisor. Now that the app is available for my iPad it's even easier to stay updated while on the go. The other social media out there cannot compare.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 4
I use almost weekly. Always good to have real reviews from people like me. I've only been misinformed once due to the restaurant moving recently. So call ahead.
Version 5.9 2011-12-30 5
This is a must have download. I got this app for my 4s and really like the ease of use and effective searches that this simple offers.

When I don't know where to go to eat, this app helps me find good restaurant around me and the reviews help a lot when making final decision!

Wow, what an app.  We were staying at a hotel in Santa Monica and it shows where we are and where restaurant we wanted to go was.  So useful.  Thank you!

Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
I used for our St Augustine trip and was very helpful!
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 4
This is a great app with lots of information about almost anywhere that one could take a trip to. The information gets constantly updated by people like yourself. Instead of just seeing professional photographs of a hotel, restaurant etcetera you have every day people's photos which tell a true story not just the ones that the establishment wants for your to see. You can't do everything on the app as you can on the computer but there is enough info to help make decisions.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
I've used Trip Advisor for years and it has made our vacations so much better.  The hotel ratings are awesome, but my favorite feature is "attractions" - it helps to find out which attractions are best and worth the money!  Thanks Trip Advisor!

Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
Have enjoyed using while traveling along the east coast. Highly recommend the download.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5
This is a great app! I've paid for more expensive hotels at times assuming they would be nicer - cleaner, better amenities- only to be disappointed. Now with other travellers' reviews at my fingertips, I can get the best price on the best hotels!

I happened to find Trip Advisor by accident through Facebook. However I am happy I did. It has been helpful when planning my time abroad. The only bad thing I can find is that like any other comment based advice system, you get mixed comments and it can be confusing at times. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know about the things happening in whatever place they are getting ready to visit.
Version 5.9 2011-12-29 5

Great app and is very user friendly!
Version 5.9 2011-12-28 4
This app is wonderful. Used it to find some very unique restaurants that I wouldn't have ever tried. The reviews did not steer me wrong. Used the app when I was out traveling when the place we were going to go to didn't seem too great.  Found a different place in seconds and it was wonderful. Sure some areas don't have many reviews especially in rural areas. But the more people use trip advisor and leave reviews the better it's going to get.
Version 5.9 2011-12-28 5
That about says it. Am finding instant gratification in putting my praise (and displeasure) to words. Finding out others experiences is so helpful, too.

Same interface and features as the mobile website, but worse. Try to jump one level back and it sends you all the way back to the home page where you have to start your search all over again. Stick to the web version and save the space on your phone.

Version 5.9 2011-12-26 5
This is why this app is cool: just booked a hotel through TA. Chose "street view" and was able to walk past the nearest restaurants in Paris with the ratings and reviews right there. Very convenient. Can't wait to check it all out in person.

The app works, but it's buggy (I got green screen with nothing on it a few times), displays flight prices in British pounds (even though I have United States set as my location) and, above all, I find the style to be lacklustre.

It's fine half the time and the other times it crashes after you wrote a huge review and get ready to post it only to be kicked out and end up losing all info to the pt you don't want to write it again. Plus you can only write reviews on things that they list. You can't add new sites, places, or things on your own.
Version 5.9 2011-12-24 5
This app has improved my travel and given me essential info when I needed it most. Lots of users gives me more accurate ratings, too.
Version 5.9 2011-12-24 4
I've only used this once on a recent trip to Fort Worth,TX. It seems to me that this app only shows some restaurants as there were no fast food joints that showed up for me. I'm not saying that this is a problem, but, if you are expecting this feature to show all restaurants, you may be disappointed.
Version 5.9 2011-12-17 4

Awesome app that complements tripadvisor's trusted reviews and info.
Version 5.9 2011-12-11 2
My number one need is searching for businesses before I travel. If I want SCUBA options in Cabo before I travel, the app is not able to find businesses I found online.  The search function is simply not intuitive enough.
Version 5.9 2011-12-11 4
Love this app! So easy to use!
Version 5.9 2011-12-11 5
The only travel app worth using. Honest and descriptive reviews of all the places you dream of visiting.

This is fab and I use it above all others.
Version 5.9 2011-12-11 4
This is great app and I use it all the time? That said, Trip Advisor itself needs a lot of help. There are too many 5 star and one star reviews. Reviews older than a year should be devalued.
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 5
The trip advisor app is super easy to use!
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 5
Boom!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 5
I just down loaded the, so I haven't really used it yet, but I really like the idea.
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 5
I just added this app last night, and I love it already!  I can always count on the Trip Advisor reviews, and this app makes it easier than ever to access them.
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 1
Will not update after reviewing and modifying flight data. Screen stays blank and green indefinitely. Wifi strength not the issue, strong home signal. Not sure how to correct the problem, but makes this app unusable. Delete and reinstall did not work.
Version 5.9 2011-12-10 5
This is a perfect website to gauge the quality of a hotel. The reviews are invaluable!  Brava!

This is worth getting, much smoother navigation than vs. Safari. If they integrate Direction functionality it will be a 5 star travel app.

Amizing !!

Before I do anything or go anywhere I check my Trip Advisor App lots of reviews, pictures, and ratings. I would recommend it to everyone.

Antes de contratar un hotel siempre vemos que comentarios tiene en tripadvisor
Version 5.9 2011-12-09 5
I just looked at tripadvisor for the first time today but already I can see it is going to be quite a useful tool. I have found very interesting things around where I've lived all my life and never knew about. I just wish the site was more widely used with more reviews.
Version 5.9 2011-12-09 5
My wife and i depend on it a lot when making our traveling decisions
Version 5.9 2011-12-09 5
One of the best app for travelers. I highly recommend it.

One of the easiest and best running apps I've used!!!
Version 5.9 2011-12-09 5
Very handy and great information at your fingertip
Version 5.8 2011-12-09 5
Trip advisor helps you find hotels, food places, etc. You can find the best places to go. Some are more than others but it is your decision if you want to spend the money on expensive hotels. 

If I did not have trip advisor I would not be staying at the nicest hotels, food places, etc. 

If you do not have trip advisor get it today.
Version 5.9 2011-12-09 4
Such a practical, well deigned and easy to navigate app. A traveller's true advisor.
Version 5.9 2011-12-09 4
I'm planning my first big trip and this app has been totally useful.
Version 5.9 2011-12-09 4
Diggin it.
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 4
The app is super useful for getting reviews and pictures of lodging and activities. I use it all the time when planning trips, especially to warn me away from nasty or unpleasant surprises. 

It's been extremely helpful in planning trips to Europe, Seattle, NYC, and Maui, especially when trying to see the decor and room setup of various condos and hotels or trying to avoid places with bedbugs. It's also a great tool to check against the recommendations you find in guidebooks and on other travel sites, and is great if you combine the activity recommendations with sites like viator.com.
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5
I have used trip advisor for 7 years and love it!  I have posted many reviews and they have been viewed a lot. I recommend it highly.  Be sure to read as many reviews as you can and weigh them.  Different strokes for different folks..so be open to new experiences when you travel with trip advisor..
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5
Trying to find pics of a room online in the hotels site did not find any but found them here 5 stars!!!! Keep up te good work!!!! Love it
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5
I rely first and foremost on Trip Advisor for hotel and restaurant reviews.  My husband and I love to travel in the tropics.  We live in the Virgin Islands and know how spotty reviews can be in tropical settings, so we read Trip Advisor extensively as well as a guide book or 2 (usually Lonely Planet and Frommer's). Trip advisor is accurate, you get the good, bad and the ugly.  Sort out yourself which are rose colored glasses types versus nothing can please them types.
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5
Everything you need in one app.
Version 5.9 2011-12-08 5

The only thing I would like to have on the app is a link to all my reviews.
Version 5.9 2011-12-07 5
This is so helpful and came in handy. 
I was on a family vacation in palm springs and I lived about an hour away. I thought I knew my way around.... Well this app showed me I didn't know anything. 

Thanks for an awesome app.

I booked a one way trip for my Aunt to LAX the day her mother passed away for $135 using this app. She called at 4am crying because the the airport (Delta)  said she didn't have a ticket and it was never booked. I paid another charge of $350 for another one way with Delta. After checking my Visa I noticed I was charged for both tickets.

My go-to app when traveling. I check the reviews here before staying anywhere or doing anything!
Version 5.9 2011-12-01 1
It's been my experience apps like these that promise "fair and unbiased" reviews are neither. A point of fact; negative reviews of restaurants seem to magically disappear from this site and any such app that does that should raise an armada of red flags. Take their data with a half a grain of salt. I've tried places that have been featured using their "fair and unbiased" criteria. Let's just say someone is loading the cart with A LOT of BS.

The only reason I won't give this 5 stars is because you can't access your saved trips from your TripAdvisor account online. Wish they would link the two so when you save online you can get it on your phone.
Version 5.9 2011-11-30 5
I really love this app, without it, I may not think myself a tourist.

Trip advisor is like having a friend in the area, the travel business or food industry.
I heard that companies will review themselves, but on the whole, if you go with the consensus opinion, you will hit a home run.
Version 5.9 2011-11-30 5
I simply will not travel without checking trip advisor reviews

wanted to check out restaurants on our trip.  it was great to download Tripadvisors and have a listing of all of the restaurants on the island and having them rating.  Wonderful App.
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
Very powerful thing and what's important that hotels and restaurants teams are really worry about their reputation here so they are trying to improve provided services for us to get better reviews )))
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 4
The trip advisor app is superb. Concise and convenient is the best one can say.  Even for those who may be skeptical about the objectivity of it's reviews. Considering it's with you all of the time ad is your phone. Who knows when you'd use this handy app.  An unexpected diversion to a strange city or a last minute business trip.
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
Fabulous app!  I have been very satisfied with the ease of use and how accurate the information is. I'm also grateful for the reviews on places I go!  Thank you!

I typed in New Orleans as the city I wanted to travel too and the results showed flights to New York.  Wrong city and state!
Version 5.8 2011-11-29 5
There is really no other app that has such great information for researching hotels, restaurants and activities in an area. On numerous occasions I have used the app to help me make reservations on the fly. No other app gives a full circle experience of first finding what is around me, then giving me the tools to educate myself on different options, and then booking directly through the application
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
Love TripAdvisor. Very happy with the iPad app so far. The app is rather insistent about getting a rating, so this five-star rating comes after limited use. That said, it's free and I very much appreciate the app.
Version 5.9 2011-11-29 5
We have been on the road for several days and was happy to find app after visiting the website checking reviews. We have used it every day since finding it. It is a great help to have the map available immediately for your selection.

I use trip advisor often, so I was glad to see an iPad app option.  I prefer apps over websites for 90% of my most frequented sites. The trip advisor app is clumsy, and not as flexible .  It is useful for places you are, not so much for places you want to check out.

Am new to TripAdvisor.  Have found the App useful, especially the reviews.  Not sure why it dumps me back at the beginning of my search...probably inadvertently tapping something, but not sure.

We have had a new restaurant in the place of Ameci Pizzeria for last 2 years but the info hasn't been updated on this app.  With this said, I love the info you get about any place with such great ease.
Version 5.9 2011-11-28 5
Just like the website, the app has a lot of useful information that helps make informed decisions when traveling and looking for  hotel or just looking for a place to eat near home.  The reviews give a lot of real insight and the app is easy to use.  The app crashed a few minutes after I installed it, but I rebooted and have not had a problem since.

The split screen is great for familiarizing yourself with everything geographically.
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 5
I love trip advisor. Anytime I go on a website like Orbitz, Expedia, Priceline, etc. to book a hotel trip, I always use trip advisor first to see real customer photos and reviews of a hotel instead of only seeing the professional photos found on other sites. Therefore, when I found out that they have an app just like the regular website, I quickly downloaded it.
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 5
Very useful and user-friendly!

Easy to use - great info same as browser version. Keep up good work!
Version 5.9 2011-11-26 3
Great app but at least 1/3 of the places on here (restaurants) are closed, time to update records and actually look into people reporting things closed and wrong addresses.

Great for out of town trips and unplanned vacations other then the above mentioned.

It's as good as the name implies... I really enjoyed and never regretted buying this app... A simple app to use.. If you are serious about trips and don't have the time to be asking people your way around, then trip adviser is your escort...
Version 5.9 2011-11-24 1
You could say the earth is flat and they'd post it. Who knows what's true?! Emails are ignored when letting them know that things are coincidentally listed twice. There's no supervising of the site when contributors add pics of their kids and pets in the "Things To See" category.  It's ridiculous.
Version 5.9 2011-11-24 5

Version 5.9 2011-11-23 4
I really liked the app; my only problem was that it kept sending me back to my current location and offered no simple way to bookmark, and not even MRU list. While that might be great for on-the-spot use, it's not great for planning.

We just returned from a fantastic trip through Bhutan. Our guide, Karma, works for different companies, but also has a company of his own, Bhutan Herders. 
Karma has a great knowledge of the history of Bhutan. His is highly educated and his English superb. He is flexible, easy to get along with and created great hikes for us throughout Bhutan. Next time we visit we will do a trek with Karma, which is his specialty. Can't recommend him enough.

Option to save attractions to a list was nice, but this list is kept separate from lists you create on the website. You can't do your research on the laptop & then access that list from the phone.  Can't zoom in on photos. Great reviews, but I expect more functionality in the app.
Version 5.9 2011-11-22 5
I find TA to be an invaluable source of information for all travel. Love that travelers can share opinions and help guide one another out here in the big world of travel options.

I got this app while on my honeymoon in Italy, and man has it been on the money! Where to eat, where to visit, what tours to take. With reviews pictures and maps, this quickly became an invaluable resource to have on our trip. So far, we have used it for booking tours and finding GOOD places to eat. Helping us avoid the tourist traps and scams you will most definitely find when you travel to heavy tourist destinations. Not bad for a free App. It has even encouraged me to add to the reviews to make our voice count when someone is out there looking for advise.
Version 5.9 2011-11-21 5
Tons of info right at your fingertips without having to be near a computer. All the info of the online site in the palm of your hand.

I totally depend on My Trip Advisor .....we just got back from London,Rome, Bolognia, Venice, and Perugia....a terrific 3 week trip...and had a wonderful time.....my Trip App was used on a daily basis. It provided guidance and helped us make the most of our time.  I love my Trip Advisor App...I give it a 10 out of 10!
Version 5.9 2011-11-21 5
If I could have only one travel app - this would be it. The hotel ratings are spot-on and hotel owners that "get it" pay attention to their reviews here. No marketing fluff- just candid reviews from people like you.
Version 5.9 2011-11-20 2
Look for flights for two people, shows results giving impression that prices are for two...wrong, go to book it, price was for one! Why then ask if you are searching for more than one ticket?!

Love the convenience.

Trip Advisor is my 'go to' travel partner.  I always check with their site before I commit to any trip.  Thanks for being there!
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 4
Very useful tool, especially to pinpoint exact location of hotels, read reviews and compare price/ value.
However it annoyed me that for booking you need to use external links. And one has to start search over.

I've used trip advisor a few times before traveling to Philippines and Hong Kong.  By doing my research I was able to decide the best hotel for my wife and I.  Also found great tips from other users on best way to get to attractions or if the attraction was worth seeing.  My last trip to Hong Kong was so much better and convenient than when I went the first time which was a nightmare. I wish I had known of this site the first time I went.  So great job to all that participate with their comments, opinions and tips.

did not find the restaurant I was looking for and offered no way to submit it. starts sending me email I don't want and can't find out how to turn off notifications. the web access found more restaurants than the dedicated app, and ad more features for narrowing searches. seems like waste to install the app.

We have used Trip Advisor for finding hotels as we travel by car, and have used it locally in New England and found it to be quite helpful. I tried to rely on it for our trip to Ft Lauderdale and it was surprisingly not relevant to wrong! A restaurant that was highly rated by Trip Advisor in Deerfield beach wasn't even there any more, a highly rated botanical garden in Davie was in a state of disrepair and reeked of urine, a hotel in Boca Raton was sorely stale. Maybe the star ratings need to have a restricted time element?
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5
Thank you for this helpful app!  I got good information for my recent trip to Tahiti including lists of what to pack and places to see.  Because of high prices and limited availability of over the counter meds, sun block, batteries, etc., this app helped prepare us for the trip.  Now, we are on Maui and are reading reviews and viewing pictures to help us decide which restaurants to try.
Version 5.9 2011-11-19 5

Good.
Version 5.9 2011-11-09 3
I thought this app would be all that I would need to use to plan a trip, but it is lacking in many ways. I've listed what I found to be its strengths and weaknesses:

Strengths: 
- Plenty of detailed reviews for each item and summaries similar to iTunes. 
- Most items include ample photos. 
- Links to hotel websites for many items
- Zoomable map, although it keeps resetting itself at the slightest touch

Weaknesses:
- Only includes a small fraction of the lodging choices at the locations I have needed. 
- Lodging categorized (often incorrectly) as "hotel", "B&Bs/Inns", and "other" with no way to look at all choices at once or exclude some categories. 
- You can save (favorite) a hotel, but not a location or search. 
- FAR too many personal photos or photos of attactions in the area rather than the hotel itself.

Features which would be helpful: 
- Map to plot a route and record an itinerary
- Intuitive recommendation feature based on a combination of survey answers and choices at destinations along the route or previous trips
Version 5.9 2011-11-09 5

I agree with everyone that loves this app!  In traveling across America this Nov 2011 it helped soooo much in where to stay and more importantly where not to.  I do wish it could store a record of previous info but other than that I highly recommend it.
Version 5.9 2011-11-07 5
I've been using Trip Advisor for several years as my main source of info for European travel. The iPad app is very well designed and makes it even easier to find what I'm looking for. Reviews are very useful and information is timely. Highly recommended--but as one other reviewer noted, you have to have wifi access (which is not always available), so plan ahead.
Version 5.9 2011-11-07 5

This is so handy. I never thought they had one like this app. I like it showing how many miles you are from the place. I would recommend it for anybody.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
I find this app and it's services invaluable. No problems with it so far!
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
I am planning a trip to New York and have spent weeks researching and downloading apps. This is by far the best overall resource and the advice from members is invaluable.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 3
When looking for a specific restaurant or one that serves just breakfast it is not very good.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
Very handy and the best tool I know to search traveling hints.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
I have almost never been led astray by the reviews on TripAdvisor.
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
While traveling this past week had bad experience  staying at treasure island las Vegas. I mentioned this to the person sitting next to me on my flight she suggested this app and explained what it's used for, I'm glad that I was able to vent my frustration and maybe help someone this is a great app for information!
Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
Love this app!

Version 5.9 2011-11-06 5
I I have not been using the app long, but it is becoming my go-to app for travel recommendations. Easy and intuitive the app helps me get to where I want to go and helps me steer clear of where I do not want to go...

Version 5.9 2011-11-05 5
Terrific resource. Very helpful in finding restaurants and tour resources on a recent trip to Argentina. While tour books were useful, TripAdvisers info was more current and we felt we found better restaurants than tour books told us about. Also helped us rank what we wanted to see in Buenos Aires. Great app.
Version 5.8 2011-11-05 4
Pls add function to display multiple saved sites with option to search for directions among them, thanks.

This is everything you need to plan a trip. My boyfriend and I are going to the Keys next week and this has been invaluable in our planning process.

I relied on this app to plan a recent trip to Vancouver and couldn't be happier. We saw the best of the city in just a short weekend.
Version 5.9 2011-11-04 5
We use Trip Advisor for every adventure we plan. Great being able to compare rates on lodging and flights. They don't have all the options, but are always helpful with photos, attractions and ratings submitted by their users.
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
It was just a complicated phone with benefits until I was traveling and wanted to find a very good, very close restaurant- TA app was a revelation. Why can't all apps be this easy & useful?
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
Never ever leave home without consulting tripadvisor
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 1
This could be soooo much better, I would pay for a better more detailed local view of activities and things to do. 
I can us the Internet to find what you have here, I want local stuff with ratings. 
Sorry,  for the 1 star It would not go negative.
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
My wife and I were searching for a hotel while traveling up the I-75 towards Tennessee and this app was all I needed to quickly search for a hotel at a great price, read consumer reviews and check availability. Highly recommended for the iPhone 4.
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5
It's a must have!
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5

I recently started traveling more and a friend showed me this app. After starting to use it, I have come to rely on it more and more. One downside would be that it doesn't always display all options a given area.
Version 5.6 2011-11-02 5
I have found this little app packed full of useful info.  It's even got places of interest close to us that I had no idea existed and I've lived here 54 years!  We love this app, I use it all the time. Thanks to the designer and those who created it, well done!!
Version 5.9 2011-11-02 5

Version 5.9 2011-11-01 4
Needs more requirements to evaluate with quality, speed, cost, safety, service being added or incorporated.
Version 5.8 2011-11-01 5
I have found Trip Advisor to be very useful. Access to data and reviews while traveling is important to where you most need them. I found it to be a valuable resource on a recent trip.
Version 5.8 2011-11-01 5
I use TripAdvisor often to plan trips and tell others about gems unearthed.  You should have this app loaded if you travel.
Version 5.9 2011-11-01 5

Great informations to everybody.
Version 5.9 2011-10-31 5
Most comprehensive analysis of hotel and restaurant options. The maps are very helpful and are other dated reviews for recency.
Version 5.9 2011-10-31 4
Trip Advisor is an excellent source when traveling. When reading the reviews you get a good insight to each establishment. But you must take the majority of reviews as the norm. Check the percentages of excellent to poor and make your judgement on the majority.
Version 5.9 2011-10-31 4
Useful app while you're on vacation or traveling. The "near me" feature needs some refining, as it will pull up things in different towns. I like being able to upload pictures of the hotels, food, or whatever from my phone.
Version 5.9 2011-10-31 4
Simple and easy to use. ALOT of info...

Version 5.8 2011-10-30 1
Disappointed to put my town in for restaurants and get a list including Denny's and the local ice cream stand, when there are good places to eat around here.
Version 5.9 2011-10-30 5
Great app..very helpful
Version 5.9 2011-10-30 3
As more people submit reviews, it will get better. I found the listings for restaurants where I was staying in Barbados limited. When I searched Near Me from my hotel in Rockley, it listed only 3, leaving out restaurants that wee in the system if searched by name (specifically Tapas was not listed). 

Also, desperately needs feature that lets you read your own reviews. Otherwise, it is hard to confirm that your reviews actually got posted.
Version 5.8 2011-10-29 5
The wealth of travel information  is invaluable.  There isn't anything you can't find.   The app is easy to use.   Definitely one app to have if you love to travel.

I have been able to do all that I do on a pc on my iPad with this app. Works well, nicely organized and good photo resolution.
Version 5.8 2011-10-29 4
I have used the recs almost every time I travel. Aware that all are not authentic, I basically find the reviews useful. Traveling I-95 from NY to FL 3-4 times per year, I have had my share of horrible Motel experiences. Since using Trip Advisor I have no horrendous experiences. SC is particularly challenging; I appreciate the warnings.
Version 5.8 2011-10-29 5

I used to jump back and forth between various websites & apps to "compile" all the info I wanted, but this app has it all (interactive labeled map, hot links, reviews, dine/play, things to see / attractions, etc) and now I only need this one go-to app. And it is very up-to-date as well. Highly recommend for all travel needs, especially to new cities.

The app is a must for any traveler. You'll find reliable reviews for hotels and restaurants from fellow travelers for where your trip takes.

Have been using my Trip Advisor app for the past three months while traveling to unfamiliar destinations. It has been invaluable in selecting the right accommodations and restaurants. So far...this is a "five star" app in my opinion!!! Check it out!!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-24 2
I will give a 5 stars as soon I will be able to share any hotel I find in this apps to my friends and I would like to be able to get phone #' fax # or email add this way I can reach someone at the hotel before booking and also I would like to be able to see the price as one of the first thing on the page. So I thing this update can be done and hopefully others people would like that too???

Just heard about this app and used during a weekend getaway to Asheville, NC. Reviews on restaurants, hotels, and things to do were dead-on and liked how it allowed you to search by ratings or by proximity.

What a big help, I travel a lot for work, gets me all the ratings.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 4
This is my go to app when I'm traveling. I also like Yelp when I want to search specifically in a smaller area. A couple of things keep me from giving it five stars. Some of the restaurant and event pages need more thorough information including hours and links to web pages, which are frequently lacking and inconsistent. But this is still the best app out there and I find the reviews more reliable than those on Yelp.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
Just found out about this web site and it is great. Big help with hotels.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5

Great app for traveling and accessing hotel options on the go....would rate 5 if you listed the direct phone number to hotel .
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
Love this app..can't count the number of times we've made choices based on reviews we've read there. Seems every place in every town has been covered! Thanks, guys.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 4
I downloaded this just in time for my trip to Europe and it was one of the best decisions I've made so far. Super helpful, easy to use, and the TripAdvisor users haven't steered us wrong yet!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
The app is very intuitively laid out and makes finding anything very quick and easy.  Love it!

As a frequent tracker, trip advisor is my bible and never steamed me wrong. I look up everything on it and nice to h e a phone app since carrying a large lap top just seems to be to much.  Thank you TA for keeping up with the times.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5

I travel quite a bit! NewZealand to St.Peters burgh Russia,Cuba,Alaska, and many, many places all over the world & the U.S.Sometimes driving, sometimes flying, and sometimes cruising . I love reading the reviews of other travelers, and have gotten and used a lot of very good information. I also enjoy sharing my travel adventures with others! This app does it all. It gets and gives lots of really good thoughts and ideas ! I refer to it a often. It definitely helps to satisfy my "curiosity "! It's a big and fabulous world out there to be explored! Thanks "Trip Advisor" for being so helpful!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
Practically stayed In PJ's our whole stay! Super relaxing, comfy, clean, not to mention ...romantic! Very nice place to stay. Don't expect the Four Seasons here, this is rustic, open air, wildlife, tall pines ...New Mexico, you'll love it. Staff was very nice, in fact once they knew we were celebrating anniversary, included a complimentary bottle of champagne, wonderful! 
Okay I gotta go .....I'm planning my next trip to SBC!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
This app is so helpful when planning a trip, I don't know how we ever planned trips without it.

Great tool to find hotels and restaurants!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 4
I really like trip advisor, it's very helpful in planing a vacation, however it would get 5 stars if I could save my place. I will be on pic 107 of a resort when I put my phone down and when I cone back I have to start at pic 1. I don't want to keep seeing the same 100 photos because I don't have 5 hours at one sitting to see them all. Same with reviews. Even if they added a search option that would make it better.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5
Photos look fantastic on this app.
Version 5.8 2011-10-22 5

Version 5.8 2011-10-21 4
Helpful to see what people think but you also need to look at it for the average answer not the extreme on either end.
Version 5.8 2011-10-21 4

A travel site MUST for anyone who travels further than 10 minutes from home.
Version 5.8 2011-10-19 4
Stops working and closes if there is no Internet connection. Really annoying in places with weak signal...
Version 5.8 2011-10-19 3
I have used a few times and up to now it works good. Though sometimes it doesn't provide the web sites for all hotels. I will try to use it more and probably next time I will have a rounder observation to make.
Version 5.8 2011-10-19 4
Easy to use and very helpful.  Love the map that shows you exactly where the restaurant is.

Tripadvisor is the FIRST resource we look at when looking for places to stay or eat and things to do when we are on the road!
Version 5.8 2011-10-18 5
How could a travel app be so realistic and well developed that it makes you want to run to the airport and hop on the next flight to go exactly where you know you you're going!!! Splendidly excellent!

The maps don't give any hint about their scale. I see my hotel and the surrounding restaurants but how far is it? 100 yards? 2 miles?
Version 5.8 2011-10-17 5
Using app now for vacation. Last minute things to do is great. Luv it & use it weekly

Ha sido la mejor ayuda que he encontrado en la web
Version 5.8 2011-10-17 5
O site nos deixa bastante informado. Obrigado
Version 5.8 2011-10-17 4
It is great site to get an opinion about your next destination. It works fine as to give you a general idea, but you need to read the reviews (the worst and the best) to understand the problems and whether it is of your concern or not. The site does not pre-qualify your concern (e.g. Noise, cleanness, etc...) to match the review automatically. Also the site did not order the hotels accordingly with the number of reviews, so you may get a Hotel that have an excellent review of few people and that none of them have the same concern as you have about noise for instance, so you may get a wrong impression and have a not so nice stay. We see many reviews where people refer for previous use of the site, and bad experience. Another limitation is it does not help you find accommodations for your family, like apart- hotels.
Version 5.8 2011-10-17 5
TripAdvisor is my go place before I book a room. It's the best!
Version 5.8 2011-10-17 5

I can't seem to get the whole page to show the map- I hate the menu to the left of map, plus where is the overview of the location? Some things are better ( the localized restaurant reviews) and some are not from the full web version.
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 5
Use app whenever you're traveling. Whether for business or personal, I can always find what I need. Love this app for planning out my travel.

Me and my wife went to New Orleans on our anniversary and glad we used it wished we had the app before we left. Due to the bad experience we had first night in a bad restaurant we knew it would be useful and is so far very helpful, thanks trip advisor and all that has joined this is one of the most useful apps on my iPhone.
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 4
So easy to use.
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 1
I tried to download, had to sign new iTunes agreement, then the app said it was downloading but then goes away from the iPhone.  App store says it's installed but it's not.
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 5
Easy to use and helpful.... The site it self is beautiful the app, is way better
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 4
This App is one that I use daily. Not only do I like the well thought out travel components, but I have become heavily dependent on the forums for their timely, reliable travel discussion.

Great job!
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 4
Useful when traveling, but it locks up once in a while. Need to look carefully at reviews as some people get too sentimental and loose objectivity. Very heful if you travel around a lot.
Version 5.6 2011-10-16 4
I like it and recommend for quick searches.
Version 5.8 2011-10-16 4

Version 5.8 2011-10-15 4
This app helped me find a hotel in a matter of minutes instead of taking forever to call every place to find availability. And it's free!
Version 5.8 2011-10-12 5
I am on the road 6 months of the year and find Tripadvisor a valuable goldmine of information. I could not travel and book the hotels and eat out without consulting it first. I have been in over 53 countries and this site seems to cover them all. Sincerely, Patrick Faiola, Honolulu and New York City.
Version 5.7 2011-10-11 5

A quick way to use Trip Advisor.
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 5
Great app. I've based several trips off this app/website alone...
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 4
Good app but should include hours seasons open and rates would make it perfect
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 4
As good as the website, now in the form of a very user-friendly app. It is almost the only app you will need for all your travel planning needs, but unfortunately it does not check low-cost airlines when searching for flights, which means you also need a flights app (e.g. momondo). If it wasn't for that, I would give it 5 stars and just call it perfect.
Version 5.8 2011-10-11 5
We travel a lot and this app is really helpful. I have been using google, but I find myself using trip-adviser much more often.

Went on a search for a restaurant and found one thru Trip Advisor which I didn't know they did restaurants and this app came up for it. So I gave it a try and love it because it gives you everything the address, directions, map and reviews on the restaurant or whatever you are looking for.Give it a try you won't be disappointed.

I usually spend so much time going from one website to the other when planning a vacation, which takes up a lot of time because I have to go back and forth between the sites and often forget what has been saved. This one allows me to save all my voices of hotels, restaurants and things to do in one site. One of, if not, the best App I have.

Version 5.8 2011-10-10 5
Everything you need to know about your trip is right here. I always check the ratings and reviews of real customers which i find very helpful. The site is easy to navigate. If you want to check restaurants nearby, you can easily do so. I check this site before i book for a hotel in most cases

Getting ready for a weekend trip into unfamiliar territory and found this app.  Wow! I have everything I need to make this a Fu trip.  Great travel tool!
Version 5.8 2011-10-08 5
We have used this app--in conjunction with Maps--to make plans on the fly and to make up for limited prior planning.  While it is a luxury for us--not a must--we will continue to loyally utilize this app and reap the associated time saving benefits.
Version 5.8 2011-10-08 5
Way easier to use than the website... And the website is pretty good!

I just got it n I love it already!!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5
As a former Travel Agent I find this site a must when visiting a new destination. I suggest reading 5 to 10 reviews to get a true picture. We have been very pleased with all of our selections using Tripadvisor.
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 4
Why have several apps when this one will do every thing they will do? It reliable and accurate and it is free. I can't ask for more. No complaints, only praise.
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 4
Works!
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 4
A diamond in the rough. Love using the live view. Can't wait for future version!!!
Version 5.6 2011-10-07 3
If you're looking up info this is an excellent app, but of you're entering info and can't log in easily, you're hosed an have to start over. A simple loop back to where I was reviewing would've been nice. Actual review interface is clumsy and non-intuitive. Lots of smaller, neighborhood restaurants missing from list.
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5
I love this app!!!
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5
This app is awesome... I use it frequently. I recommend it!

As an expat living in Kathmandu, Nepal for 7 years I thought I might be able to find other great places to go or visit or shop at but to my disappointment all the great attractions and places to eat and shopping destinations were not even on the lists! Even the hotels listed weren't even the good hotels but the gheto hotels. Where are they getting their information? I wanted to use this app to find the best places to visit in Delhi, India but I don't trust it. P.S. When I told it to find hotels near me (while sitting in my home in Kathmandu) it came up with hotels in Kenya! Then when I tried to reset it it told me of a hotel that is 16 hour drive from my home. Come on...get your maps strait!
Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5
Perfect App for planning trips. Easy to find hotels and restaurants around the area you plan on staying at. Definite must have app.

Version 5.8 2011-10-07 5
It helped us find a hotel and restaurants around it.
Version 5.4 2011-10-07 5
I trust Trip Advisor. It has real pictures from real customers, not industry hacks paid to fluff up reviews.  I have trusted the information thatTrip Advisor offers for travel to 4 countries (so far) and have felt that I know what to expect before I arrive - invaluable.

Version 5.8 2011-10-04 5
I love flipping through actual traveler reviews. I'm much more likely to listen to normal people like me as opposed to travel writers. Haven't really found any issues with it yet. Will keep looking :)

A tiny bit cumbersome maneuvering the app, but eventually all info is there to access.

Scrub jdjdand Fire          || TOP ||
In the pre-settlement landscape, scrub systems were maintained by periodic fires. Scrub fires were often intense. Oaks, saw palmetto, and shrubs in the heath family sprout after burning. Scrub dominated by these sprouting species recovers rapidly after fire with little change in species composition. Sand pine is killed by fire, but sand pine has serotinous (closed) cones that open and drop seeds after being heated by fire. Florida rosemary and some other species regenerate from seed stored in the soil. Longleaf pine is well adapted to fire; mature trees survive most fires, and grass-stage juveniles are fire resistant. Mature slash pine (South Florida variety) survive many fires; juvenile slash pine are more vulnerable to fire mortality

Scrub animals avoid fire in burrows (e.g., gopher tortoise) or move out of the way (e.g., scrub jay)

Without fire:

Habitat structure becomes unsuitable for scrub jays
Herbs used for food by gopher tortoises decline
Bare ground needed for pine reproduction is absent
Openings required by rare plants decline
Sand Pine Burning

Love trip advisor and the app works great too! However sometimes it doesn't recognize other searchable items other than restaurants or hotels or destinations. Like if you want to read reviews on a travel company it's hard to find on the app. But If you're using an iPhone then just looking it up online works. Great app though. You can even save favorites for quick navigation.
Version 5.8 2011-09-29 5
So often, "optimized for the web" = reduced functionality. Not so with TripAdvisor. It actually works better on my iPhone than the regular site and gives me everything I need to plan my trips in advance as well as on the fly when I'm at my destination. The Save feature is terrific, and you can view Eats, Things to Do, or Sleeps either by user rating or distance from a selected spot (say, your hotel). Just download it--you'll be glad.

This app is amazing! It's authentic & honest & was an incredible help during my trip in Ireland. I used it to locate 3 different hotels and B&Bs on the spot and was never disappointed. I love that it lists the average prices of rooms (also accurate) as well as the hotel's standing in the area (e.g. #4 out of 130 hotels) and gives you easy access to pics and reviews. I highly recommend this app to anyone, particularly when traveling overseas.

Find a good travel agent who has 10+ yrs experience . Too many choices.  This is an online travel agency anyhow n they make u do all the work. Then get commissions.
Version 5.8 2011-09-25 5
I use Trip Advisor all the time. I have never been steered wrong since the reviews are from real people. You learn to spot the bad reviews from the sour pusses from the honest reviews that ordinary people give.  I travel frequently and always check out hotels and restaurants before I go there. If it has consistent bad reviews, I stay away. The app is very user friendly.

zip code, put in a search with your choice off the menu. Everything you need is right at your 
finger tips. I get the address and put it in the map app that comes with all Apple produces , 
and I'm there.I love the fact that everyone writes a review on Trip, so finding the best is easy .
 I love , love this app !!!!!!!

An app you can trust in
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 5
I love it.
Version 5.5 2011-09-23 4
Also hard to provide feedback and most of the time goes to a black hole. 
BUT, what other app is out there that will give you a good list to brainstorm? Get it.
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 4
You should download this app, especially for overseas travel.  Tripadvisor seems to be most handy when it comes to lodging reviews and ratings.
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 5
Thanks, it is nice apps.
Version 5.8 2011-09-23 5
Definitely saves time over the real website. Love it!

I've used this for many trips and it comes in very helpful and has taken me to some awesome places:)!
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 2
My main complaint is that for some reason this app does not find all the hotels in a town or city and it doesn't allow you to search nearby towns or cities to expand your search. Ot would be nice to search by map like their website. Finally, when I go to their website from my phone it brings up their app! Very frustrating when you are on the road.
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 5
Use it for restaurants, hotels, and resorts. Love reading the reviews before making a decision. Found it to be reliable outside of the U.S.
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 4
It is the best five apps in my device!

A really easy to navigate site. I particularly like the lower fare alert feature.
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 4
love all the ratings and pics that come up as soon as I hit search!
Version 5.7 2011-09-22 3
A reasonably good app that provides some good recommendations and some tourist traps; however, no more so that other travel sites.  useful for a general idea of where to stay and eat but get some second opinions/ do some additional searching on your own.
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 4
It's so easy with all the good info
Version 5.8 2011-09-22 5

Just got back from a cruise on Emerald Princess. what a wonderful cruise! This was the last cruise of the season and the weather pretty much held up. MY wife and I opted out of all the Princess excursions. We opted for the hop on hop off bus in several of the ports. However we did book a two day tour with Red October tours on the Internet about six months prior to the cruise. This was a private one on one tour of Saint Petersburg. This was by far the best money we spent on our vacation. Katherine our tour guide taught at the Unv. Of St. Petersburg with classes on Culture and History of Russia. We learned many entertaining things about Russia and it's Tsars. I would highly recommend this company.  We had two ten hour days that were all exclusive.

Tallinn, Estonian was a jewel of a city as was Arhaus Denmark. The entire cruise was wonderful. Only drawback was short days in the ports od Stockholm, Oslo and Arhaus.  Make sure you eat at Sabatinis on the Emerald. New menu go for the veal chop.

Seems like an unbiased perspective
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
This is such a handy app, at home, but especially traveling. I'll use it often. I've learned the value and now try to leave reviews myself, to help the next person.
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
I aleays find myself surfing the net on my phone and ending up at the Trip Advisor site, before realizing I have the app. Very convenient. I'd like to see a section about transportation: bus, subway, cab availability and prices would be helpful.
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
Thank you...
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 4
Useful app to have in your mobile device if you travel at all. Especially great to have if your plans deviate a little from the itinerary and you find yourself off course and needing a meal, accommodation or the like.

Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
I love TA whether it's the full website or the app the reviews are usually accurate and helpful!
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
Trip advisor was nice online. Hard to believe they could have improved it much. Well, they did.  Fast, intuitive, very thorough, great pics and reservation tie ins.  
Very nicely done Trip Advisor!  You made it to the coveted home page on my pad. Full five stars!
Version 5.8 2011-09-20 5
This app is very helpful for an infrequent traveler. I travel once in a while for work, this app helps me find good local restaurants.
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
I use the application to give me ideas of where to visit and I appreciate travelers reviews rather than a travel brochure.

It is a great app. I should have discovered it sooner, use it when traveling far away or too near by cities!
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
This app gives viewers information about things to do, stay, eat, etc. making it a must use app if one does a lot of traveling. Interesting info.
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
Any time I need to get pertinent and quality information on a place I will be visiting I  come to trip advisor.  I know I can trust these reviews and when I go some place I try to put up my own reviews so it's a give and take relationship.
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
Use this app before during and after all my trips! Easy to use and informative!
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 5
We use Trip Advisor to check out lodging and restaurants and find the reviews very reliable.  Aside from the occasional person with an ax to grind, I find the reviews right on the money though I always check the dat written.  It seems things can change pretty quickly for the better or worse in the hospitality industry.
Version 5.8 2011-09-19 4

I could not live without my trip advisor. We just came back from an incredible trip to Italy and I did it all through trip advisor. The hotels, where to go, places to eat, everything was perfect except I wish I had more time. I am now planing our next trip and now it is even easier.  Thanks trip advisor.
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
I love trip advisor because I am all about options, it gives me that. Sure you want to travel on x-dates but here's a few other prices should you be flexible and save a few bucks! Love it.
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
Amazing app finds all the cheapest flights. Makes this a huge convenience as opposed to searching online. Easy to use.

Version 5.8 2011-09-17 5
No complaints..works as advertised. Trusted info and great depth of info
Version 5.8 2011-09-17 4
it's a great tool for finding a hotel that fits one's budget and travel plan. It'd be better if it allowed users to tag or bookmark a hotel or places in every stage of seach.

I've had the app installed for quite sometime. Today, I used it for the first time. Helped with all my needs.
Version 5.8 2011-09-16 1
Just loaded the app and it isn't anywhere near as easy to use as on my computer. Guess it takes some getting used to, however I thought that it would be easier.
Version 5.8 2011-09-16 5
Great for trip planning especially transportation. If you're a traveller I think you'd be really foolish not to have and use
Version 5.8 2011-09-16 5
Don't remember how I traveled without it.  Great for trip planning and equally useful to find a great place to eat when I haven't planned ahead of time.

Lovin it!
Version 5.8 2011-09-15 5
Great app for finding hotels and restaurants. The fact that real people apparently review each review before it appears on TripAdvisor helps weed out shills and impostors, making reviews that much more dependable.
Version 5.8 2011-09-15 5
Best travel app I have seen.  Easy to use, great mapping. You can go from reviews of your neighborhood restaurants to the best spots outside Paris or Hong Kong. Travel Advisor is a travelers best friend!

Has proven invaluable in making smart decisions about what to do and more importantly what not to do.  The restaurant and activity reviews are spot on.  I contribute by making my share of reviews, good, excellent and not so good.  Do your fair share and let your experience be know.
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
Love this app! Used it extensively while planning an Oregon road trip. Hard to believe it's a free.
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
Easy to use, fun to navigate. It's nice to be able to review a location right after you leave. It saved the last info I tied to enter before I lost Internet access,so that's a plus.

Tripadvisor is a great help. Loving this app!

Trip advisor is an excellent resource when I'm on the road.   I use it daily for recommendations regarding lodging and restaurants that for the most part have been dead on.
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
So great while traveling. A must have.
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
Very usefull...
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5
I love trip advisor. Helps decision making a lot easier. People must realize though before making a decision about a place read all reviews. I think some people are in plain bad moods when they rate places and they couldn't be more wrong. When reading mixed reviews it sometimes seems like people are talking about 2 different places. Trip Advisor is a great tool.
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 4
Seems like a good app but I wish I could log in to leave reviews from my TA user account like I can when on a computer
Version 5.8 2011-09-14 5

Version 5.8 2011-09-13 4
I have been using Trip Advisor for most of my travel making decisions and really love the functionality of the web site. So I was a little skeptical about the app. It's actually better than I thought, all the information is there. You just have to get used to using the app so you can easily find that information. 4 out of 5

Reliable information and easy to use
Version 5.8 2011-09-13 3
Con Trip, puedo conocer y valorar lugares que no sabian que existian y que se encuentran muy cerca del lugar adonde me encuentro. Casi siempre las criticas son criteriosas aun que a veces no concuerdo con alguna de ellas. P ej. Comparan hoteles muy pequenios y mal ubicados con otros que se encuentran en la misma ciudad, mucho mejor equipados , y le Dan mas valor en su calificacion, confundiendo asi a Los usuarios pero eso solo se comprende al llegar al destino.
Version 5.8 2011-09-13 5

This app works for me especially when I'm on the road and need a quick reference.   I like how it rates everything so you can make pretty decent decisions.
Version 5.8 2011-09-08 5
Love this app for ease of use and wealth of info at your finger tips.
Version 5.8 2011-09-08 3
I like this app a lot but I live in Maputo, Mozambique and of the restaurants listed most of the ones I looked at on the map were misplaced even though the addresses seemed to be correct. Wish there was an option to request to move the map location like there is in Google Earth. There's only the option to let them know that the address is incorrect.
Version 5.8 2011-09-08 4
Just downloaded the app and loving it already ... So easy to use and I like the pictures...
Only one thing: I can't check the availability of the rooms... Or maybe I just didn't try yet lol

This works like the full app. A major disappointment is that you can't save recommended places. I'd like to keep a list of restaurants for instance and then see which I encounter and I may not want to use phone minutes when traveling and may be somewhere with no wifi
Version 5.7 2011-09-07 4
The clean interface makes effortless the task of finding an interesting restaurant, hotel, etc.
Version 5.8 2011-09-07 4

The trip advisor app is fantastic..especially when your trying to find a good place to go while on the road.
Version 5.8 2011-09-07 5
I always go to trip advisor first when planning. I have found so many good pieces of advice for places I would never have visited otherwise. Everything I want to know is in one place, and the personal comments are so helpful. I have started to write reviews lately myself, if for no other reason than in gratitude for the help others have given me. Try it and see!
Version 5.8 2011-09-06 5

Version 5.8 2011-09-06 5
I had to travel suddenly and downloaded this app.  I've been very happy with every restaurant and site that I've been to that I looked up on trip advisor.
Version 5.6 2011-09-06 5
I've used all the travel sites, many times, TripAdvisor is BY FAR the fastest loading & most easily navigated & up to date comparisons of flight costs & times.  Used it in Europe as well to find inexpensive flights on some of the smaller airlines.  I love the notes by users & tips, as often the best finds are from individuals rather than from travel guides.
Version 5.8 2011-09-06 5
Works just like the pc version.
Version 5.8 2011-09-06 5
This is a great app. Perfect for planning a trip and easier to navigate back and fourth than the actual website. I was able to check reviews, view photos and then with a quick click go right to local attractions and things to do with reviews on those activities as well. Such a great way to plan trips I love it!
Version 5.8 2011-09-05 5

Great app very user friendly A+++
Version 5.8 2011-09-04 4
I travel for work and often am looking for quick information for the area around where I am staying. The "near me" and links make it useful. The only reason I didn't rate a 5 is sometimes the info is out and the user reviews are mixed with professional reviewers - usually biased.
Version 5.8 2011-09-04 5
Great and easy to use interface.
Version 5.8 2011-09-04 5

I just recently downloaded the app and have had great fun exploring the world of travel and getting ideas.  So far I haven't made any reservations oe followed through on any recommendations, but will do so in the next week or two.
Version 5.8 2011-09-03 5
The TA App is great because it gives you all the most helpful info, including distance from where you are at any given time...  One click to open table reservations, one click to restaurant websites.  I highly recommend this App.
Version 5.7 2011-09-03 5
Besides being a travel agent I am a frequent traveler, and Tripadvisor has been a great tool to find all travel related places, hotels and sites anywhere I go. A careful reading has given me incredible findings I never expected, but most of all has helped me to give a better advise to my clients.   Bravo for all the readers and writers that has made this website a leader in travel.
Version 5.4 2011-09-02 5

A great reference tool but if there are insufficient reviews it's difficult to get an accurate rating. I've used Trip Advisor for some five years now and wholeheartedly recommend it.

This make traveling so much more enjoyable.
Version 5.8 2011-09-02 1

We are traveling to Europe this September and have used trip advisor for hotels, restaurants and more.  would have been lost without trip advisor !

Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
Trip Advisor is indispensable on the PC and now with this app. Ratings and reviews nearly always right on. If you travel you need this.
Version 5.6 2011-09-01 5
I can't imagine traveling anywhere without consulting Trip Advisor.   This is THE BEST!
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
After discovering trip adviser about two years ago it still boggles my mind on how many people use it.
being the property manager for a small shopping center on Marco island, and being on site daily I constantly hear people talking about how they read the reviews and had to check out the shops. We have one shop (simply cupcakes) that say they're getting about 70% of their business from trip adviser. It amazes me daily. Thank you from our tenants, they wouldn't survive without it.
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5
Really a great and useful app!!!
Version 5.8 2011-09-01 5

Version 5.8 2011-08-30 2
The app would be great if it performed better. Frequent crashes, stalls, etc., and also a UI that isn't as useful as the TA website, led me to give up and use Yelp instead. It's a great idea, but having a mobile experience that's so much worse than the website seems like a real problem for a service of this nature. (Referring to both iPhone and iPad apps).
Version 5.8 2011-08-30 5
I am so thankful for trip advisor, especially on an iPad. I have been traveling the world for over 1.5 years and really believe it is important to help other travelers whenever possible, not only to tell them where to go for a great experience, but also to save them from the pains of a bad experience. Great app...thank you!

This app is frustrating in that when you press the back button on the flight search all of your previous flight info that you entered is now gone and you have to re-enter it to modify your search. Why not make it simple to use!?

Trip Advisor is a solid app that I use every time I plan a trip.  App can be mildly annoying at times, mainly with the zoom on the map.  It would be helpful to keep a group of POI's on the map and not zoom in even while looking at a particular POI in detail.  One downside to Trip advisor is all the info is based on reviews thus uniform info is not necessarily provided for all POI's.  For example, in planning a trip to France, it would be helpful to know how far hotels are from train lines, however this is not always available.  Despite these faults, this app is very easy and has high yield info at your fingertips.
Version 5.8 2011-08-27 5

We used Trip advisor on our iPad to plan a one month trip to Morocco and Spain. With two notable exceptions all of our hotels cost less than $90, sometimes a lot less. I researched all the hotels in two days by reading the excellent reviews available on the Ap. We were not disappointed with any of them, and most exceeded our expectations. Once we were there we used Trip Advisor to find us restaurants, again,we were favorable impressed.

We are not inexperienced travelers, but this trip was the best organized and the one with the best value for the prices paid. That was all because of Trip Advisor and it's foolproof Ap. It never failed us.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5

I don't know whether is good or not because I just downloaded it and it doesn't work. I'm going to delete it.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
Everyone should have this app!!!
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 2
We often use Trip Advisor on vacation, so the app seemed like a natural. So far I am finding it difficult to find and read reviews - much less functional than the Web site. Even accounting for the format difference, this app just isn't worth the headache.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 4
This is a must have app
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
I really like, it was useful for finding a hotel
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
I have used this app while on vacation to find out about nearby hotels in order to plan next years vacation. I would recommend.
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5
Excellent
Version 5.8 2011-08-26 5

Great app
Version 5.7 2011-08-25 5
I use it all the time.
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 1
Hubby and I use TripAdvisor all the time.  It is the first place we come when we need to know anything about a new city we are traveling to.

   BUT!!!!!!!

I REALLY don't like this app.  The way it is set up is not reader friendly.  Reading reviews is difficult with the reviews on the left side of the screen and you are not able to expand it or make it bigger to read easily.  I will not be using this app unless this is fixed.  But I will still use trip advisor website!  On a weekly and sometimes daily basis!

I hope this can be changed.  One reason I LOVE my iPad is my ability to spread, widen, change my view of a page!
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 4
I have had the app for months, but only just started using it this trip. It has come in quite handy and seems to work well.
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
Love it
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 4
This is really helpful when you're trying to find new places to go/eat/see/do in areas that you've already been to and completely new places
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 4
I like it!
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
One of the best applications .
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 4
But how do you forward information to your friends?
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
Fantastic usability

Yeah they really nailed this one on the head.

Pretty sweet in a informative and intuitive app if you ask me
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
Great app. I used it both on my iPhone and iPad !
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
If you are familiar with the website, this is a great implementation of it. Very useful while traveling.
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
I've only been using it about an hour but I like it better than the site. The speed is great and it's much easier to browse hotels than on the website. Great job!
Version 5.7 2011-08-25 5
I never book a hotel without looking it up on trip advisor. And the app is clean and super user friendly. I wish there were more options like searching for nightlife in travel destinations. Otherwise awesome app!
Version 5.8 2011-08-25 5
Useful!

Easy way to find a good place to eat, something to do near by.

Users even update erroneous information.  Use it WHILE I am on the road.
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 5
I'm in Scotland from the states and Travel Advisor has more reviews of restaurants than any other app.  Excellent.
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 4
Useful in researching destinations that I haven't visited before. It will get even better as more users leave reviews and ratings.
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 4
This app has been a great addition to my travel planning toolset! I've had a few learning curve issues, and kind of wish that it was easier to sort/filter search results. But, to get around that issue I've really just changed the way I use the app. Now it's my go-to when I want information on a SPECIFIC hotel vs. when I want to browse hotels in a city... Although I still like the TripAdvisor website for 'browsing'. :). Anyway, my favorite feature of the app is the ability to quickly browse actual photos of a property posted by people who have recently been there. It's much faster/easier to do this on my phone vs. the website.  Either way,  I look forward to contributing to the TripAdvisor content after my next hotel stay!
Version 5.8 2011-08-24 5
It's the only iPod app I recommend for all travelers.  I wish I would have found it sooner.

Version 5.7 2011-08-22 5
We always use this app while traveling (iPhone too.) nothing beats honest reviews from fellow travelers. 1 tip, read through some of the negative reviews before you write something off, sometime people give a bad grade for no good reason.
Version 5.8 2011-08-22 5
period.
Version 5.8 2011-08-22 5

I love this app and TripAdvisor in general!  Never failed me or my family so far whenever we go for our vacations or weekend getaway!  Easy to use especially in the iPad, posted photos are bigger and more easy to navigate.  Thumbs up!
Version 5.8 2011-08-22 5
The Trip Advisor app is very useful. The multiplicity of comments and reviews along with map locations make it easy to determine a hotels location and proximity to other points of interest.
I find it most helpful particularly if you use a good city map in conjunction with the Trip Advisor map. Thank you Trip Advisor
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Very intuitive, search that actually finds stuff, very convenient. 
I have been trying some different travel apps and I find this one one of my favorites.

Vey useful app. Now I mostly use this app for trip wif my bf n his families. We've use this app for information from as close as to San Francisco to as far as Canada, vancouver!
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Makes perfect use of the iPad.  Highly recommend.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
I actually use this one instead of ignore it on my "travel" window.  It's
Helpful to find reviews on places I'm interested in.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 4
I never go anywhere without checking this site for hotel, restaurant and things-to-do suggestions. Indispensable
Version 5.7 2011-08-21 5
I never go out of town without consulting with TripAdvisor. App is has great features especially the trip lists of other users.

So fast & easy to use!  Loving this app!
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 4
I like the way it picks up current and shows all things nearby.

After clicking on a point of interest, it shows the reviews and more info and pictures of it. I like that.

But what I miss is it's location on the map.
For initial result it shows them mon map, but if I go to next page, I cannt see the results on the map.
So only 4 stars
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Easy to book, lots of useful reviews.

Thanks

Like this app it works no hangs or crashes. It could at time be easier to find your way around but it's not a big issue. It did struggle to search near a location as it kept seating near my current location not the one where I had wanted to review.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Really useful app.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 3
Basic and clear, but search functionality by other features such as keywords is lacking...
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
I use this every time I travel. Very easy to navigate. And the price is right (free).  Get it!
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 5
Sometimes the iPad app doesn't provide anything you couldn't get from the web site, but this one does strip away the unnecessary stuff and is also easy to navigate. Information blocks expand when you want to see the contents, for example the reviews. It's very quick, and it's easy to move the map around and refresh it.
Version 5.8 2011-08-21 4
Interface is much simpler than browser. With saved settings making a reservation is quick and easy.

App would be great if it didn't crash as often. Can look for restaurants and hotels near you, so that's kind of neat. Does an automatic review translation which can sometimes be amusing instead of useful, because it doesn't get it right every time, but it's easy to switch off that feature. Hope the update will fix the crashing.

I downloaded this app and within five minutes was able to successfully plan a dinner in a new town.  Good stuff.  The "near me" search was choice.
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
I use it all the time on personal and business travel. Find out what others are saying about things in the area instead of just guessing or trying and being disappointed.
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
Great
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
I like this app,it's really helpful.When I need to look up a place anywhere in the world,I get most truthful and reliable reviews and information about places.Only one time I disregarded reviews about some hotel in Paris,and when I got to that hotel,I was like:I should've listened to those review from trip advisor members.This app is def must have,especially if you like traveling.
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
Easy, easy, easy

Love trip advisor, love the app. The around me map feature works great!
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 4
I wish there wasn't a 48 hr delay when you submit reviews until they are posted because that would have saved me from eating at a terrible restaurant. I also think there needs to be better ways of filtering restaurant types because the selectivity of pricing doesn't always work. Other than that it is a very useful app to provide selection of restaurants, hotels, and attractions.
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
Great tool for traveling

Accurate info, many listings, helpful info when deciding where to stay on a road trip. Definitely a must have for me.
Version 5.6 2011-08-18 5
I use this app extensively; perhaps more than any other. I travel a lot but I'm not a road warrior so heavy travelers will love it all the more. There is some magic going on and I'm too old to believe in magic. I send a confirmation email to Tripit and almost instantly it is returned as a full itinerary and trackable going forward. I give it 5 stars and I'm not one to give praise lightly. Worth every penny.
Version 5.8 2011-08-18 5
This is one of the best apps ever!  It is so user friendly and breaks everything down into categories so that whatever info you're looking for is easier than ever to find.  Love it!

Version 5.8 2011-08-15 5
This has been a huge help to me in evaluating hotels. Some reviewers are completely full of it, and this app has tons of photos so you can judge for yourself.
Version 5.8 2011-08-15 5
I downloaded the app for a trip out of town and the reviews were awesome! It helped me choose things to do and places to eat based off of the location.
I have also used it in my home town and actually found some really cool restaurants that I didn't know existed! 
It was worth the download!!!!

Fun and informative. Hawaii was more fun using this app.

I'm in Denver right now for the weekend and don't make a move without consulting TripAdvisor. Yesterday we had two fantastic meals thanks to TripAdvisor. We were at Larimer Square, used the TripAdvisor app, and voila found great places to eat.

The best part about the app is the street view. It's important for me to see the area around a hotel. I used it when choosing a hotel in Times Square and I was not disappointed.
Version 5.8 2011-08-12 4
This app has been really helpful on my current trip. Searching for restaurants and things to do has been really easy. Thanks!
Version 5.8 2011-08-12 5

Version 5.7 2011-08-12 5
Took us from Scotland to Italy to San Antonio TX.  Our son was giving locals advice on where to eat and what to see IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES!!!!!!  Trip Advisor was just great.  got us their and back anywhere,anytime,anyway.  People were curious, so it was it,s own conversation starter.   Traveling with Trip Advisor is just a hoot!  You,re going to love this product.  Even a low tech Grammy can use it.  And I know that how?  I R 1.
Version 5.5 2011-08-12 5
I have always loved Trip Advisor and this app delivers. I just wish I could see the hotel's star rating without clicking on it first, otherwise perfect.
Version 5.7 2011-08-12 5
I love this app...it brings you the power of tripadvisor on the go, and it is great for times when you are somewhere new, and just want to find something to do.
Version 5.7 2011-08-12 5
Great app. Very helpful during trip to California. Informative and accurate.
Version 5.8 2011-08-12 5
Very happy that I can use on my iPhone in a simpler way. I rely on Trip Advisor to get an idea of places that I'm getting ready to visit. Been using it for a VERY long time and have not been disappointed yet. And now even better I can use it on the go. Thank You!  ;)
Version 5.7 2011-08-12 5

Version 5.5 2011-08-11 5
Love it. Works just like the site!
Version 5.8 2011-08-11 4
When creating reviews, the App needs a lot of work.  The editor window had no facilitites for scrolling up/down to make changes.  Also, the on-line entry provides other capabilities such as preview and requiring information such as last-time-visited.

For finding places it works great.  I will limit my use to that until updates come along that improve the creation of reviews.
Version 5.6 2011-08-11 5
This application is outstanding.  Hotel,restaurant and other important information for each stop on a road trip.  My wife and I find this tool invaluable as we plan our road trips around the country.

Version 5.8 2011-08-11 4
An extension of the website. I find it to be very useful, especially traveling in a city I'm not familiar with.
Version 5.8 2011-08-11 5
This app is very easy to search for hotels and narrow down what you are looking for. We were able to search for only hotels in the French quarter and loved being able to see personal photos and review of the hotels. Can't wait to plan our next trip.
Version 5.8 2011-08-11 5

Any time my husband I go on a trip or vacation, we always research hotels on tripadvisor.com. I do use it to check out the cities I visit as well. The app has been very helpful for looking up places while traveling or even helping with my pre-trip research. it definitely guides where my husband and I will stay.
Version 5.1 2011-08-08 4
Great way to vent, recommend, and find someplace to eat or stay. Don't expect it to solve everything for you and it is great as a tool.

When traveling I always use this site.
Version 5.7 2011-08-08 5
Used this ap to help find our latest hotel... Love it as much as we love Trip Advisor!
Version 5.7 2011-08-08 5
This app gets good reviews in your hands quickly. Many reviews are useful and there aren't any I've seen that are all caps or completely abbreviated spelling.
Use it as write your own reviews to help others out!
The maps work great and it is a stable app - no crashing.

Always find the best prices, very helpful reviews! 

Only thing I'd like to see added is a search by distance tab!
Version 5.7 2011-08-07 5
A critical app for local and international travel!!
Version 5.5 2011-08-07 4
Tripadvisor is my main source for trip planning, and this app works great with one exception: there is no way to really organize the information for comprehensive planning. There is a "save" option so you can save some things but not all.  

When I'm planning a trip I like to organize everything in Evernote. I save websites, trip reports and reviews from Tripadvisor, restaurant menus, and then I have everything in one place.  Some people probably do this in Dropbox too. 

With the addition of Evernote and Dropbox integration this will be a really great app.
Version 5.6 2011-08-07 5
Traveling made easy. Now that's a big deal.
Version 5.7 2011-08-07 5

Helps guide you to the right place!!
Version 5.2 2011-08-07 3
Helpful tool, and i use it all the time when traveling, but...1) Not as useful as the website when it comes to looking at reviews.  The page set-up forces the map too occupy 2/3 of the screen and you must click each review to read more than the first few words.  The website interface for reading reviews is more usefully arranged.  2) the interface for adding captions to photos is TERRIBLE if you want to put in more than a word or two.  

Best things?  The "near me" search and the option to see satellite  and "on the street" views of the places.
Version 5.7 2011-08-07 4
The Title sums it up. Touch interface on the actual maps.  Lots of supporting information. Would be great if it had an integrated interactive Question and Answer option. Something that would let me ask random travel related questions, and in the background search Google, facebook, twitter, the "blogosphere", etc.  Then, collect and arrange the results by source, but still allow me to rearrange them at will.

If I were forced to choose 1 or 2 apps for my iPhone TA would be one of my choices.  As I write I am looking for a place to eat in Baltimore and I get all the info I need in one place.  I've been a TA fan for many years and have never been steered wrong.

I use Trip Advisor alot. This App is not quite as quick to navigate as the main site but I guess you can only fit so much on a smartphone screen. Definitely worthwhile however.
Version 5.7 2011-08-05 5
There is more to this than yelp. There seems to be more reviews and I like the percentage number scoring.  Sometimes the app seems a little slow and fails were Yelp works. Maybe another update will improve speed.
Version 5.7 2011-08-05 5
Love that you can see restaurants and things to do in the area(s) with ratings and comments. Trip Advisor

I am using it on an iPad while on vacation in Colorado Springs. The wifi access is variable so it cannot always determine my location automatically. Every time I open this app I have to type in Colorado Springs over and over again. If it would just pop up the last location searched (like the Weather Channel app) it would be less aggravating. I am now Apple-lazy and want this thing to do the work for me.  If only we chose a short location like Miami or Boise ...
Version 5.7 2011-08-05 4
Great app.... Wonderful for planning a trip to new places. The Forum rocks.
Version 5.7 2011-08-05 5

I enjoy scoping out hotels we are considering, and compare them to a lower and higher resort (like at WDW). You do need to put reviews into perspective though.
Version 5.7 2011-08-04 5

Super Application! Easy to use.
Version 5.7 2011-08-03 5
I have to admit, at first I couldn't see where this app could offer any more than several other available apps.  The beauty of this app is how well it delivers what you're looking for.  It eclipses most airline and travel apps.  It's strength is in it's simplicity.
Version 5.7 2011-08-03 4
Good interface.  Excellent information.  Very easy to use with current location.

Great little app, very useful in finding hotels around your destination. It may be a little buggy and the UI could use a more fluent and faster one, overall geat app!
Version 5.7 2011-08-03 5
Downloaded the app half way through our I10 road trip. Wish I had done it from the beginning!  Found some great places to eat and it helped with the " where to stay" question each night. Thank you SO much!

I was apprehensive when reading reviews. I find Trip Advisor to be honest and trustworthy. On my recent trip to Europe, I relied on Trip Advisor recommendations for my hotels. I found them to be 95% accurate.

Love it, love it, love it.  Hubby researches on laptop while I use this app.  Super app!  Used Trip Advisor to plan tour of Venice.  So helpful.  We loved the Molino Stuckey Hilton in Venice and all the info on TA was priceless.
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 4
We used this app to find restaurants near us on our last vacation.  It worked perfectly and really helped us narrow down our dining choices and in one case find a good Mexican restaurant we would otherwise have missed completely.  Is it perfect?  No.  I'd love to be able to sort my Saves into folders by location so I have them handy.  But it's a good little free app.  :)
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5
One of the best travel app. could find 90% of information I need.
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5
Did someone actually complain that the website has more functionality?  SHOCKING!!!  Of course it does. This is an app on a smartphone and a darn great one. Anyone who complained about this app is ridiculous.  "that airplane can fly--my car is so limiting!!!".

I love everything about this app. You can narrow down your searches, read reviews and view pics from people who have traveled before you. If you use this app to book a trip, make sure to add reviews and pics to help others like you!

Trip Advisor rocks!
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 4
he encontrado mas de lo que pensaba que tenia.
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 3
This app would be great if it let you log in to your account and, most importantly, saved your recent searches. It is SO frustrating when I do an extensive search and then come back a half hour later and it defaults to my current location and I lose everything!! I really appreciate that they have gone to the trouble of creating an ipad app but I will be using the regular site until that issue is addressed.
Version 5.7 2011-08-02 5

This is a handy app that helps take the guesswork out of travel plans.  Would highly recommend!
Version 5.7 2011-08-01 3
Nice to have quick access to reviews. However, I miss not seeing my earlier trips that I've saved and the map takes up too much real estate. Could be my newness to the app so I'll change my rating if I learn differently.
Version 5.7 2011-08-01 5
Awesome.
Version 5.7 2011-08-01 5
Great for ideas & ref's on what to do in destinations, but the best thing is others people's input on these. Nothing like the word of experience!

Version 5.7 2011-07-31 5
We never travel anywhere without checking trip advisor!  So far it's the most accurate hotel rating out there!!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 3
This app has a lot of nice features, but still frustrates the hell out of me! Please take cues from app "hotels"!!!

- why display all points on a map with basic uninformative "pins"???
+ replace the useless green pins with some color coded boxes : avg or current price inside the box, plus color for reviews! no need to on each pin to find out if it's worth checking out!

-  Please display availability if at all possible! 

- when you select an hotel, please allow for full screen map, and display a popup with all information, instead of switching to different view. No need to click "back" all the time!
+ on average, when I'm looking for an hotel, I will check 10-30 hotels. This is tedious, so it would be nice to save a few "clicks / taps" when possible...
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 5
I love this app. It's great to use while traveling.
Version 5.6 2011-07-31 5
Without a doubt the best travel app out there. Has yet to steer me wrong.
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 5
We are frequent travelers and use this app to find fun things to do. I no longer research "things to do" before I leave. I simply use Trip Advisor once I arrive.
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 3
Not bad not great. A little clunky and 1/2 screen map view not very helpful.
Version 5.7 2011-07-31 4
I haven't used it to book a reservation yet but doing research. This app has been very helpful :)

This app is perfect. I used it when my family drove a 3600 mike round trip. I'm only sorry I didn't come across it until we were on our way home!
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5
I am glad I downloaded this app.  I love to read other people's opinions about restaurants before I go to them.  Usually, pretty accurate.  You have to keep in mind that not everyone has the same taste, but I have avoided some pitfalls with TripAdvisor's help.  Will use often.
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5
My number one travel app, I love the reviews from real, honest people. It really helps me when planning my travels, especially abroad. I also like to contribute my own experiences. Must have app!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 4
Getting regular people's opinions is always the best and you make it easy. You are missing a star because if I want to look at the 1,953 photos of the resort I always have to start at the beginning. Can you make some sort of jump button where you skip 50 at a time?
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 5

Great app, great content.
Version 5.7 2011-07-28 4
This is a must have app for vacationers. The large community of users who provide ideas, ratings, and feeedback make this really special. My only advice, would be categories for things to do, outdoor, nightlife, tours, etc. I was trying to find a snorkeling beach in St.Pete. But ended up on the internet after a while. And maybe sorting by cost because we didn't want a snorkeling tour just a snorkeling beach we could head to. regardless, very close to 5 stars perfect.

Not a bad interface and the options are pretty good. Would love for this app (and others) to get clearer signals for "how far in which direction" - whether driving or walking it is little helpful in an unfamiliar area to just get "distance" info. Good crosscheck on Yelp's database and vice-versa.

It's a good app but MADE us write a review. Boooo....
Version 5.7 2011-07-22 5
This app is exactly what I wanted! I wanted a place to keep track of awesome restaurants I see on TV shows and I can with this app. The only thing I wish it could do is let you add notes to your saved places.

I never written a review for any app before, period. But this app is so incredibly informative and easy to use that I was inspired to sing it's praises. Instantly find listings and reviews for hundreds of local hotels, restaurants and "things to do". Make your own decisions based on the wealth of info. Rummage through the BS reviews (you'll see what I mean) and discover some real local finds, no matter your location. 

Read the poorly written and/or snobby reviews in funny voices to your kids for some unexpected fun. This app is a blast!
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5

Trip Advisor works great and takes u to exactly where you want. No links to everything else that YOU ARE NOT LOOKING for. Works very well and is fast.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
Wouldn't travel without it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 5
Our all time favorite on the island! We have been staying here for over 10 years and we stay a least twice per year. We stay in the cabanas only. It is old, but beautiful ocean views, easy beach access!  Love hanging out at the beach/pool bar eating the perfectly grilled poolside burgers... They are simply delicious!  Just relax, kick back and enjoy!  Fabulous!

This app is easy to use and has helped me find nice hotels.
Version 5.7 2011-07-21 4
Good app. Used it a lot, especially for meals.  The save tab was really helpful people would recommend something to us and I would save it for the day. The downside was there was not a place for some of the physical attractions like hiking and stuff. That was a big part of the trip and would like to have been able to save those.  Overall very helpful.

One of the best apps for road warriors!

My husband thinks I like technology too much, but even he was impressed with the usefulness of TripAdvisor on our motorcycle journey through Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.  It was helpful in getting advanced reservations and determining the best options for dining.

Wouldn't take a trip without checking in with Tripadvisor.

A must for any traveler who eats on a regular basis

For a free App you get a whole lot of info. plus an easy to navigate set-up. Try it....you will like it.

Good app for a good resource
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
Works great. You can save things that would like to do on your trip including restaurants and then look at them on a map. Wish they would make the pins for restaurants a different color so they would stand out from attractions. But still awesome!
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
We travel often and this app has been a great help to us. Thanks to it we have found some excellent hotels and restaurants that we may otherwise have overlooked.

The reviews are filled with haters and I love it
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 4
Just loaded this app and so far it's great.  I'm not real crazy about sometimes having to choose different travel companies, ie. Priceline, Travelocity, Hotels.com, etc. to get my rates, if I wanted to use these, I would go to their sights.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.  Other than that it is very simple to use.
Version 5.7 2011-07-19 5
Incredibly helpful in a pinch!

Version 5.7 2011-07-18 5
I'm used to making set of browser bookmarks when we go on trips.  Trip advisor does a lot of the work for you.  It compiles information on attractions based on interests.  I found it very useful for planning site visits by distance and location.

Excellent app. Would be nice to have the option of an off line version. Also, would like to have better, more complete descriptions of the places to visit, rather than having to rely on reading the review.  But overall, one of the best travel apps I've found.

Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
A top-notch tool for travel planning - never leave home without it.  We also use it in our home town.  With so many options in restaurants, lodging and activities and so little time, what could be better than getting advice from people who have actually experienced a place?  Word of mouth proves to be the most reliable way to evaluate a location.  TripAdvisor feedback comes from generally experienced travelers who are willing to share their advice with others.  The information is reliable, updated, informative and valuable.

This app now provides links to phone numbers, emails and websites.  Count on TripAdvisor and get involved.  You will love it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
From booking flights to finding places to eat, this app does it!

Version 5.7 2011-07-17 1
Great app for reviewing and researching. However, the first time I  used it to actually book a flight, my attitude changed. Got the flight info, put in personal and payment info and got to the final stage. When it asked me if I want to become a Trip Advisor member and I went to review privacy policy and terms/conditions it took me to a new screen with no way to go back to my previous page. I had to start over, and I hate to waste time. Something so basic and the developers/testers didn't catch this. Makes me wonder what other details they missed. Very disappointed.
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
It has everything, stay eat see,
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
My husband and I travel quite a bit and we don't do anything without checking trip advisor first.  From hotels to restaurants, this app is our go to for everything.

Simply amazingly useful when planning a trip
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 4
Great app, sows all hotels, restaurants, activities and provides you with tons of CONFLICTING information in the " reviews" section. The same hotel or restaurant can be the best ever or totally disgusting, have great service or the spawn of Satan! Apps like open table or frommers  or zagats will give you a professional rating in addition to all the freaks with wildly different expectations so that you can make informed decisions. Travel Advisor's rating system is the saving grace. Otherwise you're at the mercy of anyone who thinks themselves worldly or knowledgeable-in the end leaving you without a clue of where to stay or eat!
Version 5.7 2011-07-17 5
Downloaded this right before vacation and used it everyday to find hotels and restaurants.  I impressed the rest of the family with how quickly I got information on where we were going.  Great app.

It may be trying too many things, and one never really knows how someplace is based on ratings. For me it's all about the food, while others harp on service or atmosphere. But, the app does what it says it does.

Trying this app for the first time in Kiev, the locations identified are good, but the mapping interface does not work well.  Current location is found, but many top rated sites won't come up on the map, so there is no way to get directions, determine relative distance from current location, etc.  All that being said, this app is definitely a valuable tool that will get even better w time.
Version 5.7 2011-07-16 5
Works fine, no issues so far

Late last night while returning from a trip from Yellowstone to our home in CA, our van broke down outside Salt Lake City, Utah in the middle of nowhere.  Luckily, we had signal
And were able to use Trip Advisor to find the nearest town, a towing company, and a hotel.  It knew where we were even when we didn't- What a relief!
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5

Personally, I LOVE the tripadvisor website so was excited for the app but I think it's missing a couple key components to make it great. First, you can't see things you've done on the website & secondly, I wish you could also save or bookmark forum discussions in case you quickly want to go back & find something you read.
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
I use it anywhere in the world!

I hate searching for places to go in the web, there are too many info to read,but with this app,every vacation planning is made easy. I highly recommend this app for avid travellers and for those who are not,because you will be converted...
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5

Reviews seem to be very accurate
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 4
This app makes it smart and simple.
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
User-friendly, great access to reviews, partner booking sites within app (with option to open in safari) and easy way to save your favorite hotels. Excellent iPad integration
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 1
The app works fine but I find the reviews to be suspect. I travel all over and live in a few places and my opinion is that Trip Advisor reviews are filled with fraud. Otherwise, true dumps wouldn't be as highly rated as they are. Also, great and successful places tend to come in low. I believe competitors use the site as a weapon and post fraudulent reviews rather than improve their own business standards. Which means that it's recommendations (and therefore the app) are worthless. I complained to them about this but they seem content to publish the garbage they do and treat complaints about fraud as a personal insult.

Love it so far
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
A must have for travelers!!
Version 5.7 2011-07-13 5
Best app by far.  I planned a family vacation all through Trip Advisor and I am now working on a second vacation for the month of August. The best part is, The Things to Do  tab, it allows you to see all the things within the vicinity which you would like with cost...it saves a ton of time and allows you to plan in advance. There is just so much to say that is beneficial, love the fact that you can filter just to what you need!
Version 5.6 2011-07-13 5
I travel a lot and I'm constantly using this app. I love it

Easy to use. A great tool to help you plan your next vacation. We never stay anywhere without checking Trip Advisor first.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
Overall this app is great. This was great for locating hotels, restaurants, and activities. I did not use it to book my hotel since it was slightly confusing but I did find one for a good price in a good area. Planning activities was a breeze even on a budget. I would definitely suggest it to anyone planning a trip in an unknown area.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Just got my iPad for some business trips and it is invaluable for local info!

Whether you are planning a day trip or a two week vacation this app is a must have. It has helped me create two great vacations for my family.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
Excellent ap!  Love the searching by price or ratings feature, all the reviews, and the "saves". Only improvements I'd suggest are keeping the prices as updated as possible, showing them whenever possible, showing on the map, and having more links to sites where bookings can be made.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Very good app
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Great!
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Great info in the forums.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
Like owning a lonely planet guide for the world. It's usually spot on with reviews of major attractions, though you won't find many hidden gems here. Would also like to see some improvements to the sorting filters so we can drill down by type more easily...descriptions of attractions don't always match up with filters.  Beyond that, get this app.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Well done
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
The only thing that could make this app better is to have more reviews for a more complete database
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Great app. My favorite app hands down!
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Great app for travel.  Really helpful in narrowing down choices especially while you are traveling.  Great to use in the car.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 5
Just starting to use the app. It's fast, contains lots of info , and easy to use.
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
Trip advisor is great but the reason people look at it is for the reviews. 
They shrink the review to the corner and have the location take up most of the screen. 
Hopefully this will be fixed
Version 5.7 2011-07-11 4
The presentation of info is easy and quick to use.  I especially like the ease of navigating within a map.

I love the site and enjoy the app when it works, but I just got back from Belize and Guatemala where it WA useless even on wifi. Adding insult to injury, whenever I went to the site though Safari it kept trying to redirect me to the app store.

I'm always trying to find things to do in area close by and this allows me to learn so much about different areas! Some of the attractions I couldn't even find on the Internet when searching an area. Very very helpful!
Version 5.7 2011-07-10 1
I love the "real" trip advisor, and use it frequently, but this mobile version just plain stinks!  It is poorly designed, has horrible search options, and takes forever to get any useful information.  I got it, and deleted it within one hour.

Big Thumbs Down !

We found this app to be very helpful and user friendly. We decided to take our time going back home through 4 states. Since we hadn't mapped anything out, the Trip Advisor proved to be very useful. We mapped out 4 stops, paid for two on-line, read helpful reviews, and obtained step by step driving directions.

The trip advisor is a great informal app. I had one issue however: you have you sign up to write a review. I already have an itunes account so this review was easily accessable to me.

This app's purty slick. Dag on bunch of restaurants and stuff. Hoo!
Version 5.7 2011-07-06 5
Takes all the guesswork out of planning a trip.  Haven't used a travel agent once since I downloaded this app.
Version 5.7 2011-07-05 5
We travel a lot and this app makes it easier.  Sometimes you have to wade through some cranky reviews, but that's true on any site.  The map in addition to the star rating makes finding the best places closest to you a breeze.  I still compare other sites, but this is always my go to app.  It works great on both my phone and my iPad.

Wow!  What a fantastic App!  Traveled to the Cape and needed restaurant recommendations and the information I needed was right there!
Version 5.7 2011-07-05 4
I love this app. The functionality and availability of resources is equivalent to the full trip advisor site but in a more streamlined format. One complaint about this app is that the view more button is located very close to and right above the home button, which I have accidentally hit several times. An improvement to this could be to cause the next page to automatically load as you scroll down through the reviews/ forum posts. Overall, wonderful, helpful, and very useful!
Version 5.7 2011-07-05 5
This is a great tool to have. We can always check where to stay or Where to eat minimizing the bad experience opportunities. I love it!'

So far Trip Advisor has been my one stop shop for researching locations, hotels, etc. I am really enjoying reading the reviews and have found the contributors pretty accurate!

Version 5.7 2011-07-04 4
Love this site.  We refer to it for all of our travel. Only improvement I can see at the moment is that when a location is identified by the user, the associated map should have an icon identifying that location. I have had to back track to a paper map or google to find the town.
Version 5.7 2011-07-04 5

Very easy to use. Makes a big city much less overwhelming.
Version 5.7 2011-07-03 5
Found the app very useful due to the plethora of reviews posted for each attraction.
Version 5.7 2011-07-03 3
Need to add that to your site I had no idea that you had those type of reviews!!! Add that and my star rating will go up!
Version 5.7 2011-07-03 5
Highly recommended.

Wish it included events info too :)
Version 5.7 2011-07-03 4
After reading all the reviews, we had mixed feelings about trying this place. I'm glad we went over & gave it a try! We left early to try & get a seat-at 6:40 we were the only ones there waiting. Waitress was nice & took care of our needs. It did take 30 minutes to get our food, but it was cooked to order. It did seem as though the regulars got preferential treatment. I had the burrito & and the hubs had the Slim Stack. The burrito was ok but not great-maybe it was my choice of fillings. The Short Stack Pancakes were fantastic! At over an inch a piece, they were more than enough yummy goodness for us both! We'll try it again for sure!!!

We use this application before planning any trip to create an agenda. Once we're at the destination we use the app to find places to eat.

App crashed or stalls sometimes. Other than that, not bad.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
TripAdvisor is a wonderful page.  It offers great mostly unbiased advice.  The reviews are truly helpful and the amount of data from everywhere makes it really valuable

Well, the APp is all of this and maybe even more, given the great ipad interface.

I really recommend it
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
I'm always amazed how many good user reviews are available, even when you're just about in the middle of nowhere. The app is simple and fast... just as it should be when you're trying to find a place to call home on the road.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
This is a must for travelers in the US.

Easy to use and always right!
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
Leave your guidebook at home! The information is up to date & almost always very reliable. Use the phone numbers to verify hours & focus on the reviews that are most recent. Unfortunately in this economy things can change quickly so check back & take the time to offer your 2 cents.

It's great but the search needs to be more aware
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 4
It's great! If you have nothing to do, don't know where to go do, it'll give you top things to do.
Version 5.6 2011-07-02 5
Being a true fan of TripAdvisor, I immediately installed it's app onto my iPad as soon as I got it.  The speed in which it works is incredible. We will definitely be using it during our trip to Santa Fe later this year so we can check out any of the great places to eat that we haven't tried yet...if there are any!

Whether on your laptop or iPhone/iPad, TripAdvisor is the best traveling companion...with the exception of my wonderful wife.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5

The Trip Advisor app interface is well designed and a must have if you take "stumble upon" vacations or simply are looking for the best place to stay, eat, or see.

Version 5.7 2011-07-02 4
Works great and looks terrific on my iPad. Would have given 5 stars if there was some way to minimize the map. Maybe I just haven't figured it out yet, but it annoys me that I can't get rid of the map when I'm just trying to read reviews.
Version 5.7 2011-07-02 5
An app that does a
Exactly what it is suppose to do. It has been life saver for my recent travels in India.

And for checking out things that look good, but might not be all they appear to be.
Version 5.6 2011-07-01 4
This AP is what I expected from Tripadvisor. I have used their website for years and the AP is almost as user friendly as the site. Unlike the website, on the AP you must go back several steps to get to a different hotel or venue. I will still use it though! My husband and I were able to quickly access hotel information. We were on a impromptu trip and had no plans. The Tripadvisor AP allowed us to find a nice places for good prices as we traveled down back roads and major roads. Thanks!
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Seamless integration with e-mail and safari! Brings all of the great insight and info from trip advisor to your phone!

Version 5.4 2011-07-01 5
I won't book a hotel without it.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 4
Perfect fir what I need. Let's me view everything that I can on the main site, with better navigation. I am planning a trip to Germany in November, and this has proved invaluable for finding advice on hotels, train tickets, bus tickets and information about anything Europe (should I decide to travel outside Germany!) Good job.
Version 5.6 2011-07-01 5
I used this app on a road trip from NY to CA. It was very useful!
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
This is a very helpful app.  Get it!
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Have used trip advisor for years as a website which normally you can find te truth rather than marketing. This app is just as functional, a well written app.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
I love Trip Advisor on the Web and this app makes it easy to use on the iPhone.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
The tripadvisor app is a well thought out app. It's easy to use and has a pretty thorough list of hotels and restaurants with the corresponding reviews from people. Well done
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
You have to have this on any travel adventure!  Like asking the locals what is worthwhile, but even better because you get a summary, rating and more.  Love the map feature too.  Pack your suitcase and this app before a trip!
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Great app when im out and need a good place to eat, always works!

Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Whether business or pleasure, I use Trip Advisor to help me determine where to stay, eat, and what to do. My colleagues have been impressed more than once when I've used the mobile app to find a good restaurant near us after a long day. This app is a must have!
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 4
Love it. Great ideas.
Version 5.6 2011-07-01 5
Very intuitive.  Great content.  Could improve trip building.

This is a sweet app. I like getting other people's opinions on restaurants and things to do, but I love even more giving my opinion when I'm somewhere new!
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
So convenient for on the go research.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
This is one of the best apps for iPad. If you like to travel and explore new areas or even your own area this is a must have.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Use trip advisor all the time. Incredible app!
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 4
Almost as good as the website!

It's helpful & I love how I can add to a place to help the review of a place be more accurate. I recommend this app for anyone taking a vacation.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
This app makes traveling so much more fun. It is easy to use and a great support.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 3
I generally like the program, but it has a couple of bugs that randomly "kick you" out of the program.  Also, it would be great if it could list more than 20 restaurants at a time.
Version 5.7 2011-07-01 5
Nice interface and great map integration.

I have used tripadvisor.com for years and love it.  Traveling with 2 adults, 2 kids, we trust and use the reviews to help us choose hotels, food and adventures in places we've never been.  Now, with this app, planning trips and reading and writing reviews is easier than on my computer.
Version 5.7 2011-06-30 5
This app gives u all the info you need
Version 5.7 2011-06-30 5
This app I'd designed for I-pad so it makes a great app even better.. Easiest to read, no need to click and wait for maps to laid.. It's all right there on the same page. Can not travel without this app!!

Version 5.7 2011-06-29 5
Works better than Expedia for Hotels.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 3
5 minutes in to using the app and nav is a bit cludgy...need to use the "back" button to get out of restaurants and search new towns.  Not as easy as I'd like.

Upside is that it's TA...great data, and the mapping is solid.

Can't wait for the first upgrade!
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 4
Easy to use and navigate. Great app.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 4
Good!
Version 5.5 2011-06-28 5
I travel a lot throughout the US and International. I always check out hotels and local restaurants before I go. Last week my wife and I tried out a seafood oyster bar in Panama City that was recommended by trip advisor. We liked it so much we returned a few days later with three other couples. 
Trip advisor gives you the opportunity to compare and make your choices, weather your looking for fancy high priced or a low priced local hangout and every thing in between.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 4
This is great for planning! I just wish it had a way of searching for other types of places nearby like garden centers.
Version 5.6 2011-06-28 5
Amazingly useful app. The seamless combination of a map view with the trip advisor rankings makes this interface far more useful then in a browser. Hard to go back to the web site after using this app.

Another plus on gps equipped units and finding stuff near to you. Just the restaurants fill in the huge gaps left by something like zagat which just covers metro locations. 

Love it.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 5
Great for planning your trip ANYWHERE, because someone has always been there before you.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 4

We love trip advisor.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 4
So far I have just explored trip advisor, using it to see what comes up while in our vacation home. So far I think it's great. Pin points restaurants and information about them nicely. I would recommend this app, especially for those traveling in unfamiliar areas in order to locate restaurants, activities, etc. near their residing place. Gives nice map and directions.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 5
I like this app very clean and easy to use.

App performs well on wifi, and "near me now" makes a decent alternative to the Yelp app when traveling internationally. Map feature mostly accurate, better on wifi than data.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 5
I've used Trip Advisor for the past 5 years for all trips we take and I LOVE it!
I check so many things via TA such as hotels, restaurants, local points of interest and reviews just 
to name a few. You have to take reviews with a grain of salt because sometimes experiences
are just going to be different. Overall we have always found the site easy to navigate and current 
with info.
Version 5.7 2011-06-28 5

Nice to go so quickly to my favorite travel site, but I don't like that there is no history if I want to continue a search I started and want to go back to but it brings me to where I am currently. I will ask for that info if I want it.

Ok
Version 5.7 2011-06-25 3
Using this app on an iPad. Some ideas to make this app better: 
1. When launching, I want the app to remember and land on the last search or thing I was viewing rather than default to my current location. Or it should at least ask me if I want to default to current location or last search. I know I can turn location services off, but still...I should have a choice when launching the app.
2. Ability within app to launch email and email a location or trip list to a friend.  Or some way of sharing your "my saves" with a friend....
3. Within "my saves" I want the ability to organize my favorite destinations in folders and subfolders similar to how I might organize bookmarks in a browser. 
4. Ability to create an itinerary / schedule for each day of my trip and export to my calendar app on my device. 
On the plus side, I did like the ability to link to Orbitz, Expedia or hotels.com to look at packages and then return back to the place I was viewing before.

I have always gone to TripAdvisor for candid reviews, and advise from locals. Now, this app takes it to high gear. I find it very intuitive and the layout gives a lot of info without being too cluttered. Thanks for this excellent travel app. I highly recommend it!

Some restaurants are not shown. Location for restaurants may not be accurate.  Restaurants with few ratings are a toss up.

Great to have all the info on my phone. The search "near me now" is a great feature. The map was a bit off in Glasgow which is why I don't give it 5 stars.
Version 5.6 2011-06-24 5
Tripadvisor is a compass for the modern traveler
Version 3.0 2011-06-24 5
Just enter in your location & choose the hotel you're interested in and then pick a site (priceline, orbitz, etc) and it gives you the best rates! Easy to view everything and especially helpful in a pinch!
Version 5.6 2011-06-24 4
Very useful for attractions in the Florida Keys. For information on sites in Yosemite National Park, it was less than comprehensive.

I have booked with them 3 times bow and they have topped all other flight websites that make you open up 5 other pages whereas as these guys have all offers on one page and easily link you to the dealer of the offer. No hassle. Awesome. :) flying out to see my bf again in Illinois thanks to them.

I love Trip Advisor!  I use it when I'm planning a trip, checking hotels and at a destination looking for a place to eat. I have found "specialty" restaurants will be rated higher than "traditional" restaurants because they have more loyal customers.  But none the less Trip Advisor is a great tool to have in your pocket.
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 5
Very nicely done. Keeps the true functionality of TripAdvisor on an iPad format.
Version 5.6 2011-06-23 4

Need a hotel?  This is where to research and find the best accommodation for any trip.  I looked for weeks forma large quad room in Rome for June 2011.  I looked for nearly 2 months on all sorts of websites but overall selected the one I am staying at this week through here and I could not be more pleased.  Price and location were important but the reviews of guests is what makes the website so powerful.  Thank you All for always letting other travelers know your experiences.

It could be five star but when we search for food nearby it shows a lot of random things like deja vu and the body shop? Over all 3 stars it's good enough but could be better

Always liked TripAdvisor on the web - now on iPad is super. So easy to use -same great traveler reviews. Always feel more confident reading what "real"travelers think.  Plus you can see user photos of hotels to her the 'real' story.  And the street view showed me major conduction going on at the front of a hotel I was considering in San Fran. Dodged a bullet on that one thanks to TripAdvisor :)

Version 5.6 2011-06-19 3
As for telling you about events and where they are it's great. But it lacks any details like when it is, the times places are open, or even general descriptions of the place. Overall not very helpful as I have to look elsewhere for info.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
If you are traveling 10 or 1000 miles from home, you need this app. Found 2 great places to stay, and a wonderful restaurant during our trip so far.
Version 5.6 2011-06-19 5
Now easier to look up restaurants on the run! Always use Trip Advisor before travel.

It provide necessary info.but some time the room you booked could not be guarantee to reserve for 4 star or higher hotel.The price will always change.

Trip advisor is a must have!
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
I used the TA app to help my friend and I plan a summer trip to Montreal.  All of the available reviews, info, and photos were very helpful in finding hostels to stay in, places to eat and drink, and where to go.  Will definitely be using it again to plan my trip to New Orleans!
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
Awesome on ipad2!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
Thee best app to use to finding the right hotel, hands down. The reviews are awesome, detailed and on the mark.  Try it out. You won't be disappointed.
Version 5.6 2011-06-17 5
Love this app,  great feedback from travelers...it's nice to be able to get tips before going from people that were just there....also nice to see actual pics since most of the time you get to a hotel and it doesn't look anything like the pics!

Excellent application. Very helpful for any kind of travelling and aspect of it
Version 5.5 2011-06-16 2
When trying to compare changes to itinerary it defaults back to today's date and one has to remember to keep putting in the proposed future dates over and over again. Also, does not find inexpensive flights compared to orbitz and priceline...
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 4
I love trip advisor.  I use it all the time to find out where things are close to my house.  It is very easy to use and very accurate!

I prefer the trip advisor app to their main site because it is simple to navigate and requires fewer pages to load to get the information I am seeking.
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 5
A need,not a choice. Takes the mystery out of traveling.

5 stars
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 5
It really is, indispensable
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 4
Love this app. Only issue I see is that as you are writing reviews from your mobile device (iPod), you cannot easily scroll back up in the text boxes.  Otherwise very helpful and easy to use!
Version 5.6 2011-06-16 5
I love using this app! Is such an easier way to find locations where I am traveling.

Honest reviews from REAL people.

Version 5.6 2011-06-15 5
I love the simple setup. Works great! Never had any problems!

Enter Northport NY and you get 2 hotels. There are dozens more in adjacent towns with no way to find them. You cannot expand your searchunl

TripAdvisor has been my go-to site for years. Definitely the place to start planning any vacation!
Version 5.6 2011-06-15 5
Lots of ways to sort.  Check out "live view" for a way to have ratings while you walk using your camera and gps to identify where you are.

Awesome.  App
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
As a delta airlines staff in Santiago I must say that have been in many different places in the world. Meet many people who has helped me, guide me to some nice places, etc. If I would I have known before of this app I would have saved more money, been in more places and avoid going to see friends just to not pay for accommodations. :D excellent tool for someone who travels a lot and want to evaluate the place, the room, and the quality for a future journey.
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 4
Very good app.... Has been a lifesaver when traveling
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 2
I don't know where all the 5-star ratings are coming from. The search feature is terrible. It's good only for searches in your immediate area. When I searched an area I'm traveling to, it did not mark my location. I had no point of reference for the area restaurants. It looks great but, unfortunately, hasn't been a benefit to me at all. Good thing I didn't have to buy it!
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
So useful and helpful when finding a restaurant.. I love it!
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5

Just perfect! Amazing! It's a no-brainer: you MUST install this app if you intend to travel!
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 4
I do love trip advisor but why, when you find a listing you like, and you tap "email", why does the email auto load the business name? Where is share?
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
Best app to look for unbiased reviews on hotels.... And so convenient on iPad...thank you

I always check this source.
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5
Trip apps are a mixed bag. This is the only one I continue to favor out of the dozen other travel apps  I have installed. I give it a five because I have never encountered a bug and it has never let me down. I use it at least weekly. And all I can say is that it is far and away the best I have used.
Version 5.6 2011-06-14 5

Awesome app...everything works
Version 5.4 2011-06-12 4
I wish I could filter hotels by availability, though, like the website!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-12 5
I love this app! I learned the hard way that for me the bad reviews should be read first. Take note of how many and if they are all saying the same thing. If there are no red flags in the bad reviews then I hit the good ones! This has greatly increased the chance that I will agree with the previous reviews. I suspect that some good reviews are planted by the businesses themselves. Just my opinion! If you make a bad choice you can look back on the bad reviews and get a good laugh out of the mistake that you made!  It has helped me get over wishing I had done something else! Good luck!
Version 5.0.1 2011-06-12 5

Many of the restaurants they list near me have been closed for a while. One address is correct but listed on the map in the wrong location. If it's wrong near me I certainly can't trust it on the road.

This app is amazing. I especially love the map feature. Great travel app.

Sometimes it's great. Sometimes it won't find restaurants where I know where "Where" says there are tons!
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
I'm not a huge fan of the user interface of tripadvisor.com (although I love the concept), so I was pleasantly surprised to see that the iPad app is so easy to use.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 4
Nice, but...
Since I have an iPod, not the phone, I want to be able to save more information in a smaller, handier space. "My Saves" is a nice feature on TripAdvisor, but instead of saving only individual restaurants, I want to save the whole list of search results all on one page WITH phone numbers. That way, as we're driving through Memphis one night on our way to Texas, we can have one big long list of names and phone numbers and call whoever catches our fancy. Kapiche? The lack of that feature lowers this app from five to four stars.  TripAdvisor always has and remains a great site.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Awesome app!!!!
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Finding things to do on my vacation real quick- saving me a bunch of time

I trust trip advisor so much and am thrilled to have mobile access. It's awesome.

Version 5.6 2011-06-10 1
I travel a LOT. Thought this would help me while on the road.  Too difficult to change the location searched. I deleted the app after the 2nd trip.
Version 5.4 2011-06-10 5
Great app. Provides the same great resource as I get on my laptop with ease of use.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 3
The content from trip advisor is great. The app adds the location based service you'd expect. UI could use a little improvement as the reviews/overview in left pane, map in right doesn't quite make sense.  Also, lots of back clicking if you're digging into reviews.  Again, great content and definitely worth getting if you're traveling.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Gives the cheapest air fairs/good advice on hotels.  This app is all good
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
If one is looking for an app to find a restaurant with reviews in whatever city, town, or area you're in TripAdvisor is the one.
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
Fabulous site! Great for finding restaurants while on vacation. Reviews are from real people,not critics! Love that!
Version 5.6 2011-06-10 5
One of the very best travel sites with reliable and easy to find information. Tripadvisor has saved me a ton of money on quality hotels over the years. App is very well-designed for the iPad. User friendly and intuitive. Good on the iPhone but iPad version a million times better.

Always refer to Trip Advisor before going anywhere. I always check it for local places to see if we agree. We generally do.

Love the app, especially the range of reviewers.  We used Yelp alone, until we happened to be on vacation and found Trip Advisor to have a more diverse range of reviewers.

Don't speak the language, and know nothing about the people... This is it.
I have gone to jungle countries knowing nothing except trip advisor and some wiki and enjoyed myself immensly. Trip Advisor is heady!
Version 5.6 2011-06-06 5
This app should be shown to all other developers as an example of great UI. What a beautifully implemented app. But if it was only beautiful, I would not give it 5 stars. It also WORKS elegantly and does what you'd expect it to do without getting in the way. I recently finished a road trip and this app was always there to guide me with timely information on local hotels and eateries. Big Kudos to TripAdvisor!
Version 5.6 2011-06-06 4

They did a beautiful job bringing this App to iPad. Really great presentation and very intuitive, simple UI! Nicely done.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 4
Not a bad app at all. Use the service from the web for a lot of my European travel and have always like it - though the number of advisors for many of the stops are few so a solid sampling is hard to come by. As for app it is well constructed with a great layout and abundant features. The link to the current location by way of recommended stops is wonderful. Well done.
Version 5.5 2011-06-05 2
The map takes up a large fraction of the screen area, and the text is smudged to one side. If there is a way to change this, I could not easily find it.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5
Very handy. Thanks
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5
Use it for all my creative traveling research

Love this!
Version 5.3 2011-06-05 5
This is a wonderful app, with a serious community of travelers who really take time to explain and make suggestions about sites to visit, places to stay, shop or eat.  For the armchair and aspiring  traveler alike.  My only complaint is that the site is sometimes a pain to navigate.  Presumably they're working on improvements.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5
Must for every traveler.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5
Love this app. Helps for vacation planning and finding things local.
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5
I use this app every day when I travel, and it has never failed me. When traveling, if I use reviews online from other sources, I am often disappointed. I am always thrilled with the recommendations I get from Trip Advisor...for food and hotel. It has saved me more money than it costs!
Version 5.6 2011-06-05 5

Probably the best app because it's written by the tourists themselves

Version 5.6 2011-06-02 5
TripAdvisor.com has become my go-to site when making travel plans. This well-designed app puts the best features within easy reach. I'll still use the full site most often, but when I want to quickly check out a hotel or destination, it's easily available.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 5
I travel very frequently and this app has been great for quick planning. It's fast and accurate. Makes booking complete packages fast and painless.

This is a great app. It is very intuitive and user friendly, with pleasing layout and colors. It is easy to find what you are looking for, whether using normal search or near-me search. 
It then displays relevant info and reviews. No clutter or unnecessary info.  From a content point of view it seems to cover most establishments no matter how remote, with enough reviews to get a balanced view.   A definite must-have app, whether you are traveling and looking for a restaurant or hotel or planning your next trip.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 5
Easy to write my reviews and publish them right in the app!

All u can ask for in an app like this
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 3
I like the app but like the website better.  Maybe I just need to know how to find things on here but it seems like it keeps bringing me back to my home instead of the last place I was researching.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 5
Great reviews that help you choose the best options for you and your family.
Version 5.6 2011-06-02 5

Works great
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 5
Great application!!!

In many ways the app is better than the site, especially searching for food and attractions near a location. A must for international travel!
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 4
I use tripadvisor on the web frequently and the app just makes it that much more convenient. There's room for improvement with regard to searches, filtering and navigation but not so much as to dissuade me from using or recommending the app.
Version 5.5 2011-05-31 5
Very useful tool to research & plan trips.  No wise Traveler should be w/o it.
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 4
So far so good.

Found likes of new places to go eat.
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 4
Good app like their site. Reviews for the people by the people. I'll believe a travelers set of photos of hotels and destinations any day over the eye candy brochureware the hotels themselves provide. Love Tripadvisor.com and it's mobile extensions.
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 5
Love it!  Just needs a few more filters to be perfect.
Version 5.4 2011-05-31 5
Very helpful
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 4
Very good info from fellow travelers. Be sure to read many reviews; its not always easy to know the background of a writer. A single individual may or may not have a lot of experience traveling to form a good comparison to other experiences so best to read multiple. 
Would be Interesting if there were an optional brief survey to fill out as a reviewer- how many trips per year, which countries or cities, languages fluent, etc. Readers would have an idea of the persons background.
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 5
I use TA all the time!!  It's great!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-31 5

Trip Advisor is great for planning a vacation but it's also invaluable when at your destination.  Finding things to do and how to get there couldn't be easier with the map layout and location services. If you like the web site you'll love this app. Can't beat free either.
Version 5.6 2011-05-30 4
This is a great app for quick info on a large variety of destinations. Some of the descriptions need to be expanded.

Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
You open it and it uses your location to instantly display all restaurants and entertainment in your area, with ratings, reviews, and price information, all on map that shows where they are in relation to you. Like having a local with you on your trip.  Stunning and amazing to have such data at your fingertips.

This is a great app for iPad! I'm in Vienna right now. Just took the train from Prague.  Talked to a woman who said this site is like her Bible.  Still figuring out how to use it, but I'm sure I will.

Nice app)
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 4
I like this app very much. A small feature could make it even better - please add a possibility to share my bookmarks with my fellow-travelers, via email or Dropbox or whatever way, for them to get a list of places I bookmarked and see it in their TripAdvisor app. I'd like them to be able to vote/rate my choice so that we could came to a consent which places to visit. It would be a great trip planning feature that could significantly differentiate TripAdvisor! And finally about a bug I found - the "Back" button disappears in the list on the left after you choose to view a street. This is annoying.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
Found very nice restaurants in NY, LA, Sedona or in Europe. Got reviews for nice restaurants in Phoenix and tried them out
Found things to do in Sydney and Europe. 
I don't know all travel apps out there, but this one is reeeally helpful.
There should be a 5+ category for the best of the best and this one would be there!!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
It's a great app, stable, and great at it's meant to do.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
I always check Trip Advisor for insights from fellow travelers. Sure, anyone can have a bad day and write an unfair review but the balance of all reviews paint a helpful picture.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
It's very useful to find anything related to travel.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
I plan every aspect of my trips with trip advisor. Good for local activities to Europe, Hawaii everywhere. The hotel info is always dead on. Now I got it on my iPhone and iPad. So many junk apps but NOT this one.
Version 5.6 2011-05-29 5
This app is a virtual travel agency come tour guide! It was a breeze to view attractions, accomodations and to book all from one place.

:)
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
Nice and quick

Finding a top restaurant in a tourist area full of them can be hard. This app, with it's reviews and ratings, made it a breeze and it was "spot on"!
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
Excellent app. Use it all the time and find very useful. Better than yelp, where or city search. Only issues are that it doesn't have restaurant opening/shut times and it doesn't display menu's.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
The best!
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
I love the Trip Advisor App. My husband and I travel a lot both for business and for fun and I find this App very helpful. I used it for the first time in Hong Kong last February, it gave me great advice on a few excellent restaurants, advice confirmed by the Concierge at the Mandarin Hotel.
I am now relying on Trip Advisor for organizing a trip to Tokyo next September.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 4
Fast and useful
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
I already used TripAdvisor.Com extensively for work and personal travel. This app puts it in my hand with a great GPS-enabled "near me" feature.

I use this in a pinch and always find something fun to do in a new city.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 1
Why bother, this is just their mobile web site, not an iPhone app. Try a hotel search, no images on the list view? Give me a break. This app was definitely released just because they wanted app store presence, the content and user experience are an after-thought.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
Great app.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
This app is extremely easy to use, and has a very helpful layout that shows you the location of whatever you are looking up on the map on the side. Great app to use while traveling!

The user interface is clean and easy to use.  Very easy to read the reviews, which is my favorite part of Tripadvisor.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 4
Tripadvisor is a good resource with honest reviews from folks. This app is super helpful as the search for locations is fast with good autocomplete and easy access to photos of the lodging. A must have app for your vacation planning.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
This is one of the most professional apps I have ever used. I am a journalist and travel very frequently to different parts of the world and this app just gives the very best tips that only a very veteran tour guide would give you (only if you give them a big tip and this app does it all freely for you!)
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
As a Travel Agent, I have come to rely on Trip Advisor.
Version 5.6 2011-05-28 5
I use TripAdvisor several times per week to check out hotels, restaurants, and things to do when I travel for both business and pleasure, and even for local restaurants and activities. I have NEVER been misled and, more often than not, the recommendations exceeded my expectations. I've even been to a few places and participated in activities that I would not have ever considered doing until I read reviews. I'm a huge fan and recommend it frequently to family, friends, and colleagues.
Version 5.5 2011-05-28 5
This is by far the best travel  app available.  I had been a huge fan of their website already, and the app is even better.  It's simple to use, with super fast results, and I save every time on flights, lodging, etc. compared to EVERY other travel site there is.  Forget Hotwire,  Travelocity, Expedia, Kayak....ALL you need is TripAdvisor.  I highly recommend this app, great job!*****

So 2 of my friends decided we were going to go on a trip, so I suggested London. I went to this apps website, and it said you could download the iPhone app free, so I said why not, and got it, in a matter of 10 minutes I had a whole trip planned out, recommended hotels, places to eat and visit, 5 stars!

I'm a TA addict...having it on my phone just gives me more opportunity to use:)

This is a must-have app whether or not you're traveling. My only suggestion:  ALL eating establishments (from dining to fast food) should have prices.
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 4
Pretty informative...got lots of ideas now.
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
I am currently in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on holiday. I checked on Yelp and the app did not have any information about restaurants in this wonderful city. Tripadvisor, on the contrary, was full of restaurants with review, information, etc. Way to go!

This app makes it so easy to check places out before booking. I always check on the Mac but now I can just use the app to check out the places we are considering whether it s for dinner or a stay. TripAdvisor never steers me wrong!
Version 5.5 2011-05-24 4
Trip Advisor itself can't be beat.  The appis a little less functional than the basic web site (which is easy to navigate on an iPad) because it annoyingly inserts the map even when you don't need it.
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 4
A must have app for would be travelers! Gives you the tools you need to have great and safe vacation experience!

Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
Gives you tons of information very quickly. Truly indispensable for a trip.

One minor complaint, though: when searching for a hotel, there should be more filter options (e.g., by star rating). Currently you can filter only by price-and very poorly (searching for a price range would be a nice improvement).
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
Great app!
Version 5.6 2011-05-24 5
I've been a Trip Advisor fan for years  using my desktop. But it's good to have a mobile app as well while traveling or just searching from home.

I would say that I was really happy to see the interface of this app. I travel a lot and most of the time find myself searching for hotels or restaurants on my tiny blackberry screen..,
But this is exactly what I need on y iPad. Something that knows where I am and suggests according to my filters... This really changed the way I look for things around.. Off to a nice restaurant to eat something (which is actually few blocks away) !! Cheers

Poor location based hotel finding. No option to specify number of miles from city center to find hotels. The price range does not match what is returned by links to hotels.com etc. Kayak far more stable.

Very good for road trips and travel!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Used for the first time while vacationing in Williamsburg, VA. Never led us astray. Used for everything from restaurants to entertainment. Loved it!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
Gives good info on local events; convenient and easy to use
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Have been using the computer version for several years. The information is very useful and accurate. The phone app is a great addition!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
I love this app. I use it whenever I take a trip as my trip resource guide. All the reviews have been so helpful and I have never been disappointed. Thank you trip advisor.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
Love it. Real reviews from regular travelers not professionals.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Amazing!!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Great app! We have used this app on the iPhone and iPad to make our summer vacation plans..... Love it!!!!!!
Version 5.5 2011-05-22 4
I love trip advisor but the app doesn't have a way to leave a review.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Awesome
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
I use this app every tine I visit a new city. It has been stop on so far and I am beginning to depend on it.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
I could've used this app before our trip to Singapore & Malaysia!  Easy to use.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
I use this app for planning & while on vacations.  It has become my go to source for information.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
I used this to make a reservation on my iPad but then could find no good way to save my reservation confirmation from within the app. I had to snap two screen shots and piece them back together in Pages to have something to print and email.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
This is the best way to really learn the truth about your destination!  It evens the playing field when it comes to fair business!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
My husband and I recently took a trip & used this app to help us decide what sites to see. The reviews were really helpful
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
So glad there's an app for that now!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
Fast, stable and provides exactly the information you would want in an intuitive format.  Helpful for personal travel, finding a nearby restaurant, or planning activities when family comes in town.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 2
Keeps crashing.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
It just like the website for the iPad.  Though I'm not sure if you can add a restaurant or hotel via this app...
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
Whether looking for flights, food, or lodging, this app does it all
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
This is a great tool.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
So far I love it. Easy to find restaurants and starting to plan a road trip from Vegas. I love the " my saves" ability
Version 5.5 2011-05-22 5
It's great. Love it!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
Be better if you could get directions to a location when looking at the map..
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 5
This is a great tool that comes in very handy both at home planning a trip and on the road looking for a place to stop and rest.
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 3
I downloaded your app hoping to access my travel map...no success!
Version 5.6 2011-05-22 4
Used this app to look up hotels in south padre island and worked very well
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 5
Easy to use, everything about this app
Is awesome
Version 5.6 2011-05-16 5
I never go traveling with out using this app first. This app has helped me find numerous hotels and places to visit.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
Mostly helpful, but sometimes the descriptions are unclear and they don't have updated website links
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
This app is easy to use. The interactive map is going to be very useful when on vacation.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Very helpful.
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 1
This ap is nothing like the web version. When you look at the maps you have split screen and makes viewing large areas difficult. Hard to find attractions for the area you are viewing. Very frustrating ap especially if you are used to using Tripadvisor.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
First thing I hit when on a business trip in a new town.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
Very easy to use, find what you want. One feature to add is "home" and maybe  "history"
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Has been right on the money in finding and rating, mostly hotels and restaurants for me.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
It's great when you're about to book a flight for the lowest fare. It also give you places to go around your area which is real handy
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 4
Just started to use the app and I love it. I use it to confirm what the hotel recommends for dining and it has helped me to avoid touristy places.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
Good stuff, provides great ideas to facilitate free time. May not be perfect but works extremely well.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Loads pretty fast. Easy to navigate. Very similar to the website. Love it!
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
I like the usability of this app.  Excellent all around information and pretty accurate.
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 5
Use it all the time while traveling, never disappointed, has improved quality of traveling tremendously.
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 5
Great for ideas

Super duper
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Can't beat the functions of this application and it is easy to use.  I love it!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 2
Does not seem to allow for locking an address at a destination to search by, would be nice to see what is actually near the destination address instead of "suggested" sites. Hopefully wifi will be available in my "non-suggested" spot.
This is not my idea of a trip planner but it likely will be a help.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Great app! I use this app non-stop when I travel to make the most of every trip. It's my favorite travel app by far. I also use the app locally to try different restaurants. Now that they added save functionality it's perfect!
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
TripAdvisor had always given me great advice. I'm addicted.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
This site is very helpful when planning a trip especially what to visit. I would like to see web sites of attractions added more often.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Time to start planning the next trip?  You don't even have to get off the couch...
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Just started using this apparent and really enjoying it. Great compliment to website.  User friendly!
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Just try it and see!!!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Aside from the standard features of TripAdvisor, the integrated map and great user interface make it a breeze to find things to do when in a new city. As a business traveler with limited time, this app is a must have!
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 4

I like having all the reviews in one place for a destination.  It is so easy and fast.  Perfect for that quick recommend.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Love it , use it
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
I have been using Trip Advisor for for two years now and never been mislead. Now that I have an IPad I am glad there is a T.A. App?
Version 5.4 2011-05-15 5
My first source for anything to do with travel.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 4
Very helpful app especially when going into something nearly blind. One improved feature would be maps in local languages. I tried to tell people the street names of the hotel I found and nearby landmarks, but to no avail because they had no idea what I was saying. Other than that it seems like a great app!
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 5
Always use this site before booking anything. Actual photos from people and their reviews.
Version 5.5 2011-05-15 4
Great application with easy navigation. You'll find everything you need and the reviews are a great help to choose from various options available be it restaurants, clubs, hotel rooms. Very helpful.
Version 5.6 2011-05-15 5
Fantastic. Use it all the time.
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 5
If you are a traveler it is the best
Version 5.3 2011-05-14 4
I've been using it to look up restaurants primarily. Very helpful. Sometimes the map doesn't display all of the places that are on the list, but still this is a great resource!
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 5
Want to find the perfect hotel? How about "the best" restaurant near you? Nothing beats Trip Advisor Mobile!
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 5
Excellent way to find hotels...especially at good rates.  The user reviews are especially helpful.
Version 5.6 2011-05-14 5
This is a must have.  Very good interaction with maps and the search options work very well

Never travel without consulting TripAdvisor. And the Ipad version is superb!
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
Excellent handy app

This saved us in the airport figuring out what to do first when we suddenly decided to make the trip! Thanks!
Version 5.5 2011-05-13 5
Great ap. Easy to use.
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
This is so awesome, it's so easy to look up things to do and see!
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 4
It's a easy fun app
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
Use it mostly to see what others think of hotels prior to booking them. Keep putting in those reviews. Thx!!
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
I like that it keeps me in touch with my neiGhborhood eats
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
The best of yelp with the depth of trip advisor
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
My mom n I r driving from Ohio to Colorado and the trip advisor app has helped us find places to stay and different restaurants to try. The "near me now" feature is awesome!
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 4
Sometimes the map function is a little wonky but overall it works great and proved to be an asset on my last trip!
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
Does what you'd expect
Version 5.6 2011-05-13 5
This makes it easier to dream!

I liked it, useful app
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 5
Very useful app for trip planning.
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 3
Overall great app, but I use Facebook to log in online and with the app there is no way to log in using this method. 

I will change to 5 stars once this change is implemented.
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 5
Love love love it easy to use and fast!
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 3
If you are looking for honest reviews this might not be your app. I am in the process of booking a stay in Bora Bora and most of the reviews talking about booking with Pacific for less. Now I could understand one or two but the more reviews I read the more I see this travel agency come up.
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 1
As soon as you click the "near me" button the app crashes
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 5
Trip adviser is most helpful when planning a trip to either a new location or you simply want to stay at a different hotel in the same city. I always use it when planning a trip for hotels and new places to eat.
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 4
Very cool. Helped me find Young's Bicycle shop on Nantucket
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 4
A generally useful app but some restaurant reviews are clearly self-reviews.
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 5
I have had this app for 3 days.  I have managed to find hotel reservations in 3 cities restaurants on a business trip on the spur of the moment and have done each of these things in seconds!  Thank you for making it so wonderfully easy to see pricing and make reservations around the world.
Version 5.6 2011-05-12 5

Version 5.6 2011-05-12 4
Very helpful and easy to use
Version 5.5 2011-05-12 2
I like the full website rather than the app. Why doesn't it give you any options or suggestions of destinations in the case the someone doesn't know the location they would like to travel to? There's only the option of entering a name of a city or "near me now". Well, if I don't know where i'd like to vacation to and i don't plan on traveling near my home location then this app is useless.
Version 5.5 2011-05-12 5
I like it.
Version 5.5 2011-05-11 5
You must have this application when on vacations.
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 5
Lots of new reviews
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 2
I notice that this App. only gives you high class restaurants and hotels. Not good if your an average person on a budget. For example I would search for restaurants near me and the results are a joke. The only one that shows up are high end restaurants that's a distant away. Don't get me wrong, these are good places to eat but I would only go there on special occasions. A lot of good local restaurants & hotels are not listed. This app. Is good if u have money to spend. I'll stick with Yelp & AroundMe.
Version 5.5 2011-05-11 5
As title, nothing to be complained so far, good app,good advisor
Version 5.5 2011-05-11 5
Love it. Found what I needed in seconds.
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 5
Very helpful pieces of information
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 4
It's a little cumbersome, but better than using their full site on Safari.  When uploading pics during a view, the app quit twice.  A glitch that needs attention.  Overall, useful.
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 2
Slow and cumbersome but gives you a lot of info.
Version 5.6 2011-05-11 5

Version 5.6 2011-05-11 5

Version 5.5 2011-05-10 3
Nice to have when traveling and trying to find places to eat. Would like one more filter to be able to specify that I am looking for a breakfast, lunch, or dinner place. Don't tell me there is a great little place around the corner for food when they primarily just serve or specialize in breakfast.
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 5
We use this app all the time! It's especially helpful for finding out what hidden little gems there are to explore wherever you happen to be. Love it!
Version 5.6 2011-05-10 5
Simply amazing
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 4
I love this app...great for planning trips.  Only thing missing are numbers on the maps...get a list of hotels but no way to tell which hotel goes with which pin...unless you select each one.
Happy tripping!
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 5

What can I say... for those of us who travel, this is a life & trip saver. I don't leave home without it ;-)
Version 5.5 2011-05-10 4
All of the information is compiled neatly, but perhaps an Advanced search feature (I.e. Search by inputs such as Pet-friendly, economy brackets, or stars/ratings)..
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 5
Just like website, gives great feedback so you always know what you're in for!
Version 5.5 2011-05-09 5

The results show stores that are no longer there, wrong addresses, and even when the address is right, it shows up wrong on the map.  I must cut the address from tiro and paste it into some other mapper like maps.google to get the correct map location.

The recommendations are good, but the location part needs work.

Very useful  and great when you have kids

We just used this app for the first time on a trip to Maui. The only word that comes to mind is invaluable. It truly is like using a Swiss Army Knife. It does it all... it uses your current location to point out restaurants, activities, etc. Awesome.
Version 5.5 2011-05-02 3
I generally rely on Trip Advisor as a great resource to kick off a trip.  It was wonderful in Italy finding lodging and out of the way, excellent restaurants.  I would recommend. My issue is w the iPhone app. I can't seem to find a way to build a trip or save favorites. If it is there, obviously not intuitive. Please fix it soon. I am planning a trip to Spain and need it.

I love being able to read the reviews and get different perspectives on restaurants and hotels before making a decision to go there.
Version 5.5 2011-04-29 5

Product
Version 5.5 2011-04-29 5
Love it.  Wish there was a way to save some of the sites or hotel so when ready to book, the site is already there.  Have been sending to web browser and bookmarking it instead.
Version 5.5 2011-04-29 5
Awesome for hotels on the go
Version 5.5 2011-04-29 1
On iPad the app is impossible to move from section to section or change locations. Loved it on pc hate it on iPad. Totally app fault but don't bother downloading on iPad. You'll be disappointed. Less than one star.
Version 5.5 2011-04-29 4
Easy to use layout, been waiting for this app for a while. Kudos.
Version 5.5 2011-04-28 4
Whether you are researching or visiting far from home this is the perfect app to plan your vacation.
Version 5.5 2011-04-28 5
I downloaded numerous travel apps for my trip to ireland and none were better than trip advisor.  What makes so good is that it shows you places by closeness.  Some other apps show you places or activities in order of rating and they could be very far away.  I much prefer this trip advisor app to the places app.
Version 5.5 2011-04-28 5
Very helpful app. Especially if you need to book cheap flights or find a nice hotel.
Version 5.5 2011-04-28 5
This is a great App and I cannot think of one negative.  I use it all the time and like it more than the website.

Great app. So helpful especially in an area that is unknown. Just wrapping up a trip on west coast... Enjoyed researching/mapping out the next days activities while relaxing in my hotel. Thought info and pics very accurate as well as navigation. Makes me feel familiar in places I am not familiar with... Also great for searching for specific stores and restaurants and entertainment.

I use TripAdvisor regularly. I think it's one of the most useful apps available. It's quick & easy, making it a wonderful alternative to the regular site for quick info on the go.

I absolutely LOVE Trip Advisor and this app! It has been invaluable to me in my travels and travel planning!

This is a great service, but the site for mobil devices is not to my taste.  Skimpy, confusing, nade for dim users.

Version 5.5 2011-04-27 3
Good app - it provides almost everything that the website does, except you can't email links to other people or bookmark favorites. Not very helpful if you're planning a trip. Definitely still using the website even on my iPhone.
Version 5.5 2011-04-27 5
Easier to navigate than the actual website and the best travel site bar none.
Version 5.5 2011-04-27 5

The mapping is especially clear on the iPad. A great tool for drilling downs to the area of interest.
Version 5.5 2011-04-26 4
Great that it free and very easy to access. If you like reviewing hotels, etc.....this is the app for you
Version 5.5 2011-04-26 5
Typically more useful than aaa
Version 5.5 2011-04-24 4
The app has a lot of hotel specific information collected in one place, from independent reviews and un-doctored photos etc.  The map is not always accurate.  One beachfront resort showed up in the city interior and when I zoomed in on the map the pin labels vanished.  Still, very useful.
Version 5.5 2011-04-24 5

Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
This is a must.  My family uses Tripadvisor every time we travel and have found the content to be accurate and the site easy to navigate.  It's even easier with the iPad app.  Highly recommended.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 4
It is a great app.  The only complaint I have is many of the reviews are old and some of the attractions I was looking at are now closed.  It would be nice if they would update the attractions.
Version 5.4 2011-04-23 5
One of my first apps and I think it is great!  Lots of good info.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
All in one place to get local information! Great app! Great site!
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 4
Very helpful app to have while traveling. I love being able to research hotels and b&b's on the fly, as well as restaurants and things to do. I can't imagine traveling without it. 

Cons - I wish it was available offline for those times when there is no network connection, maybe some way to download certain towns or regions. Also I don't like how it kicks me off when there is no network and then I have to start all over again.

Overall though, very nice resource.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
Really intuitive app. Easier to navigate than the regular online version IMO. Looking forward to using on my next trip.
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
I always use trip advisor before traveling. This app makes it that much easier and I can actually use it while traveling
Version 5.5 2011-04-23 5
Found the perfect B&B for our anniversary from my phone--and avoided a few disastrous motels. For the app, I wish the list of venues had an icon showing which Ive reviewed and visited. Like Gowalla.

Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
Been traveling for a while now and it has proven to be useful and helpful.
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 4
The app works well, easy to use, interesting reading -- the juxtaposition of contradictory reviews is amusing.  Need to recognize that the folks who tend to write rviews are either very pleased or very unhappy with their experiences.  I'm planning an extended vacation and this app is helping me get a handle on what I can see and, and where I can eat while on the road.
Version 5.5 2011-04-22 5
Great application, everything you need for traveling

Excellent design, simple and efficient you can be searching away very quickly and look for different options as well, would be nice to be able to narrow down your flight searches by airline before inputting the dates and going to the search window to see which fates your preferred airline operates on.

Other than date a must have for anyone looking to travel. I also found that trip advisor recommendations are on the spot.

My dad actually uses the regular website for his business trips. Sometimes we look for perfect hotels for our vacations. My family is going to Branson, MO sometime this spring or summer, and I went on the app store to find a travel app. I came across this app, and I decided to try it out. When it loaded up, I selected the app to see if it would work. It did! Since my family is going to Branson, dad asked me to look for a good hotel. Its not really that hard. All you have to do is:
1. Tap "Hotels" in the main menu.
2. Type in the city or airport your hotel is in or near.
3. Find the right hotel, and your on the page of the hotel or resort.
You can make reservations, look at the photo gallery, read the reviews, or even go to the hotels website. Here's an example.
I first tapped the "hotels" button in the mIn menu. Next I typed in "Branson, MO". Then I scrolled down and tapped "Marriott's Willow Ridge Lodge", which you will be familiar with if you've seen Disney's Wilderness Lodge.

I am still here in Florence after Rome. All the forum advisors and reviews that I read and advises from Donna about Rome were a HUGE help. Thk u and will definitely use tripadvisor for next trip!
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5
I'm a big fan of Trip Advisor on the web and this app is just as goodie not better.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 4
You should be able to access your TripAdvisor account info but you cannot. Also it would be nice you were able to save searches so you didn't have to fill it in all the time.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 4
Very easy app. Easy to navigate and search reviews.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5
I have used trip advisor for a number of years for travel. Now use the iPad app all the time! User friendly and ratings generally spot on.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5
Like it a lot.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 4
very useful for planning trips
Version 5.4 2011-04-21 4
So far so good. Easy to use.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5
This app has helped immensely in trying to find a honeymoon spot. I would highly recommend it for anyone plan on a trip of any size.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 4
I gave 4 stars simply because the app lacks the function of only showing awailable hotels for specific dates. If that function is added, it is the best app for the job!
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 5
It is a great app, better than the website actually.  Very clear and organized.  Thanks and nice work.
Version 5.5 2011-04-21 3
So far so good. I will write a full review upon return...

Information about all most anything, from hotels, restaurants, popular activities, to the must-do's right in the palm of your hand.
Version 5.4 2011-04-20 5
What a great little app. I like using this app for out of town business, of course, but this is also great for some in town travel when I'm just trying to find a different place to eat around me. It's cool!
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 5
I use it whenever I'm out of my element. It's been 5 by 5 for me!

Best app ever
Version 5.4 2011-04-20 5
Some small limitations, but it's awsome
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 4
I use this app a lot- only downsides are it's sometimes confusing to navigate and when you press the back button on the forum it takes you back to number 1 instead of the previous entry.
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 5
I don't book anything without checking the reviews on TripAdvisor first! They have never been wrong. Intuitive app; highly recommend!
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 4
Tons of great info on what to do,where to eat,stay,etc. Highly recommend. Easy to navigate.
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 4
The app works great for what it offers. But it'd be nice to have the ability to set flight fare alerts like on the web site.
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 5
Wonderful app.  Use it every time I travel.
Version 5.5 2011-04-20 5
So happy I have this on my iPhone.  It makes travel more reassuring.

Help me so much always! From hotels to restaurant, always my best "bud" app.
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 3
Good app. Just needs more things to see to do. Every possable fun thing.
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 5
Should be called "personal compass." helped us on family vacations and on our current anniversary getaway.
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 2
An app consisting of just an embedded browser does not make for a good user experience.
Version 5.4 2011-04-19 5
Easy to use! Wealth of travel info right at your finger tips. Fast also.
Version 5.5 2011-04-19 5

I love, love this app.  We travel a lot and use the on line version a lot in the past.  I just got my iPad and loaded this app right away.  It is so easy to use...even better than on line.  We can even take it with us now on the iPad.  What a wonderful travel resource!

Good app.  Easy to use and gives useful info.
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 5
Easy to navigate and get some feedback of hotel guests. Some seems to be too much or not true at all... but others give good info about property and location!
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 4
User friendly and giving access to vast amount of information. Could work snappier though.
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 5
Nice
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 4
The app asked for a rating. So I did. So far so good
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 4
Es muy conveniente xq te da varias opciones del mismo pueblo q quieres visitar. Me resolvio muchisimo  :)
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 4
I've used this online for a while but just got the iPad app. The app works even better! Very useful.
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 3
This is an interesting app because it includes more than the usual bunch of hotels,  check the reviews carefully... Even the genuinely worst (& I mean hideous, bedbugs & all) manage to get plugged w some hillariously great feedback. But the app likes to bug you constantly with push notifications much in the same way this same organization likes to bug you with stupid emails if you have an account with them. That is unfortunate as it makes an interesting app seem more like junk.
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 5
Cool app and dependable.
Version 5.5 2011-04-17 5
Great for researching hotels

I am a big fan of Expedia.com, however this Expedia application completely useless and I am not going to continue using it unless some helpful changes are implemented. First of all, hotel search is extremely limited and not much helpful. If you do search for hotels in let's say "Naples, Italy" it gives you hundreds of results of hotels all over Amalfi coast that are not even in vicinity of your particular search and destination interest. There is no way to select a specific area so you are forced to browse thru bunch of results that are not even related to your search. More over, you have only 2 options to sort results either by Popularity or Price. So if you are looking to search for only 4 stars hotels and above, you are out of luck. 
Also, there is no way to limit your search by specific amenity. Like I wanted only hotels with swimming pool, well there was no way to search it that way. They expect you to go thru each individual listing and look for this on your own. Which is fine, but then why would I even bother to waste time with Expedia app if it doesn't really help me to accomplish anything. They want you to quickly book hotel thru the app but fail to understand that people don't just book first hotel they see without actually being able to do a research and ensure it meets the expectations. At this point, TripAdvisor app is much more useful in doing all of the above.
Version 5.4 2011-04-16 5
This app makes it easy to leave my notebook at home and travel light!
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
One of my favorite apps!
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
I live by TripAdvisor. Don't leave home without it.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 3
This is better for those just planning their trip for them it is great.  But for some reason the mobile version does not state who I am other than member which doesn't help me in the forums.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
Great! A user-friendly mobile version of the online site. Perfect while out on location!

Version 5.5 2011-04-16 4
Awesome
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 4
I used this app to book a whole vacation without even going into a separate browser.
It's got a nice layout and let's you do everything you want including airfare.
I wish there was more pictures of the resorts, but that's up to users to upload I guess.
Version 5.4 2011-04-16 5
Great app I travel overseas a lot and TA helped me on funding the best hotels and attractions in Asia.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 4
Handy to have when planning a trip.
Version 5.4 2011-04-16 5
We use all the features on this site....hotels, restaurants and attractions and have never been disappointed.  I recommend restaurants that are not chains.  Local restaurants = Local flavor = Local small businesses.  Support the backbone of our economy!
Version 5.4 2011-04-16 5
Incredible tool on the road. Forget the old maps and tour books.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
Use for anything that has to do with travel. The reviews and information is easy to use. The best phone app when traveling and need information quickly.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5

Good app and handy if you are looking for something touristy to do near you while on vacay!

So great on the touch!  Can't wait to get an iPhone!!!
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
Great. Period. I dot know what people expect this app to do other than check hotel, air, and car availability. It does ll that amazingly at your finger tips. I guess the people who don't like this app would like the app to pay for their trip as well.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
The number of reviews allows you to really gather information to make the right vacation decisions.
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 2
The app seemed convenient but it was not easy to navigate and it kept crashing. I am not impressed
Version 5.5 2011-04-16 5
No business traveller should be without it. Accurate and to the point.

Forgot our printed travel materials & print ours from Trip Advisor at home when we left for a 2 week vacation on the Big Island. This app has been invaluable in checking reviews & recommendations for restaurants, beaches & points of interest. LOVE that you can press a button for 'Current Location' and get local recommendations  even if you don't know where you are!

There have been so many occasions where this app has been invaluable in showing good restaurants when we were stuck for options. 

Only downside I would say is that it lists too many tour companies in the "Things to do" in some Russian cities... Which makes those "top" ratings dubious.
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 5
I've always been a big fan of Trip Advisor and never go anywhere without clearing it through TA first, but this app makes the experience easier and even more fun to explore. Thanks!

This is a great app- only wish is to be able to filter by price for the hotels! And perhaps distance. Very appreciative for what it offers though!
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 4
The app is pretty good. But there are some options that are missing, like open a link in safari, or send a link to tripadvisor's page in email.
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 4
I love reading and researching trip advisor. It's the best way to get the true vibe of hotel, especially knowing nothing about a new visiting city. And since working at a hotel, I appreciate the honesty, some reviews are to harsh and need weeding out, but 85%of the reviews I read, I agree with.
Version 5.5 2011-04-14 4
Works good, loads the basic things of interest pretty cool

You need to navigate into this app. The more you become familiar with it the more you realize how very much it has to offer. I was truly afraid to go to Europe because it was such an unknown, but reading the reviews from people just like myself has given me the courage to travel 6,200 miles, google earth calculation, not quite boldly, but confidently.

Version 5.4 2011-04-08 5
I used trip-advisor always before and while traveling but this app makes my life easy to search anytime.
Version 5.4 2011-04-08 5
Just wish that one click would take me back to initial search page.
Version 5.4 2011-04-08 3
Looked at restaurant listings for my own area. While the stated addresses appeared to be correct, the location on the map for several was very wrong. It appears to confuse state and county routes placing some restaurants in the wrong town as much as  30 or 40 miles from the correct location. It also listed a restaurant which has been closed for at least 2 years. It is a nice application but I would certainly confirm the correctness of the data before acting on it. Maybe its better in large cities.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 4
Haven't got to use it out of town but I have played with it before we leave and love it! It's going to be great using the nearest food and "what to do" option. We are a family that argues on where to go because we don't know what's around and always end up mad because something was just down the road we love!
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
This app is the best and I suggest it to anyone who is interested in traveling cause it helps you with anywhere u wanna go.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Very easy to use
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 4
Great app.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
I'm very glad I found this app. Saves time and my marriage. I mostly appreciate the maps that show where I am and where I need to go. That's great when the husband is driving, if you know what I mean. This is the first thing I will pack when going out of town from now on.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Easy to use and very helpful when planning a vacation or just looking for a place to shop or eat.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 4
Very good app,speedy and efficient.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Traveling often my time is spent orienting and asking questions about the local fair. Not any more! This app has saved me so much time, now I can enjoy discovering not searching.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Very easy interface and many good reviews, pics. Etc. I'll bring this everywhere
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
I'm stuck in a coffee shop because it's pouring outside and i don't have an umbrella... But I'm sorta stressed because I need to book a trip. TGFTA (thank G-d for this app!) - it let me do everything I needed to do right from the comfort of my warm, dry booth!  The only thing it doesn't do is guarantee sunshine on your vacation...but maybe the next version will do that!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
User friendly interface makes it easy to find the right accommodations then access the hotels website right from the app to make a reservation.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Very Nice Apps. Recommended to all.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
I always use trip advisor for hotel review when travel abroad, this app is very easy to use and cool! Love it!
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Best flight app I've used. Easy. Plenty of options. Thanks!
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 4
We stopped here on a long drive with a 2 & 1 year old. Very nice place with on site restaurant that was good enough, free wifi, pool, and small fitness center. Staff was courteous (but a bit understaffed. It was 5 pm and everyone was trying to check in.)  A lovely stay
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Easy to use cuts out a lot of leg work!
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 4
I absolutely love how convenient this app is! I can compare and search for flight prices as well as hotel reviews & LEGIT activity ideas all at once.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
This app gets you information while on a trip quickly and easily. I'm just using my iPod touch and free wifi. The app really helps me to locate hotels and restaurants.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Great functionality for browsing on iPad :-) love that it brings up hotel website without leaving app!
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Great app for traveling to Vietnam.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 5
Excellent resource while traveling! Great for finding local gems near wherever you are at the moment.
Version 5.4 2011-04-07 3
Quite good, but, how does one get "fare alerts"? It is very confusing!
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
Always a great resource and I use it every tine I travel!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 4
I'am a travel agent and I love coming to this site to read reviews and give my clients suggestions or recommendations of activities they may want to try.  Often, i refer my clients to this site if they are choosing a vacation or they are trying to decide between two or more vacations. I also use trip advisor personally for planning our get-aways. I have come to find it to be very reliable.
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
Great!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
Tripadvisor on the iPad is a great app.
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
It is so nice to see real pictures instead of the staged photos from the hotels website
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
Love it!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
Easy to use. Great results. Fast. What more could you want.
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 4
Helps prioritize planning and sightseeing.  Suggested feature: add some structure to reviews so people can fill in top likes, dislikes, tips, nearby food/sights/hotels etc to make it easier to parse and find info.
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 4
Sweet App....anything you need to see or know about a hotel is there!! Love it
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 4
Tripadvisor is an essential traveler's item to have in his tool kit. Planning an enjoyable trip is exponentially easier. And who wants to plan an unenjoyable trip?
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
Always loved tripadvisor and now I have it with me on the go always.
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 4
But annoyingly asks you to review it practically the instant you open it the first time.
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
Good app to have in your pocket. Easy to use.
Version 5.4 2011-04-06 5
I love how informative trip advisor the web site is, and this app takes all that information and outs it in a very easy to use format.  Great app, great company.

So happy it's on iPad!
Version 5.4 2011-04-05 5
Works well all the time!!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-05 4
I love the app.  The only thing I don't like is that you can't check rates easily, and can't find some of the app places on the actual website...
Version 5.4 2011-04-05 5
Trip Advisor is the best.  Very helpful. You can find anything you need for making your trip a success!
Version 5.4 2011-04-05 5
They really do have a quick app for finding the best travel deals. Hit 'my dates are flexible' and it finds the cheapest deals spread put over a couple months. Great job!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-05 5
I love Trip Advisor!  I am in the mist of planning our family vacation and it is making it so easy to compare and contrast.
Version 5.4 2011-04-05 5

Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
It's great for planning your holidays. Holidaying mistakes can be avoided.
Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
Tripadvisor tells you like it is! Every experience is valued and very accurate!
Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
When I started using TripAdvisor it was very helpful when I was going to the
Caribian. I can get cheap tickets for flights.
Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
Love that I can use the app to view what is currently around me or to research an upcoming trip at any location. A great app!
Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
Wouldn't book a trip without it. So helpful!
Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
This app has been awesome on our trip to Florida so far.  Just being able to pull up the restaurants around our current location has been a life saver and we discovered a couple places we wouldn't normally have gone to.
Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
I'm a frequent traveler and use this app all of the time. Super easy to use and to navigate.
Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
Tripadvisor is the best site to use to plan a vacation and now they have an app!! Perfect. Great app.

Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
Everywhere I go, it helps me find the local gems in the area
Version 5.4 2011-04-04 5
Use tripadvisor for hotel recommendations and urbanspoon for food recommendations!
Version 5.4 2011-04-04 2
For two nights in a row I tried to book hotel reservations thru the app and it made my reservations for the wrong nights two weeks after I needed the room.
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
We travel approximately 200 days a year and use Trip Advisor every single day!  Only wish is that you could identify pet friendly hotels and hotels and restaurants with truck parking??? That would be our perfect world,
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
Excellent app
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 3
I type destination Shanghai,China because I don't know the name of the airport . The result is 'invalid information' and can not suggest any possible airport to me. 

So consider yourself ok.
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
Great app
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
It's like be able to ask hundreds of people at one time and most love to tell the bad parts so it's reliable

Always love tripadvisor online.
App is very good, but it's not as easy finding specific attractions.
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
We use Trip Advisor prior to making reservations. Ease of use and a variety of reviews provides peace of mind.
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 4
Good site
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
The best travel site. The app is just as good as the site

Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
Awesome

This is awesome! If you could display the reviews quickly would be great... Unlike now!!!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
Easy to use, great for traveling with IPAD.
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 4
I always used this at home. Now I can take with me wherever I go.
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
Just tried this for my I pad.  I love this app.
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 2
The Trip Advisor iphone application has an option to filter hotel search results by price, but there is no filter to find results for pet friendly hotels. Until this is improved, this is not a very useful application for many travelers with pets that need to be able to locate the pet friendly options at a glance. Instead they must painstakingly click on and read the information for each individual hotel. Once you install the app on your iPhone, this becomes even more problematic because if you try to go to the regular website version via the Internet, you are automatically defaulted to the application. Please, add the hotel pet friendly filter to this application!!! If this change is made, this would be a Five Star App!
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5
In Amsterdam and loving this app.
Version 5.4 2011-04-03 5

I have used TripAdvisor for several years for travel in the US and Europe. It's easy to use and all the great info is literally at my fingertips.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
Great for checking quick reviews!
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
Works well in every way.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
Great for vacation ideas in a hurry.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
We have become avid TA users. It is a great way to figure out the appeal of a place before we go. We are also getting into posting reviews about the places we experience. Great app.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
Love this app.  Easy to monitor flight prices from anywhere.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
I love tripadvisor and This app is great.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
Used it on a road trip to Myrtle Beach and knew we only wanted to drive approximately 1/2 way.  We weren't sure when we were going to get tired and used this App to be able to see what hotels were 30 minutes to an hour down the road.  It was a great way to gauge how much farther we wanted to drive before there we were in a place with no hotel choices.  Will recommend to anyone taking road trips!!!
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
I always consult TA before booking anything
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 1
I realize Russia probably isn't part of trip advisor's market focus, but if you're going to offer a product the least you could do is refrain from spreading misinformation. this app is absolutely useless here, offering all sorts of incorrect price and location data.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
I live in NYC. It is great to explore the city.
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5

It's simple and it works
Version 5.4 2011-04-02 5
Have been using the website for years. The app for the iPad is awesome.
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
This is the first app that actually is very user friendly from minute one... It also is in affiliation with popular travel sites like Expedia. Great app, and most importantly it's free....
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
Using this app to map out our trip to Rome. The UI is smooth, easy to navigate, and makes planning any trip a lot more fun.

Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
Great app very informative
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 3
This app is fine but really sorely lacks the ability to bookmark items found. This really is a handicap when trying to build an itinerary.
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
Very cool app! It's nice to hear other people's opinions before going somewhere. Highly recommend.
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 4
Would love to be able to bookmark stuff so that I can remember what I was interested in for later. Being able to check off what you have already done would also be great.
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
For planning a trip and also travelling, this app rocks!  Anywhere i was, i could just press 'near me now' and had a list and map of all the cool places nearby.  Love the traveller reviews and tips - like having a friend 'on the inside' wherever you go!
Version 5.4 2011-04-01 5
Muito bom o aplicativo. Estou sempre em diferentes cidades do mundo e esse app me ajuda a escolher os melhores hoteis.

Always room for improvement.
Version 5.4 2011-03-31 4
The app is good but has some search improvements that would make it better.
Version 5.4 2011-03-31 4
Being able to see all the reviewed restaurants near your current location is so useful. Haven't had a bad experience yet using TripAdvisor!
Version 5.4 2011-03-30 5
Would (literally) be lost without it. Have found so many great deals, hotels, restaurants, and attractions through this application. A must have whether you're traveling around the world or looking for an evening out in your hometown.
Version 5.4 2011-03-30 5
Easy to view pictures; easier than the regular site....

I'll stick with google. Faster finds, better listing function for item searched for. Good start, needs more work.
Version 5.4 2011-03-30 5
I don't know how I got along without Trip Advisor.  It's enabled me to find some fantastic hotels and restaurants and I love that you can upload pics.  I also like the fact that hotel management often responds to reviews.  Thanks for a great app!
Version 5.4 2011-03-30 5
This app is awesome for sitting on my couch looking for a hotel for my next vacation on my iPad!

I use it for reference to see how others rate hotels before I book mine.
Version 5.4 2011-03-29 4
Wouldn't want to travel without it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-29 1
Tripadvisor is indispensable. However their mobile website has everything the app has including the two app function buttons, home and locations nearby. Also with safari, you can bookmark to save and you can quickly scroll to the top of page after reading reviews; two useful things which you can't currently do in app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-29 4
Very easy to use. I like the helpful information on locating hotels along our travel route.
Version 5.4 2011-03-29 2
Rashes alot and gives you the wrong info on prices on the majority of hotels but the app is very neat and has a lot of potentials maybe expanding their searches to travelocity and orbits might help.
Version 5.4 2011-03-28 5
Awesome AND free....thanks!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-28 5
Much easier than running a PC (period)
Version 5.4 2011-03-28 4
I've used trip advisor often on my PC glad I got the app. now

A genie in my pocket.

Easy to use and good info.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
Used this app while traveling from New England to SC...fantastic to find nearby restaurants with GOOD food after a long day of driving.  Also useful to find banks, stores, gas while away.  Came in very handy!  A well-done app - thank you to its creators!
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 4
But relocate Southern Sun Ikoyi Hotel to Alfred Rewane road where it's physically from Osborne road in your map which is not the correct location.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 3
I love trip advisor. So excited that it's an app now. But I was writing a review and there's no save button! The app froze telling me I had no Internet connection when I was on wifi. When the app finally reopened my long a** review was gone. Yelp saves your work trip advisor doesn't.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
Love this. Always ck this site before booking!
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
Great app
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
Very helpful app (and website). Worth the download. Easy to use and understand
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 4
The app itself is excellent and is as good or better than the web site.   However, the recommendations in Trip Advisor while great are not necessarily comprehensive and I find tend to be more tourist focused.  For example Zagat will provide better more accurate and more comprehensive restaurant recommendations.  In the end user based reviews/rankings are great but have limitations.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
This app saved me time and frustrations

Very useful and clean UI !
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 2
Trashy. Got panhandled in the lobby and security told me that was part of the "experience". I realize a lot of people that stay here are trashy but when I spend >$100/night I expect a clean safe room w/o being harassed by bums.
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5

I have nothing but praise for Tripadvisor.com. The breadth and depth of information is staggering. Like so many before me, I have depended on Tripadvisor.com to plan a variety of travel experiences. The app is a pale but attractive approximation of its mother. It offers a superficial first round of info, which for a casual traveler may be sufficient. But it simply doesnt go the distance for building a true itinerary.  The app ends up frustrating me, and then I go the website. To quote Marvin and Tammy: "Ain't nothin' like the real thing baby."
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5
The best!
Version 5.4 2011-03-27 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5

App is ok but needs more of the filters that are available in the full site such as non-stop flights and planing tools.
Version 5.4 2011-03-26 5
This app is definitely what everybody would need if they feel lost and confused about a place they wanna travel to!

I already liked the standard website, but the app is even better. Very convenient, easy to use, and well laid out. The maps work well and it feels almost easier to review hotels than on the normal website.
Version 5.4 2011-03-23 5
We use this app all the time for planning trips, especially hotels.  I have found the reviews to be very accurate.  The restaurant reviews are also very accurate.  We use the iPhone version when we are looking for something nearby in a new city.
Version 5.4 2011-03-23 5
I use Tripadvisor every time we travel and find that its combination of recommendations of places to go, stay and eat have been very helpful for choosing just the right vacations and days out. The suggestions for restaurants, hotels and places to visit located on the map according to my present location or destination make planning even easier. The reviews and photos are a click away and street views too! Great job! I know I will be using this app a lot!
Version 5.4 2011-03-23 5
This app has found me Good food and decent accommodations all around Asia and the US. I have not tried it elsewhere, but I'm sure it's just as good.

It's useful when I was travelling. It helped me to find the restaurant in KL .But you must know how to find out the information is truth or untruth on trip advisor.
Version 5.4 2011-03-21 5
I've used Trip Advisor for years to plan my trips; it's so handy to have the app at hand for a change in plans or a spontaneous day trip! Trip Advisor has never let me down. I've gotten some of the best restaurant suggestions from this site/ now app. It's also a great source for activities.
Version 5.4 2011-03-21 4
Great app but could sort by the official class (stars). Sometimes its better than the user's rating.

We travel often, finding hotel reviews is a walk in the park with this App, including photos, location, street view.  Simply amazing!
Version 5.4 2011-03-20 4
Wonderful app but wish it was easier to save reviews you like to your personal location folders. For now, you have to copy reviews/materials and get out of the app to paste content in your email etc. Then when you head back into the app you start all over again from scratch. :( 
Otherwise, very informative app.

So far I have found this app useful for day trips and also for local advice. I can't wait to try it out on longer distance trips. I only wish there were links to webpages too for museums and other businesses.
Version 5.4 2011-03-19 5
This is one of the best free apps out there so far!

First of all I love, love TripAdvisor and all its contributors. This app is well done and is perfect the way it is if you are a spontaneous explorer. The combination of knowing your location and highlighting the things to do around you is very convenient and enlightening. 

With that written I really want to give this app 3.5 stars because of the following improvements I desire: 1) you start over at the home screen every time you open the app, 2) doesn't sign you in to your TA account, 3) doesn't let you accumulate a list of things to do for your next trip (e.g., a couple of weeks ago I read about a great restaurant in the city we are visiting, but now I found myself asking, "What was that restaurant I read about?"). 

If you can give this app a memory then it will be a five star hit.
Version 5.4 2011-03-19 5

I might be missing something
Version 5.4 2011-03-19 4
Used it for excursions on an Eastern Caribbean cruise. The suggestions from locals and people who have been there are invaluable. 
I even use this app in my own hometown to see what others know that I don't. Very helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-19 5

I only just downloaded this app while on a long road trip with my boyfriend. We are driving until we are too tired to continue, and I cannot wait to try one of recommended hotels for Birmingham, AL. I like the map feature and it is really easy to navigate !!

The app just makes a different frame for the mobile web site. No need to take up space on your phone when you could just use their web site. All functions work fine though.
Version 5.4 2011-03-18 5
Nice one
Version 5.4 2011-03-18 5
Absolutely live tripadvisor and this app adds great mobile access to their excellent service.  I've used tripadvisor for every trip I've ever taken on my own as an adult!! I would really be lost without it
Version 5.4 2011-03-18 5
I always plan my trips using this app. It works great for finding cool things to do near your current location. Works great for those of us that act as our own travel agent. Highly recommend!
Version 5.4 2011-03-18 5
Simply put, this place is something special. The food is outstanding. A pleasant surprise in this area.

Version 5.4 2011-03-18 4
The app is very nice in all ways but one. I use tripadvisor for all trips and generally do most of the planning for a trip using the site. For this I use a computer and would very rarely use an iPhone app. Where I believe this app is meant to shine is when you are on the vacation. Currently I'm in Chiang Mai and using the app to help find restaurants and things to do. And while I'm sitting in a cafe using the wifi- great!  Love it finding my location and sorting results by distance from me. But imagine my dismay when I leave the cafe with app in hand- headed toward a restaurant, viewing the map, and then the app informs me it only works with a data connection and closes. Now I no longer have the address or information about the restaurant. I wander aimlessly. 
I hope you get the point. At the worst the app should just inform that data connection is gone and let the gps work with the already downloaded map and address of most recent location. For real kudos though- anticipate that this app will get used in lots of places that finding a wifi cafe won't be easy. Allow some pre-loading of content. It couldn't be that hard. 
I believe all apps should actually be disallowed from closing due to no Internet. I understand functionality will decrease, but that doesn't mean it has to close. I think apple should make this a rule. 
Anyway, glad there is an app and it is quite useful when you have data. Work on the (many) times users will not.

Lohve this app, 'have had many successful hotel bookings solely from  from the pool  of people contributing to this site. Large demographic of people ( young or old, couples or singles. helps you weigh in the negatives and positives and make better booking decisioonsd. Definitely a useful tool!
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
Initially I wasn't impressed. That all changed when I started shopping for flights and hotels! Now I don't bother with any other site or app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 3
It works well for searching for things on the fly, but full version works much better for writing reviews and digging deeper.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
Kinda new to TripAdvisor but am quickly falling in love with this app!  I'm in Cabo San Lucas right now and have used this app to find some awesome places to eat!

Helpful. Love the Photo Add Feature...
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 4
I am always changing my mind about my next destination.  And then I am sometimes at a loss for a suggestion of where next to go! Even so, Trip Advisor comes to the rescue.  Know the town starts with a "G" but can't recall exactly? Start typing and this app will suggest for you. want to know what to see and do there? It is only a fingertip away. Worried that the bed and breakfast is too far from the local attractions? Ask to see where it is on the map...again with just a finger touch you have the information. Trip Advisor is speedy, smart, quick. Love it.  Use it daily ...even for my home area recommendations!
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
There are lots of places to get advice, but Tripadvisor makes it easy to find everything I want in one place.  You need to read a little, but learn a lot.
Version 5.4 2011-03-17 5
I love this convenient app for my iPad. Since I take it with me everywhere I go, Trip Advisor is the perfect travel companion.

Version 5.4 2011-03-14 5
Tripadvisor has been my go to site for my travel research for years. I've used the iPhone version in the past but this iPad version with the additional real estate is such a refreshing experience. I think the layout is great but I wish there was a way to make reviews full screen instead of just on the left pane. Maybe there is a way to do this that I haven't figured out? Anyway its only a small gripe, I am still giving it 5 stars!

Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
This app is by far the most user friendly traveler app I have tried. It is so easy to search, and also easy to add reviews which is something that most apps don't allow through your phone.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Simple and easy; a must have if you want to enjoy the places you visit!
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
As good as the web page or even better. Love it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
This app is an awesome tool to have for local places and also when your on the road.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Love trip advisor and now it's at my fingertips. Very easy to maneuver. Great.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 4
It is really usefull
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
I've had a wonderful time finding restaurants in my hometown. It is a nice blend of TripAdvisor online and the GPS capabilities of the iPad.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Had to do a quick check on hotel reviews last night, downloaded the app and searched for reviews. Within 2 mins I made a decision on where NOT to stay.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 4
This app rocks as my GPS is outdated.
It really lowers the frustration level when traveling.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Love this app!
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
So far it looks like a great app
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 4
It's nice.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 4
Great app

This app is very helpful. Love all of the travelers recommendations and ratings!
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Been using it all the time since got it.  Greatness
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Wonderful app. Very similar to the online product. Lots of reviews, pics, etc. Loads fast, no crashes.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 2
I love the site, but the app doesn't work well. First problem: click on get rates. It won't really get you rates. It asks if you want to check other sites for rates which is weird. Second problem: scrolling through the pics. There's something wring with this feature. You can scroll side to side easily, but not up and down without a fight. Strange.
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
Great!
Version 5.4 2011-03-12 5
We use it extensively when traveling for hotels, restaurants, even golf course reviews.  Fast, reliable, great maps.

Version 5.4 2011-03-11 4
Nice
Version 5.4 2011-03-11 4
It is a very easy to use program and very informative.
Version 5.4 2011-03-10 5
When traveling I most appreciate hearing the good, the bad, and sometimes the ugly, from other travelers.   I use Tripadvisor either first to seek suggestions or secondly to check on a suggestion someone else has given me.  I find the reviews fair, honest, and informative.  I have been pleased with every suggestion I chose to take. Many Thanks for keeping me informed, safe, and a happy traveler!
Version 5.4 2011-03-10 5
Valuable reviews, especially on hotels.

Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5
Great app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 4
Very helpful app.  Just about perfect.  But one thing I would add would be the capability to search within the hotel review. Also There isn't much info about spas.
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5
Excellent usability and information source....Thank You!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5
Makes it really easy to find the best accommodation.
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 4
Informative and will help plan with any vacation or business trip
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5
This app is just as good if not better than the site itself. Fast and easy to find any hotel or things to do in the destination of your choice. I'd would pay for this app, if it wasn't for free.
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5
This app is great to have handy!
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5
Usually... Had a few where I've wondered what the fuss is about, buy generally very good.

Version 5.4 2011-03-09 4
This is a great app! Just what I need.
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5
Excellent App!
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 4
Love the trip advisor app. Just like the website, it is easy to use and navigate. The forum, however, could be better. If you are sifting through a forum with more than 20 topics, you have to hit the "add 20" at the bottom to see the next 20 topics When you hit the back button after opening a topic, the app takes you back to the beginning so you have to "add 20" until you get back to where you were. This can get annoying, especially when the forum has hundreds if not thousands of topics.
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 4
This app is very useful but is missing some things like the possibility to se vacation rental homes witch are what I prefer using when I go on vacation. Please add this feature !
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5
We really enjoyed using this app to let everyone know about the great places we found to play on Kauai. We will definitely look to Trip Advisor to figure out where  to play on our next adventure!
Version 5.4 2011-03-09 5
I can't believe such an organized and helpful app is free. I use this app to plan all my vacations.

Looking up flights has never been so easy!
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 5
So far loving it.  Uses where you are to suggest restaurants, things to do and lodging.  Have not tried lodging but other two categories are great and ratings / reviews are good.  Will keep using it....
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 5
Great
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 4
This is a nice app to get an idea of what u want to know about the local places.

I've used trip advisor on my PC before. Love that I can take this useful planning tool with me on vacation!
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 5
Never take a trip without checking it out first.
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 5
Love trip advisor. It's been an invaluable tool in planning my trips to Italy and now Australia.
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 4
Easy to use, well laid out app. Makes finding travel info as easy and convenient as the online website.
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 5
Great travel resource.
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 5
Much prefer the mobile app for iPhone and iPad over the website.  The amount of information shared by users at your fingertips is more than priceless - and the best part is that it's free.  Thanks TripAdvisor app team!
Version 5.4 2011-03-08 5
Love it

Great free app. Really helps with price and location
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
Great App.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 3
Decent app, but does not find everything in the area.  Using other sources always a good thing.  Search needs to be smarter and search within area when requested - I often got results on different continent.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
Like this application. Good one.  Easy to search for hotel n restaurant etc.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
Great App

Using it to plan a trip, definitely helpful.

My wife and I live by trip advisor. We have traveled in the USA and Europe, and trip advisor has never steered us wrong. Having the app is just another plus.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
I love this App. It has helped me find cost effective flights and travel info. I'd recommend it to my family, friends, anyone!
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
My employees and I use this app to find restaurants, gas stations etc.  It has been a tool for us.

I've used this for domestic travel and having quick access to tripadvisor has been invaluable!
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5

Great for travel planning. Almost everything you get on the full website in the palm of your hand. I LOVE IT!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 4
Wish I could build a list of to do things using the app info!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 1
So, I accidentally hit "no" for the "use my current location" function.   I havet been able to use it. I looked in a few places and I cant seem to fix it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
Muy buena. Excelente!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
Never go on a trip/vacation without first consulting trip advisor.

Trip Advisor is the must-have resource when traveling. It's extremely helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
I love this app! I use it every time Im going travel
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
In the past I relied solely on google maps for planning vacations, but finding this app made it so much easier. You just type a location, and immediately you know what to do and where to stay. It greatly helps in filtering out what is really worth seeing and doing. I also find it beneficial that you get to see user photos of hotels - great help for me and hard to find elswhere. Easy to use, like a good ipad app should be. I also use the ipod version too, both are good.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 4
I love this app. Very helpful.....I would recommend to anyone.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 4
This app is great! I can put in any location and get info for just about anything I need or want to find!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 5
Great app.  I'm using it more than I ever thought I would.  Easy to use....couldn't travel without it.
Version 5.4 2011-03-07 4
Some apps are even better than their corresponding website, and Tripadvisor is one of them. While they could use a few more filters, and I'd prefer if the app would remember where you last searched, this is still a very worthwhile download for frequent travelers.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Extremely helpful. Easy to use.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Use extensively, ratings accurate, descriptions helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Thank you for allowing me to vent about a disheartening and unpleasant hotel stay.  Your site was easy to use and even though I have never written a review before I do travel a lot and will definitely check your site before I make the mistake of booking a hotel on Pricelines ratings again!  Keep up the good work so that people will know what to REALLY expect from the services they are buying in good faith!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
A must for all travelers
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Restaurants section is rough but so is every other app.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Awesome app! Easy to use and fully functional. You can write your reviews and access your trip advisor account. I love it!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
It's the truth!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Love the trip advisor app, easy to navigate. But no feature to save the properties I'm researching to my trip folders. So when I do find a hotel or restaurant I want to remember for later I have to fire up the webpage. But the app is still where I prefer to surf.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
If you are planning a vacation, this is a must have tool.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Easy to navigate
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
A terrific app. Most reliable and easy to use
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
It's a great app--very helpful for planning a trip. One thing I wish you could do is a search for hotels by desired dates filtered by price.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 3
I love the resources that tripadvisor has. 

The ipad version is limited compared to the web version?

Wish it had the ability to access trip folder and save individual forum posts to trip folders like on the web site. I use that feature a lot when researching trips.  The inability to do that on the iPad version lessens it's blue to me..
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Has everything you need before you go on a trip! 
The problem is, however, when ur being nice and writing a review, the programmers didn't take enough time to make sure the application somehow SAVES your written review after telling you your nickname is taken so u can just easily try another nickname and not have to rewrite the whole thing over!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Very helpful app so far.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 2
Helpful with hotels. Not helpful with restaurants. I am at least 40 minutes from NYC including a bridge - and that is with no traffic!  However, I  get NYC choices. 

The eateries in my area are not updated; there are good places to that are nowhere on the list. Our town is the county seat and does not exist according to Trip-advisor. I can't enter it and my zip code brings up the inconsistent information.

Quite importantly, there is no separate listing to search for kosher restaurants! Kosher is not an international cuisine, it is a way of life, and many people would make use of a separate listing. Often vegetarians search for kosher dairy restaurants. There are a large contingency of kosher travelers and folks who keep kosher who want to find places they can eat. RETHINK, please.

My husband travels most of the year. I thought this would be a great app for him and for myself at home and on the road - I was disappointed.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Love love love this app!  Use it alot and post reviews.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Easy to use. Quicker than going to the webpage.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
It's one of my favorites!  I always use it before eating out and staying at hotels.

Great app, very easy to use and provides you with all the relevant information in a user friendly format.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
TripAdvisor is really the most complete travel app on the AppStore today. We have been able to book rooms while driving into a city, research restaurants in small towns in Vermont, and find the best deals on flights to Hawaii.

If you only want on app for travel, this is the one I would recommend.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Great app for travelers!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Excellent app that replicates most of what you will find on tripadvisor.com.  A must for those who want real answers about hotels and an essential tool for do-it-yourself vacation planners.  5 stars.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Get it! The App is very helpful and easy to use.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Extremely useful but sometimes crashes. Works after you open it up again though so no big deal.  I use it just about every time I leave the house.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
This is a really useful app. Wayyy better than all the travel books I could have bought.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
I like all aspects of the app but they need to improve the forum on iPad. When you return to a thread it sends you back to the first page of the thread. Otherwise very helpful and nice.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Easy to navigate, very fast and well organized!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Great app for on the fly traveller reviews and research when a PC not available
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Still not as good the website. Need to add more functionality.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5

Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Lovely, but would like to be able to save searches.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
I tend to be hesitant when getting an app, but this is fun and easy!  I have found out a lot about the town I live in; restaurants, places to go and things to do. My main reason for getting it was to help me plan a vacation in Belgium and it has been extremely helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
I love having Trip Advisor in a handy app! I wish the filtering was as good as it is on the website, but it is still really useful when I'm planning trips or traveling to new cities.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
Good app
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
Very handy. Very easy to use. Just like their website.
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
This is great to check out the latest reviews of hotels for my upcoming honeymoon.

I love the app. Better than most, but the filtering elements on the web are much better. Too much scrolling, not many options to save time.  Overall, very useful, but...
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
This app is the shizzle
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 4
How could it be any easier than to literally travel the world by review, right from the ease and comfort of your own phone! Puh-lease!! Bon Voyager!

As a travel professional, I trust Trust Trip Advisor for honest reviews on hotels and restaurants.
From Budapest to Dallas and all points in between!
Version 5.4 2011-03-06 5
On any continent, Trip Advisor is the only guide you'll need!
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 2
If you want something with GPS interaction, this app is good. If you're using your iPad while sitting on the couch, hop online instead.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
Such a great app.  Perfect for travelers needing to find a spot on the go.  Easy to navigate the maps and click on points of interest, accommodation, etc.  Would most certainly recommend for anyone traveling without a concrete plan.  Invaluable when it comes to booking and investigating on the go.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
I'm glad to have it on IPhone, gives me quick & helpful access to all what I need on the go. Thanks.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
Easy to use.

Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
The best app at all times
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Easy to use and simple interface.  Makes on site reviews easy.

This app is a must have for those who enjoy eating, traveling or seeing ;). Neat and easy to use interface on the iPad. Its so nice when developers get it RIGHT!

Love TripAdvisor and love this app. The integration of their extensive reviews with mapping makes the app even more useful (and interesting) to me than the website. I've had a crash or two, so it's not yet perfect, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, nonetheless.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
There are so many options for travel and lodging but you don't really know what you will end up with until you experience it. Then it can be too late and you've ended up with something you don't want. Anywhere can post pretty pictures and have people write nice things about it on the website. Trip Advisor gives you the input of people who have already experienced what you are considering. It helps to know what you are getting yourself into...
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
We use this app all the time.  Great information, especially when in new areas.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
Nice features.  The forums could be improved. Sometimes I have to scroll thru the same reviews to see something on pages other than the first
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Wonderful for a iPhone or anything similar.  My family camp quite a bit, great for your toolbox
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
Good not great

I downloaded this app while planning a motorcycle trip for my 6yo daughter and I. What a great way to plan some fun things to do along the way!
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
I like it better than the website; easy to use and I like how the hotel website appears in the nav frame instead of opening in a new screen.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Awesome
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 2
I like the app and the info provided but what's frustrating is that I've submitted several reviews which were never loaded onto their site. I'm not sure if they're screening these or it's just a poor process, but it skews the results making me question how representative of reviews this site really is.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 5
Great app to use on the fly and on vacation. Times are busy...  Love that it's integrated with my location so I can research dinner options while lounging by the sea mid day. :) recommend

This site gave me info that did not show up in a google search. 
Gives really great insight to lots of destinations.
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 3
LOVE the website but this app keeps giving me +1 day with no area to adjust times. If I wanted the next day I would have put the next day! I didn't select flexible dates either. The website let's you adjust the departure and arrival times as well as number of stops and duration of layover. Please add that option to the app!
Version 5.4 2011-03-05 4
I love it because I travel so much! Just wish this app included phone numbers because having to book on line is hard when trying to hurry up and get it done while traveling.

The only issue is there is so much information, I get bogged down by the choices!
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
This app has great detail.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
This app is the one we use to make decisions when we travel. We don't eat or go to attractions unless it is rated by the trip advisor.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
Helped me make a choice on my honeymoon!

Very cool app to find things like flights for holidays.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
I'm a frequent traveler and trip advisor user. This app has been very helpful when I'm nowhere near a desktop or my laptop. Great job!
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 2
App is slow, doesn't keep track of what you were last looking up, and has a very poorly designed UI. It just feels like they didn't know what they were doing when they wrote the app. They should closely examine how apps like maps and mail work, and try again.
Version 5.4 2011-03-04 5
Highly recommend
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
Overall we have used this app while traveling, and it has been very useful.  I wish it had a place to save favorite things when searching.  I am always scrambling for a pad of paper and a pen to write myself notes. I'd like to be able to save a bunch of ideas in the app and then string them together into an itinerary with a map feature.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 4
I always use Trip Advisor.  The app is pretty good nut it is not as functional as the full website.
Version 5.4 2011-03-02 5
Wouldn't be able to book spring break without it!

Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
Great app
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 2
I would give it 5 stars but I mostly use Tripadvisor for the hotel reviews, which are given a small space in this app. Here you are browsing the hotel info in this narrow window, while the map takes up almost two thirds of the display! I can't figure out how to customize this (make map smaller), if the feature exists at all.. Also, there is no street view in PR, so what's the point of the map really?

I prefer to use the safari version, where I can adjust the size of the reviews to my preference and read comfortably for hours..
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
Great app!!!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
Thanks guys, your product is just awesome!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
I really like this app as an extension of the full website I can carry with me on my iPad.  The single enhancement I would love is the ability to remember where I was in my last session.  Whenever I close the app and come back I have to drill back into a very specific forum or hotel search.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
I always check out the reviews on TA before staying anywhere!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
So useful ...
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
Wouldn't go anywhere without checking it out on TripAdvisor.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
I love this app especially when I'm out of town and need to find a decent hotel. If you rely on reviews to decide where to stay then this is a great for you. Also, if you want a way to write quick reviews, you found the right App.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
It's my first go to tool for planning local and destination visits!
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
Awesome. What else to say??
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
I like it a lot
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
A very useful app if you can learn to discern the real reviews from the fake.  I try to read all the reviews for any particular place and average them out.  I always ignore the ones that recommend another establishment within the review as I know several business owners who have written disparaging reviews to puff themselves up (sad but true).  Posting particular items tried is very helpful as are the tips about peak time service.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
One of my favorite apps
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
I just started using this app and plan to try it next month when in Brazil and Argentina. I checked out the local restaurants and other milestones and they are very well defined location wise. I will be able to give better review in a month.
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 4
For free, it does what it needs to.  Wish it had a fare alert though.  Would make 5 stars
Version 5.4 2011-03-01 5
Great app for travel, I use it every time I'm going to book a hotel.

Easy to use and incredibly helpful, this app is fabulous.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
I am a Travel agent and this app is far better than many others we use. Now that I found it, I can't live without it. Helps me getting much more information that the hotels themselves say. The other consumer's opinions are very valuable and I take them most of the time into serious consideration.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 5
Downloaded this app while in Puerto Vallarta.  Found great places to eat and awesome attractions. If you travel, this app is a must have!
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 1
I can not get this app to work on my iPad. Whenever I try to find something near me I get "location services are unavailable", and location services are indeed enabled for the app. I can not even get a response from the app when I type a city name. The support website is no help at all.

During our 10 months of travel through Asia and SE Asia we have used this iPad app, and written reviews, to help us decide where to stay, what to see and where to dine. I especially like the 'where we are now' GPS feature. An indispensible travel aid.

Love the app, but don't like that it assumes that I am always looking for something near the location I am in.
Version 5.4 2011-02-28 3
app shows only a fraction of the available lodging shown on the website.  must be the ones who pay for placement that get this treatment--I feel it is less satisfactory for that reason

This app is very useful, although slightly tougher to navigate than the regular desktop version. The mapping feature works great. Trip Advisor saves the day.

Version 5.4 2011-02-27 5
I use the app everywhere I go and feel like I have the kind of local knowledge of restaurants and hotels that usually only comes from actually living in the area...!
Version 5.4 2011-02-27 4
I struggled a little bit finding the hotels when I was trying to research them while I was on my trip. Would be nice to have a way to integrate with the GPS better. I'd admit I'm a novice so maybe I haven't figured out yet. 

Even though I started out negative, I've always gotten a lot out of the app and website! Written from people you can trust and the ratings across multiple reviews is always spot on!
Version 5.4 2011-02-27 5
Excellent in every way!
Version 5.4 2011-02-27 5
I like the app better than the website!
Version 5.4 2011-02-27 4
We have used this a few times and have been satisfied. Read the reviews carefully since "regulars" at a restaurant may overlook things travelers don't like.
Version 5.4 2011-02-27 5
My personal tour guide in my pocket.
Version 5.4 2011-02-27 5
Very user-friendly.  Especially like the on-the-go function that allows you to search for nearby places as you're driving (not for use by driver!).  One thing I could not seem to do on the app was write a review for a new establishment.  I had to go to the website to do that.  Otherwise, great app!

Fans of Trip Advisor will appreciate this great little app. Works beautifully and will enhance any trip you ever plan or take...on vacation now and have referred to it a dozen times in three days for maps, hours of operation, what to order in best restaurants etc. Can't believe it's free - Thanks!

You just cannot book hotels or go to restaurants in an unfamiliar (or even near to home) location without checking this site. App. Is reliable and accessible.

I was a frequent user of the website and now enjoy the app.

This ap is excellent. I live in a metropolitan city and I find that this is the best go to city guide for me when I want to behave like a tourist. The ap is no frills, simple, loads easily, is not buggy, and is very well laid out, making it a true favorite. Other companies should take some tips from you guys. Perhaps TripAdvisor should add a second vertical to their business model and become a mobile developer. Mobile is the future and they've certainly got IT! Well done.

Version 5.4 2011-02-25 4
Pretty simple, very easy, able to make full reservations!
Version 5.4 2011-02-25 5
Near me now feature is genius.  Works great.
Version 5.4 2011-02-25 5
One of the best iPad apps I have seen...essential.
Version 5.4 2011-02-25 5
We use this app mostly for restaurants--even just to find new restaurants in our own city. We use Trip Advisor several times a week and for every vacation and love it!
Version 5.4 2011-02-25 5
My husband and I decided to take a last minute trip, so I downloaded trip advisor and wow it's amazing! The hotel finder is great. I'd recommend this to anyone who travels!
Version 5.4 2011-02-25 5
Gives u every detail you need to know before visiting a new place!
Version 5.4 2011-02-25 3
I use Trip advisor all the time on the PC and I like it, but I find the apps hard to navigate and are simple but not intuitive. Slow, slow, slow. I would like to see  pop up menu that would navigate with more explicit instructions.
Version 5.4 2011-02-25 5
I'm not sure how I travelled before I had TripAdvisor and this app in my bag.

In many ways better than website, due to know ads and other distractions
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 5
I find the navigation/interface a bit tricky, though.
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 5
Easy access to guest reviews. Helps in figuring out the lemons out of all the possible choices
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 5
I love this app. I haven't experienced any problems and the latest update works well :)
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 4
First started use of app in Barcelona while traveling alone with my kids. Very helpful in finding good restaurants near our hotel.  Would love to have this sync up with my phone version of the app, so I can "research" on the iPad and take the info with me on the phone.  Also, have it "connect" with google maps for easy directions.  Would recommend it as an essential tool for travelers.
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 5
I have always loved and trusted TripAdvisor, so I am so pleased that their app works so great and was free. Bookmarks would be great!!!!
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 5
Hard to believe such a robust program is free. Works well on my iPad
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 5
Great app!!!  Very easy to use and great for traveling!  My favorite app!!
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 4
My husband & I use often & with quite a few trips we have rarely been disappointed in results. Especially love help with restaurants on our travels.
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 2
I've been researching a property that has 500+ reviews and want to read them at various times on my iPhone or iPad. 
Every time I close the app I have to then a spend major amount of time looking for where I left off. Isn't there anyway this app can save a page, location, hotel or anything? A bookmark to the exact page that was last visited or "favorites" would be SO helpful. The reviews by visitors are so helpful.
Version 5.4 2011-02-23 5
All the infos i need!

Using it tonight on trip. Very easy!

It is easy to use and very helpful. I love all the options it has.
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 4
Great way to find food or a place to stay with reliable reviews
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 4
. . and it's the same one mentioned by others. Sometimes the map gets fooled by, well, who knows what. Planning a trip to Italy, I hit the MAP button for my hotel in Manarola and it puts it in the wrong town.

Generally, this is a very useful travel planning resource, as is the iPad version. The hotel reviews have been most helpful in knowing which ones to avoid!
Version 5.4 2011-02-22 4
My wife and I are spending a month in Venice, FL and have been using Trip Advisor extensively to find good local restaurants.  Without this app we certainly would have been stuck in some pretty lousy places.  Thanks for a very useful application.

Based on the design and interface alone, and that it' s free, it is a potential 5 star app.  However, there was a rather glaring error on my very first usage, so until it proves to me that this glitch in the algorithm is fixed, I won't be able to rely on it.  I have reservations in NOLA at Hotel Monteleone, so  I looked it up.  It's my first trip to N.O., so I was not exactly sure where this hotel was, except I knew it was in the heart of the French Quarter on Royal Street.  When I clicked "show on map," it dropped the pin and hotel info about a mile away from the area where I knew the area of the hotel was.  A little panicked at first, I went to another site to confirm exactly where the hotel was.  I then examined what could have caused the problem within the app, and it was quickly apparent.  The app "interpreted" "Royal Street" to mean "Rue Royal," which is the French name for Royal Street.  However, and it's a little bizarre,  but the area of the French District has both a Rue Royal and a separate street spelled in the common English of Royal Street.  This may have been a 1 in a 1000 occurrence, but since it was my first usage, I have to wonder.  I'll change my review to 5 stars if I use it for a while and have no similar issues, because as I mentioned, this app is very slick, and everything else about it is a 5 Star design.

It's nice and easy to use so far. This is 4th time it's asked me to rate in 5 mins of using so that was annoying
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
Great counsel. Helps to plan.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
I was traveling in Southeast Asia without having done any research. My trip was sudden and simply unplanned. I used Trip Advisor all the time, especially to find places to stay. I never went wrong using it for accommodations.
I would recommend it to any traveler!
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 3
I like the app but do not appreciate the reminder to rate every time I login. Had to ding the app for the unnecessary persistence..
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 4
I luv this app I think most people will like it too

Nice app for a quick reference of what you do. The feature to look for things near you is terrific!
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
Wonderful resource to gave at your fingertips!
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 4
The perfect personal assistant.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 3
I really love Trip Advisor for searching hotels, but when I brought up the app, it found my location and was on the restaurant tab. The listings are horribly out of date (which I reported). Restaurants that have been CLOSED for years were on there, but their replacements, some of which have been OPEN for years were not. If TA is going to list restaurants, you should make a better effort to list CURRENT restaurants.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 1
It'd be nice if the authors would take a little more pride in the app. Back buttons don't always work. If you filter on a particular category you can view the first 20 items returned, but trying to page beyond that results in removing the filter conditions. I recommend that you avoid the frustration of this app - try a different source for your travel information needs, at least until the app authors bother testing and fixing their bugs.
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
Love tripadvisor love the app!
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 1
Must have some bugs on the iPad app. Takes way too long and kicks you around in an incorrect order. Sad.

Used this app to checkout reviews while my wife was booking an upcoming trip.  Super easy to use and overall a great experience.  For free, it's a must have!
Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
My husband and I have been on a road trip for 17 days (so far), this app has proven to be invaluable for finding good, clean hotels at great prices.  We even found an amazing king suite in Hollywood for about 50% less than crummy hotels in the same area, incredible!  I highly recommend this to anyone planning a trip, whether near or far!

Version 5.4 2011-02-21 5
The folks at Tripadvisor never cease to amaze me. I never go anywhere without first checking my hotel and "things to do" list with them first. Their service is a much loved tried and true industry standard, which this app reflects! Thank you Tripadvisor for many successful years of European travel.
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5
I wish more apps were like this.  No login required to write reviews. No nagging.  Clean interface.
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5
Makes vacation planning so much less stressful and very easy to use!
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5
Been using for several years now, as we like to try new, hi-end places. Choosing between destinations, and between where to stay at that destination, is accomplished for us by reviewing the Trip Advisor reviews from other discerning travelers who have gone there ahead of us.  People who take the time to write a review are usually very informative, and caring.  We will never take a trip without checking the reviews on Trip Advisor -- even if we have been there before (as things sometimes change).  The photos people contribute with their review are also very valuable....a picture tells a thousand words as they say. Lastly, I respect that often times the hotel management will also look at these reviews (sometimes they even post responses), as this tells me they are striving to listen, and adapt.
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5
I've used the web version for years. The iPad app will now be my preferred choice. Using Trip Advisor has helped me find the right places to stay and enjoy our vacations.

I have been using Trip Advisor (TP) for years. It is one of a kind. Everything you need to know about your destination (almost everything) is here. In my field (healthcare) we call it "evidenced-based" (EB) and TP is EB travel. Read the reviews and you will definitively find details that you need to know. Good job guys!!!!!
Version 5.4 2011-02-20 5

Most apps are not useful, but this is the exception.
Version 5.4 2011-02-18 5
This is a good app for the phone.  I was happy to see that trip advisor had an app for the phone because I really think the full website is a very useful tool.  Reading the reviews on places gives you a heads up on what to expect.  When you read all positive reviews about a place then you feel better about going.  If you read all negative reviews then that is definitely a flag to stay away.  If you read mixed reviews then it may or may not be something to try.  It helps because you are not going in blind.  Thanks to everyone that takes the time to give a review on different resorts, restaurants and all other general helpful tips.
Version 5.4 2011-02-18 5

Trip Advisor is a great website and this is a great app. Get loads of info from fellow travellers about hotels, attractions and places to eat etc. I've used this app and the website to get information and guidance when booking lots of holidays and it is a great help. It gives you first hand commentary on a place rather than the hyped up, glossed up website or brochure from a hotel or travel company.
Version 5.4 2011-02-17 4
Could you add a bookmark function?

It's a decent app, but you need a way to filter hotels alphabetically as well as search for a specific hotel.
Version 5.3 2011-02-15 3
overall this app does what i want and expect.  However please fix the constant barrage telling me to download the app when I already have it!  I receive email updates about my chosen destinations, very nice. When I click within the email to find out more information it goes to the website and hits me up to download the app, very annoying.  I already have it downloaded.  Make the email notices and app work together.
Version 5.3 2011-02-10 5
Wow todd, good app
Version 5.3 2011-02-06 1
I got this app because i love the website, it is my favorite and the only one that i use to find cheap flights. the thing is the app that i got don't have the flights search engine. I just can search hotels, restaurants and things to do. ):
Version 5.3 2011-02-06 2
I love TA and use it all the time.  However I am disappointed with this app because I can't save anything or even email myself a link.  So when I find something interesting it is frustrating.
Version 5.3 2011-02-05 3
I like that's it's easy to look things up in a format that fits well on the iPhone. There is a lot of info and maps etc. My biggest problems, which is why it didn't get a higher rating and if they would fix it I'd give it 5 stars, is that if you close the app for just a few minutes it makes you start a search over. It would also be nice if it would remember recent searches. One other nice to have would be to be able to flag a hotel or something that you may want to visit or look up more info on later. Right now I have to do screen shots to remember. It would be nice if you could then sort these by trips and it would be available then on the website.
Version 5.3 2011-02-05 3
Nice BUT it is limited on hotels, other app's will show at least twice the number of hotels on map. Sorry but I went elsewhere !
Version 5.3 2011-02-01 4
Because it draws from the popular and fabulous Tripadvisor website, it has a lot of hotels, restaurants and attractions in its review database. The "find nearby" feature was VERY useful to us when we needed to find a late night stopover hotel on a road trip. It tells you how far away the nearest hotel or restaurant is, and the direction (SE, NW, etc.). The mapping feature didn't seem to work well, though. Keep improving it.
Version 5.3 2011-01-29 1
I don't want the map all the time!  Cumbersome and hard to use.  I will stick to the web version.
Version 5.3 2011-01-27 2
I just tried the trip advisor app. I typed in the exact name of a lodge I was looking at on the trip advisor website and the app can't find it. Not exactly efficient.
Version 5.3 2011-01-24 3
I tried it here in Kuwait and its pretty good

Going to Paris next week inshallah and I hope that will help me there
Thnx
Version 5.3 2011-01-24 3
Not nearly as good as the TA website, trying to post a review is a nightmare. It has you write the review first, THEN log in. If you have trouble w login, your review is seemingly lost in cyberspace. SO AGGRAVATING!!!  Yes, repeat search feature is missing, and maps are not what they should be. Needs a LOT of work!!!
Version 5.3 2011-01-24 1
Does not work with first gen iPod touch
Version 5.3 2011-01-23 2
I was hoping for an easy way to search reviews but there was not even a way to search at all.  I really only wanted this feature.
Version 5.3 2011-01-21 3
I love trip advisor but it would be nice to have a favorites tab, so I don't have to continually search for places/things to do. 

Will give 5 stars when I see that feature if it's at all possible
Version 5.3 2011-01-18 1
I use TA's website a lot and was very excited to have an app to use. Don't waste your time, use safari and select full site instead of thus app. Mapping results were WAY off from reality and the app won't show u an address so that u could use a decent mapping app to find what you're looking for.
Version 5.3 2011-01-17 1
As a fan of tripadvisor website, I was so disappointed. 
-The tool doesn't remember the latest search, so if you want to search other things for the same dates or the locations,you have to enter them over and over again. 
-It kicked me out several times because it crashed. 
-I was reading reviews in the car and my network connection was suddenly gone. It popped a message saying that it could not work without network and kicked me out of the app. It was so annoying!
Version 5.3 2011-01-16 4
It's a good app but I wish I could log in under my user account and save favorites.
Version 5.3 2011-01-16 2
The web app interface on the left side of the screen is ugly and hard to navigate.

Also, when on the map after you've searched for a hotel, you can't move around and look at the area on the map because it'll move you back to the first hotel that was found. Fail.
Version 5.3 2011-01-15 4
I bought the Trip Advisor app a long time ago, before they had an iPad version.  I deleted it...twas not very good.

Through a lucky iPad hiccup, ALL my apps were re-installed, and so I updated then.   WOW !

The new iPad TripAdvisor is excellent...VERY useful, even in my home territory.  It reminds me of the first time I came across TripAdvisor on the PC....it was a revelation re information for travelling.  The iPad app is just that good.  

Good work.
Version 5.2 2011-01-14 3
It is a well designed app however I was looking for a tool to provide timeshare resort comparisons. I needed an app to compare the benefits of my timeshare-alternative.com verses the retail timeshare marketplace. Hopefully, they will add more timeshare resorts. 

Thanks
Version 5.2 2011-01-11 2
Not very useful though... Haha but amusing.
Version 5.2 2010-12-31 5
Translates well to ipad app. Now I'll have access close at hand.
Version 5.2 2010-12-30 4
Really useful!
Version 5.2 2010-12-28 1
Keeps asking for location services on my iPod touch...maps can find my location, why can't this app?  FIX IT
Version 5.2 2010-12-26 4
Would give 5 stars if they allowed bookmarking. Besides that, I love Trip Advisor!
Version 5.2 2010-12-20 5
All the best of TripAdvisor, customized for the iPad.  Love it!
Version 5.2 2010-12-20 5
I love being able to take TripAdvisor with me when I travel - it has so much more than hotels and flights, so it's great to be able to access it during trips for things to do, restaurants, etc.

Easy interface and love the location-based advice!

Thank you TripAdvisor!
Version 5.2 2010-12-18 5
The map to the right is too large and the reviews on the left column would be easier to read on the right hand side and in a much wider column.  Disappointing.
Version 5.1 2010-11-26 3
Love TripAdvisor, but the app won't let me go beyond the first 20 cities. This can be problematic in larger cities.
Version 5.1 2010-11-26 3
Please add the possibility to flag places  as favorites or transfer them into the contacts.
Version 5.1 2010-11-12 3
Wish it had the Cities I've Visited like the Facebook app.. Then it would be 5 stars!
Version 5.1 2010-11-11 5
Every summer i travel to a diff place and need ideas to stay. I always look on the web for hotels but every hotel says there the best & has the best pic but this app has pic and reviews from real ppl rather good or bad. Just an awsome app!
Version 5.1 2010-11-07 2
Works well for finding restaurants and hotels, but is impossible to use for any review writing, say when you are fresh from the experience. Interface is very limited.  Does not have forward browsing, does not store incomplete reviews.  Often frustrating.
Version 5.1 2010-11-04 4
Was doing some on-the-fly research during our recent Tuscany holiday and found this app very handy.  But it desperately needs the ability to bookmark places you've researched.
Version 5.1 2010-10-31 1
Doesn't have enough filters when browsing. Needs option to search within map. If you exit the program and come back to it, it clears your search info. Good concept, horrible execution.
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-22 2
Even when I tell it to use "current location" it is confused where I am...
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-18 5
I liked this app before, but really like it since the last update.  Keep it up!
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-17 3
Glad there is finally a tripadvisor app. But really needs hotel photos and would love to see the forums on here.
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-13 3
I like the layout of the app. I'm sure details will be updated as time goes on.
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-11 2
Buggy, featureless, and devoid of what makes it a great website; I didn't need to try for very long before I went looking for alternatives. Disappointing.
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-07 2
I can't acces my TripAdvisor account. No option to save Favorites, places etc.
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-05 3
It's ok, but I find Yelp more useful for most of my needs.
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-03 3
Love it or hate it, TripAdvisor is a fact of life in trip-planning when it comes to choosing hotels, at least for me. Glad to have it in a mobile app version now, and thanks for keeping it free!
Version 5.0.1 2010-06-02 5
If you dig TripAdvisor's website, this is a no-brainer. The restaurant reviews are very helpful too. This is the review app I use the most - and it's free :-).
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-30 1
How can it be an advisor if you don't have the facility here to add your reviews on anything.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-29 2
If your looking to get a quick overview of an area, this app will do. However it lacks a lot of features to make it useful. An advanced search would help you specify certain criteria you want in a hotel. The landscape mode shows the scrollbar in the middle of the screen which indicates this app wasn't tested very well.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-26 4
So far so good... I was happy to find this app and that it is free. Thanks Trip Advisor! But, I would like the ability to bookmark restaurants or POI for future reference on my next trip.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-26 2
1.  Can't filter by neighborhood
2.  In Boston, allegedly "nearby" listings were on the other side of town, in Cambridge!
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-26 3
Overall, I like this app, but it is lacking one IMPORTANT feature: the ability to post and view pictures of places. My rating will jump up to 5 stars when you implement that feature!
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-26 2
I always use TripAdvisor before planning ANY trips! The wealth of info on the website has saved me from many hotel nightmares! So, I was excited to see a TripAdvisor app. But *this* app has very outdated restaurant info! It has a listing for a restaurant that closed down over 15 years ago, as well as listing the restaurants that opened and closed down in this same restaurant's space! How helpful is that?I say stick with the website until this app is updated!
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 4
This application basically immitates the website in the sense of it being helpful, interesting and very informative.
I love TripAdvisor, it made purchasing flight tickets to Europe very simple.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 5
I've been looking forward to this app coming out! Thanks!!!
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 5
I think this one of the few apps that has nearly everything you need to completely plan a trip from your iPhone. Did I mention it is FAST? I have only a few other apps that work as fast as this one, I would hands down recommend it based on speed alone
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 5
Been waiting for TA to have an app. Kudos to them for making it free. It's just what I need.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 5
The bomb diggity! good stuff!
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 4
Access to My Trip Advisor to view my saved trip itinerary would make this app much more useful to me for traveling. However, overall very fast searches. To those complaining that the database is out of date, reviews are posted by users so start posting some reviews of places in your town and hopefully others will do the same!!
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 4
Would like to have this in an iPad version. Not a fan of iPhone Apps on the iPad overall.
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 2
Ok the app itself works and it could be useful, but the data is so out of date, how could this possibly be helpful?  I searched my local area (a very large town, which is incidentally 10 min from TripAdvisor's main office) for restaurants.   About a quarter of the hits were for places that have been closed for a few YEARS or more!!  Not very valuable advice.

Update your database!!
Version 5.0.1 2010-05-25 5
This app was good before, but the newest update has made TripAdvisor one of the best free apps available. It is very easy and fast to use, if fact I could not believe how little time it takes to look up an airfare on this app. It has to be the quickest I have ever seen. Highly recommended!
Version 5.0 2010-05-21 4
The new update changing it to all of Tripadvisor versus just restaurants makes a huge difference. It is a lot easier to find information and write reviews from the phone.
Version 5.0 2010-05-20 5
All trusted travel advise in one place, love it.
Version 5.0 2010-05-14 1
This is not an update.  It is a different program.  They updated it and installed a different program.  I want the old one back!!
Version 5.0 2010-05-10 5
Big fan of TripAdvisor - and this is the cherry on top! What a nice improvement to the Local Picks app by adding hotels, flights and more! Really comes in handy on the go. I can even review places while I'm still there! Sweet!
Version 5.0 2010-05-10 3
A bit better than before, but still needs some work to polih it up. The website is a much better place for info. Would like to be able to add reviews  in app and for some reason it wasn't able to find my location. Back button or recent searches would be handy.
Version 5.0 2010-05-09 5
This app is now the same as the website. It is very helpful for locating places like hotels and restaurants. It is a must have for me, I use the website to prepare for travel.
Version 5.0 2010-05-08 5
Use this all the time
Version 4.1 2010-05-07 1
Did this app go by a different name before?  I've never downloaded TripAdvisor but it's showing up as an update in the app store. Annoying.
Version 4.1 2010-04-26 2
Not nearly as useful as the TripAdvisor web site.
Version 4.1 2010-04-18 1
Mant of the local restaurants for my area are no longer in business. When I try to manually enter name/locations it throws me out!!!
Version 4.1 2010-04-02 4
please add a wish list that Alerts you when you are within a certain distance defined by the user.  There are times I am in an area and don't think to look up a place it would be nice if you could get an alert
Version 4.1 2010-03-31 2
I am a big fan of the Trip Advisor web site for hotels and resorts, but this is ridicuously outdated. It includes restaurants that have been closed for well over a year. I wrote a review that said "Closed" and they just ignored it. They need a button that you can press to tell them that a restaurant has been closed.
Version 4.1 2010-03-25 3
I'd find this app a lot more useful if restaurants could be saved for offline viewing. The European restaurant reviews are great when traveling, but I'd need a data plan to view them abroad.
Version 4.1 2010-02-20 1
Recommendation was not discriminating. Found the info useless.
Version 4.1 2010-02-10 2
I'm glad TripAdvisor is developing iPhone apps, but this is a weak first effort.  Where's the social aspect of the Local Picks Facebook app?  Where are the detailed ratings of food, service, etc?  City rankings?  Nothing is in this App except the name of the restaurant and location mapping.  Also, the first restaurant I looked up had the wrong address attached!  Needs work!
Version 4.1 2010-01-23 1
Lots of out of date info and very mediocre restaurants. And if there is one steak on the menu, it's listed as a steakhouse, one burrito, it's a Mexican restaurant.
Version 4.1 2010-01-22 1
On a recent trip through Texas, I found restaurant and hotel info woefully out of date. Some locations no longer existed!
Version 4.1 2010-01-22 2
Annoying problem with the iPod Touch. If you don't have Location Services turned on in Settings Just tells you to go away and try again. If you turn on Location Services you are apt to get an erroneous location if you are on a network hosted by an ISP far away. For example, I'm now in Kailua Kona Hawaii, and it's telling me I'm in San Francisco. At least now I can manually enter a location, but you ought to be able to do this right at the start, whether you have Location Services on or not. Then there is the lack of Hotel info, which I find the most useful part of Tripadvisor. If all you want is restaurant info, there are better apps out there, also free, with many filters, ratings, and a lot easier to use.
Version 4.1 2010-01-17 5
I love ta for their great user reviews.
Version 4.1 2009-12-24 3
App would be much more useful if it had hotel listings.
Version 4.0 2009-12-09 1
Since the iPod Touch doesn't have a GPS, the app is unable to determine location and doesn't allow you to enter manually. So basically it doesn't work and they should list only the iPhone as compatible.
Version 4.0 2009-12-06 5
We just got back from a 2 week trip through Italy.  Was able to get wifi here and there.  We used This app alot to find some great meals while we traveled around.
Version 4.0 2009-12-04 5
A great app now that it has the reviews available within the app. Also now lets you write reviews and take pics which makes it a pretty complete restaurant solution.
Version 4.0 2009-12-03 4
Love the updates, wish it was in it earlier.
Version 3.0 2009-11-28 2
Been playing with app for a few days. I am noticing that some of the restuarants locations are not at the correct locations on the map. 
Version 3.0 2009-11-18 3
Great app wonderful idea need to add the ability for users to update information.  It isn't bad to begin the database with some basic starting information but unless you are going to send scores of people around to verify and update information you have to give users the ability to either update their own or customers to add their favorites.
Version 3.0 2009-02-03 2
for 5 minutes. Weak selection once it came up.
Version 3.0 2009-01-19 1
Kills it for me. I should not need an iphone to be able to use it. What a waste.
Version 3.0 2009-01-17 1
It does not really work!!!!!!
Version 3.0 2009-01-13 1
Only provides access to restaurants but doesn't give much info in the app. What would make this app good would be to be able to access trip advisors data and write reviews. Still needs work, better apps avail. for restaurant searching.
Version 3.0 2008-12-05 2
Nice solid first start. Needs more work.
Version 3.0 2008-12-05 4
The new update is very well put together; great job to the developers who redesigned this app. It was pretty ok before but now has a more cohesive navigation to it. Well done!!
Version 2.0 2008-09-22 1
I'm a big fan of TripAdvisor on the Web.  Unfortunately they skimped on development of this app:
Version 2.0 2008-09-13 1
great potential but it could never locate anything
Version 2.0 2008-08-27 3
I can't seem to get the search filter function to work right. Also, it would be nice to be able to search by cuisine type. Other than that, a nice application.
Version 2.0 2008-08-18 4
I use TripAdvisor quite a bit and I trust the reviews and opinions of TA's users, so I was excited to see this app. Pros: Works well, does exactly what is described and it's free! But I'd like to be able to filter by type of food and sort (by distance or rating). Overall it's simple and it works!
Version 2.0 2008-08-18 2
Sad.  This looked promising.  However, attempts to change the filter proved futile.  The same restaurants turned up no matter how I set the "star" requirement or distance allowed.   I searched for instructions online that might let me know if the problem were user error, but only found the Trip Advisor site, not a site devoted to the iPhone Ap.
Version 2.0 2008-08-09 4
Finds nice restraunts. Only good if free, though
Version 2.0 2008-08-07 5
I have a very nice experience traveling to places you never been there before works nice very helpfull
Version 2.0 2008-08-01 5
I have used the web version of Trip Advisor for a long time which has also saved my butt when travelling from different countries and needed a place to stay last minute. So finding this "local picks" app was pretty cool when I found it. Too bad it doesn't do hotels and what not as well or other services and just local places to eat. Anyway, when I found this, the reviews ripped it apart and I was swayed from ever downloading this. I mean there is YELP, WHRRL, Yellow pages, etc out there, why would I install an app that was 1 to 2 stars the most.
Version 2.0 2008-07-31 1
What a disappointment. I am a big fan of the regular web version of Tripadvisor, and find the reviews of hotels, etc... to be very helpful. i was very glad to find this app - even if it only deals with restaurants for now. Imagine my surprise when i see that the app is just a front-end to open the same web page as you woud se on a PC - even with all the crappy pop-ups you get there. Trying to close those pop-ups on a small screen like the iPhone is quite the chore. I would have expected that the app would have pulled data from TripAdvisor content and displayed it in a readable way for the device. Nope. They took the lazy way out. I certainly hope that they change this to display data in the native iPhone app - not some pseudo web browser. Avoid this app until they do.
Version 1.0 2008-07-28 1
Not very good.  No way to sort (by distance, stars or alphabetically). Tried several times to read reviews and the app would stop and revert back to my main screen.  I hope they fix this.  It could be nice to have.
Version 1.0 2008-07-26 1
First time I used it, was at home to see how it worked.  I travel a lot.  No matter where I am, I fire up this app, it takes a bit of time locating where I am, and then displays the same restaurant list it first gave me for where I live, never for where I actually am.  Total waste of an app.
Version 1.0 2008-07-22 1
Visiting Monterey CA and this ap only displayed restaurants like, The Cheescake Factory, PF Changs, and Cali Pizza Kitchen. We all know Monterey has better taste than that. Yelp held the answers and worked much better.
Version 1.0 2008-07-21 5
Works very well for me. Only thing I'd like to see is a better interface and maybe the ability to be able to give ratings/write reviews.
Version 1.0 2008-07-20 1
Really like the idea of this app.  However, was in Cincy two days ago and it still thinks I'm there.  Seemingly no way to correct this even after closing and reopening it multiple times.  Even a free app should do what it's designed to do.
Version 1.0 2008-07-17 1
Wow,
I guess Bank of America and Trip Advisor are trying to beat each other to the podium to accept worst launch app for the iPhone. I can't speak to the terrible or incorrect information on restaurants because this app seems to think I am currently in New Jersey even though I'm currently in Texas. Um, ok. Don't install. Keep going.
Version 1.0 2008-07-17 1
You would expect this to come from someone's garage, not a large company.  Slow, mixes information for listings when you scroll.  It lists a local chinese takeout as mexican!!!!  It's too bad, because if it worked as expected it would be a great app for traveling and finding hidden restaurant gems.
Version 1.0 2008-07-16 1
Poor database of restaurants. Interface scrolling is jerky- names double up. Same restaurant often listed several times under different food style.
Version 1.0 2008-07-16 1
Some of the restaurants listed in Seattle have been gone for a few years.  Information is not very up-to-date.
Version 1.0 2008-07-15 1
Thinks I'm 90 miles away!!!
Version 1.0 2008-07-15 1
Right from the start it (the program) asks you / or tries to determine your position (Location)... that's nice, however, it NEVER determines your position. It only tells you to try again, and again...etc. That tells me that this program is poorly thought out or written. 
Version 1.0 2008-07-14 1
It's a very app it didn't even let me load the first page so I deleted it.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 1
Could not even find a place to eat that was down the street. Do not get it!!!!
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 3
It should allow you to input location being searched so you don't have to be in the area already. Did not provide nearby places.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 4
Be sure to call first, some restaurants named were no longer in business. 
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 1
I knew a restaraunt to be 8 miles away, yet this app told me it was only 1 mile away. Add that to the fact that the painfully slow list can't be sorted by distance anyway, and you've got one awful app.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 1
This could be handy little app if it offered up to date information, an improved UI and some more utility. 
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 1
This app doesn't even scroll smoothly.  I checked it out for about 53 seconds then deleted it.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 2
The application is very slow, with poor scrolling and window management.  Restaurant categories are often incorrect.  The built in "browser" that takes you to the TripAdvisor web site is marked as "incompatible."  Not ready for prime time.  Needs work.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 1
They haven't even attempted to refine this app yet.  Keeps the list unorganized and does not update to new locations.  Pretty much useless at the moment.  I would pay for something that actually worked and had a couple features.
Version 1.0 2008-07-13 2
Could be great, but needs work. Interface is klunky and slow, and when you hit the 'reviews' button, you get an "unsupported browser" message -- and then it suggests upgrading to IE or Firefox!
Version 1.0 2008-07-11 1
Phone #'s should click to call, of course - don't.  
Version 1.0 2008-07-11 5
Can filter restaurants by distance from you (uses gps), price per meal and how many stars out of 5.  Can also read in depth reviews of each restaurant from users. I tried it at 2 rest. And it was right on!  My city has over 1600 rest. In their database. 

Speed was fast on thurs before 3g launch. Maybe reported speed problems are due to servers being slammed?  Best app I have found so far and has already saved me money.
Version 1.0 2008-07-11 3
Decent app, but needs more selection of restaurants.
Version 1.0 2008-07-11 3
OK - I think the title is my review.  Here's what would be nice in the app.
Version 1.0 2008-07-11 1
...and I'm not. Very slow, locks up easily
Version 1.0 2008-07-10 4
It's a great concept, and love the ratings. It'd be a five if it was better polished.
