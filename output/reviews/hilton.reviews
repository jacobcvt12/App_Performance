Version 1.7.1 2014-03-04 1
This app continues to be a huge disappointment:

*Points are never correct (and do not match the info available on your website - how is this possible?)

*Continues to require me to add AAA number even though I tick the box to save it

*Sluggish and frequently crashes

*Please add ability to add reservation number to my calendar directly from the app
Version 1.7.1 2014-02-15 1
Big fan of Hilton but their apps and technology overall stink. Since I installed the latest app, it crashes every time I try to log on. I downloaded "the fix" but it still crashes at login!!
Version 1.7.1 2014-02-11 1
App freezes on calendar view. Have to force close the app. Useless if I'm unable to select dates
Version 1.7.1 2014-02-01 3
In the "Request Upon Arrival" function, it shows page not found... Can this get fixed?
Version 1.7 2013-12-27 1
Many functions are just for appearances....they do not actually work.  Shocking that Hilton can't pay software engineers to fix the app. It's a shame. 
The app allows you to change the username and password and whether you want the credit card number saved or not, but it does not actually save the changes!  It cannot find Hilton hotels in some locations!
Version 1.7 2013-12-14 1
I use a multitude of travel apps because they make life easier when traveling. Not this app. It was designed as if the person using it were sitting at a desk with PC. 

Re-design this thing or force me to use Marriott more.
Version 1.7 2013-12-07 2
I always check the "remember me" box, but I never works. I have to login every single time. And it never remembers my AAA number so that has to me manually entered every time as well. Easier to break out the laptop.
Version 1.7 2013-12-03 1
This upgrade is pointless since it keeps crashing.
Version 1.7 2013-12-02 1
Each time enter a city, it crashes down
Version 1.7 2013-12-01 1
Can't login since the upgrade. Totally useless - would give 0 stars if they'd let me.
Version 1.7 2013-11-25 2
Much better app than last. Problem is App will Not remember my hilton honors login info even when I click to remember. I have to type in every time. Also have to type in my AAA number each time. Makes app pointless if it's still faster to just make a phone call.
Version 1.7 2013-11-17 1
Like another reviewer, the app crashes repeatedly, every time I try to enter a city.  Previous to the latest update, it still didn't have the greatest reliability (and would never "remember me" but T least some of the basic functions worked. I'm HHonors gold, nearly diamond, and while I won't give up on Hilton purely because of a bad app, it would be nice to have a working tool on my tablet, instead of having to access via browser.
Version 1.7 2013-11-14 2
I'm not quite sure what they were going for here, but this really misses the mark. I kept it installed until my stay last week just to see how the check-in functionality works. Well, it doesn't. Standing in the hotel, the option was still greyed out. I had to check in at the front desk. What's the point? I don't get it.
Version 1.7 2013-11-12 1
The wheel just goes around and around. Or the page is 'not found'. I'm on wifi. No connectivity problem. It just doesn't work.
Version 1.7 2013-11-11 1
I logged into my account at least once a week for years either via the web or the old app.  Since the upgrade, it's been nothing but log-in errors.
Version 1.7 2013-11-09 1
Not user friendly; only shows available hotels on dates you put in which is a big minus because I often look at Hilton's entire brand and then decide the dates I am going based on availability; please change back to old format; when I put in corporate rate only hotels with corporate rate appear even when other hotels are available
Version 1.7 2013-11-08 1
This app used to work fine. Now it crashes every time I enter in the second letter of the location were I want to search for your properties. It's totally unless now.
Version 1.7 2013-11-06 1
App crashes mere seconds after opening. Can't do much with it.
Version 1.7 2013-10-31 4
I like the look and improved functionality of the update.  Being able to see the "number of stays or nights needed for next level" was a nice feature.  I have been unable to find that on this update.
Version 1.7 2013-10-30 1
I can't tell if the reservation is completed or not. After it's "done," it freezes and I can't go back to my existing reservations. Would be great if this worked!
Version 1.7 2013-10-30 5
Great functionality for bookings.
Version 1.7 2013-10-30 5
This makes my Hilton app as good as the website !!!!  Best upgrade I have seen.
Version 1.7 2013-10-30 1
Checking in and viewing reservations did not work before upgrade and still doesn't work after upgrade.  Worthless app. Too bad I can't give zero stars.  Step it up Hilton.  You are better than this app.
Version 1.7 2013-10-30 5
As a diamond member, I stay in a lot of Hilton brand hotels. This app is finally a well thought out app that appears to work well. I like that you can change your account settings right in the app. Great job.
Version 1.7 2013-10-29 2
I was so excited to see an update and all of the new features in the new app. However, in the first 2 minutes of looking around, the app crashed 6 times. You can't accomplish a single task. If you can fix that, I think this app could be great.
Version 1.7 2013-10-29 5
This update is much easier to use than the last one.
Version 1.6 2013-10-28 1
How can breaking an app be an upgrade?  Fire your developers. As a diamond member I am unimpressed.
Version 1.6 2013-10-27 1
I am a Hilton Diamond and thus frequent traveler and would really like this app to work but it just doesn't. I can't even log in - gives me an immediate error that me session has timed out - even though I have just put in my password
Version 1.6 2013-10-23 1
This app does not consistently remember your login.  Extremely frustrating.  That is the reason for the "remember me" button.
Version 1.6 2013-10-21 2
I don't recommend this app yet. The hotels are excellent, but the app doesn't match their quality which is odd. Needs passbook support for their rewards card like SPG. Plus comprehensive information on the rear of Passbook card. Plus passbook support for stays. I'll upgrade my review when they add these features in.
Version 1.6 2013-10-18 1
Why bother asking to remember my info when it doesn't? Way to help out Honors members.
Version 1.6 2013-10-13 3
Seriously?  You can't program the app to remember login info?
Version 1.6 2013-10-12 1
The remember me function doesn't work. The app is a crappy front end for a crappy web interface. Having the app tricks you into believing that you might be able to access your info, but no such luck. Terrible.
Version 1.6 2013-10-01 2
Soso
Version 1.6 2013-10-01 1
Doesn't remember hilton honors account info despite the remember me feature. Better to just use safari and go to the website.
Version 1.6 2013-09-29 1
This app is completely unusable, either do it right or just take it away, currently it is a waste of time
Version 1.6 2013-09-25 1
I can't get my app to load now that I have updated my iPhone 4S to the latest operating system.

Is anyone else having this issue?  

Is Hilton working to correct?

Major inconvenience.
Version 1.6 2013-09-19 3
The app doesn't remember you from previous sign ins and links to maps do not work.  It's ok but doesn't work well.
Version 1.6 2013-09-15 4
Remember me feature doesn't work
Version 1.6 2013-09-10 1
Doesn't remember who I am. Digging up my honors number is a PITA.
Version 1.6 2013-08-26 1
You have to remember honors number each time you log in. Menu is very confusing.
Version 1.6 2013-08-26 2
It works but I love to keep changing my phones every couple of weeks and this app is not universal on all platforms. They need to release this app on more platforms like Windows Phone 8 and possibly BB10 and then it will be true 5 stars.
Version 1.6 2013-08-19 3
The remember me box when checked does not save your Hilton honors number.  Every time I log in, I have to re-enter my honors number. As a person who travels( diamond) often and uses the app frequently it is a pain to always need to log in
Version 1.6 2013-08-15 2
Very annoying and makes the app much less useless, would be 10x more useful if it saved your account info.
Version 1.6 2013-08-14 1
I wanted to make a reservation but Hilton can't remember my 9 digit membership number or my 4 digit password. I can't remember them either, so I booked at a Crowne Plaza.  Lucky for me the IHG app actually works.
Version 1.6 2013-08-09 2
Time to support the option of add the Hilton Honors membership card to passbook, in that way people don't need to be carrying it in the wallet.
Version 1.6 2013-08-07 1
I agree. This app is totally useless. Wake up Hilton!!!
Version 1.6 2013-07-30 3
I am a loyal platinum guest.  This is improved and would also like an update to the save login bug which broke after the last update!
Version 1.6 2013-07-30 1
It's a good thing for Hilton their hotels are not judged by their App. This app is amateur at best.  Extremely limited functionality, color scheme is atrocious - urgent messages show uvin white text on a bright yellow background - hence unreadable.  E-checking fails 99% of the time.  Additional amenities takes you to a page where nothing exists and graciously tells you so.  Room pics just plain kicks you out of the App.  Signing in never remembers your details even though I check the box marked Remember Me each time.  To summarize, complete garbage.  C'mon Hilton. How much does it cost to develop an app that represents the brand name???
Version 1.6 2013-07-26 1
Fix the stay signed in option
Version 1.6 2013-07-23 3
PLEASE correct the remember me option. It doesn't work like it used to. Please make it actually remember!!!
Version 1.6 2013-07-14 2
It's nice that you can search for Hilton family hotels, but the app no longer remembers your sign-in information even when you check "Remember Me." What's the point of a HiltonHonors app if it doesn't recognize who I am? It's easier to use Worldmate to save my travel reservations.
Version 1.6 2013-07-10 1
If I could give it a negative 5 stars I would! To many issues to list, better off going to the website.
Version 1.6 2013-07-09 2
How about an iPAD version?  With some usable functionality,but better than the web site?
Version 1.6 2013-07-07 1
It doesn't look like this app is anything except for a web site and a wrapper. And it's unclear why they have so many apps, and don't update them. Hilton should just stick with the HHonors app.
Version 1.6 2013-07-01 3
Really, not great.  But the purpose is about the Hilton Hotels brand.

If you want a Hilton Honors App, use the Hilton Honors App.  I'll be deleting the app and using the other one exclusively.
Version 1.6 2013-06-29 2
Please fix the remember me function!!!!
Version 1.6 2013-06-24 1
Upgraded recently. No additional benefits and it doesn't remember your honors number...even when you check the box. Huge disappointment and wish I didn't upgrade. Last version was better.
Version 1.6 2013-06-21 1
Very annoyed that this version doesn't remember your login info even though there is a check box for it!
Version 1.6 2013-06-17 2
No good if it doesn't actually remember my Hhonors number. I can't use this app if I have to look it up all the time.
Version 1.6 2013-06-14 3
As a loyal HH member and frequent traveler, I like having this app on my phone. The one major problem is the "remember me" function doesn't work. It's a huge pain to have to constantly log in, especially as it requires you to use the HH number as the username, which isn't easy to remember. I have a passcode on my phone so I can leave apps logged in. Please fix this frustrating bug!
Version 1.6 2013-06-05 1
They should look at what Delta and American have done for their apps and use that for inspiration for a hotel app.  This thing is bad.
Version 1.6 2013-06-01 1
I don't like this version, please fix the retention on the HH number when you check the box for remember me....
Version 1.6 2013-05-31 3
"Remember me" doesn't work. Please fix.
Version 1.6 2013-05-30 1
This is by far the worst hotel app I have come across in terms if functionality and UI. Hilton needs to use Priority Club and Starwood as what a hotel app should be. The recent updates are noticeable but they are still lacking. Just like their hotel brands this app is outdated, tired and falling way behind the competition.
Version 1.6 2013-05-24 2
The login does not remember your acct#. So annoying!!  I can't remember it, so I always have to go through old emails to track down my acct info.  Please fix the "remember me" login feature.
Version 1.6 2013-05-18 1
As a diamond member and seeing some of the best hilton has to offer this app is lacking. This app needs huge improvements including:
*Multitasking ability
*Complete list of general contact numbers 
*mobile check out
*an iPhone friendly layout for photos and tours of hotels
Version 1.6 2013-05-09 1
Now that Hilton has released the HHonors app, there's no need for this one.....deleted
Version 1.6 2013-05-06 1
Doesn't remember my honors info. Last version was just better in several ways. Don't update if possible
Version 1.6 2013-05-05 3
Improvements to the echeck-in, but now the text blends into the background when selecting a room.  This is unacceptable!  Who developed this so foolishly.  I like other features that have been added.  The search for hotels has been improved.  Still a work in progress.  -Diamond Member
Version 1.6 2013-05-05 1
Mostly terrible native wrapper on a HTML site. This app is a case study for why not to do hybrid apps.
Version 1.6 2013-05-04 1
Useless
Version 1.6 2013-05-04 4
Much improved app for making reservations.
Version 1.6 2013-05-04 1
The "remember" function does not work for Hilton Honors info in login after latest upgrade , meaning you have to remember & re type account info each type - small detail but very frustrating !!
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-30 1
I stay in hotels usually 4 nights a week, usually at hilton hotels. This app needs some work. Find hotels near me has never worked on either of my phones. I don't always know surrounding cities, towns, or suburbs. So the app that should be helpful, really is not and have better luck using the Internet. This app usually just makes me want to stay at other hotels.
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-28 1
I looked up a hotel on this app and then on the website on my laptop.  The price for the exact room was cheaper on the website than this app.  Very odd.
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-27 2
Diamond member getting more&more tired of Hilton. App stinks!! but so does website so shouldn't be surprised.
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-24 2
I utilized the app before today and it worked fine... But I can't even log into my HHonors account without it just crashing. Please fix this bug ASAP! Then I will re rate it 5stars... Thank you from a Loyal HHonors Member!
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-20 1
I am a very loyal Diamond level HHonors Hilton customer. The app needs a lot of work. Each time you use it you have to re-enter your corporate ID, if you have one. You have to re-enter your search preferences each and every time (eg if you search for rates based on AAA membership, etc.) Worst of all, and the main reason I am no longer using the app, you cannot leave a personal message for the hotel you are checking in to. I almost always need to leave a message and this app does not even have a field for such a message (much less give the user a chance to store a few commonly used messages for re-use). 

Come on guys. 

May I respectfully suggest you work on improving this app? How about some benchmarking and comparing to your competitor's apps as a starting point. Give us at least what they do - then shoot for added value beyond that minimally required basic feature set. 

Ya, I am frustrated. A million loyalty points and I don't have a decent app to use to book my next stay. 

:-(
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-18 1
SPG app is a lot better than this one. It's more beautiful, convenient and can even track my membership with passbook. Hilton has a long way to go. Hurry, Hilton!
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-15 1
Yes. A disaster
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-14 1
This app is terrible Muriel. I would be a diamond member by now, but every other major hotel chain has a far better app for last minute bookings. Hilton would be better to just not have an app at all.
Version 1.0 2013-04-12 3
This app still doesn't work with Apple's Passbook service? Weak.
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-11 1
I have been a diamond member for years and top tier at SPG. Hilton should take a look at SPG app - easy to make, modify and cancel reservations and provides my account info. Hilton App is a long way off ---zero stars if they allowed it.
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-08 1
Just horrible!!! Can't even view some of the essential buttons, no iPhone 5 screen support, you have to sign in every time - even with "remember me," and you have to fully close it and relaunch it every 15 min when your login session expires!
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-08 3
Hilton should add iPhone 5 screen support, more freedom to manage your hhonors account and consolidate all Hilton brands into one app. Currently, all the separate apps are basically copies. One should only need one app to search them all.
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-08 2
Poor design. No UX expectations were met. I can barely navigate the kludgey app. The lack of options to achieve authentication make it difficult to use the app for people that can not recall their pin. A reset option, or challenge them with other info is preferable. Overall no the worst app of the day, but far from the best.
Version 1.5.10 2013-04-02 1
Update your app, too many crashes because it's old version and never updated. We need full screen for iPhone 5 too 😡
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-25 5
Its simple to use
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-24 1
There is no way if you've forgotten your password to be able to recover it from the app.  Very frustrating.
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-19 2
The booking calendar really should be a proper calendar, rather than a scrolling list of numbers. I really need to see the days of the week included, please. Also, the light blue color scheme seems a bit cheap looking.  Hilton should have a much more updated, top-end look to the app.
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-17 5
I read so many bad reviews of this app that I thought I would never download it. Thankfully I saw a few positive reviews from hhonor members - and decided to see what it was all about. This app is great - it linked perfectly to my diamond account, I could search and book rooms, had my current points, and it showed upcoming and past reservations. So what's all the negativity about? Sabotage! This app is fine!
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-17 1
I'm not one to write reviews, but I'm writing in hopes that the app creator would made a simple adjustment. They did not leave enough space at the bottom of each page. As a result, it is almost impossible to push the "submit" button. It's very frustrating to go through all the questions and prompts not to be able to submit changing, information, etc. I should mention that after multiple attempts I was able to add an additional night to the reservation, but it took a lot longer than it should have. I was temped to quit trying and call the 800 number.
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-15 1
This is my first review. I felt compelled to give feedback for this awful app. When I read the reviews, I was skeptical that an app could be this bad. The reviews were completely right. Hilton needs to rethink their mobile strategy, or they will find themselves behind their competition.
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-14 1
Please add where you can search for dining with the rewards card And places to use reward points
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-14 1
This app is not worth downloading. Better yet, they should pay you for wasting storage downloading it. Whoever made this app should be fired. Spg app is much better, easier, and user friendly.
Version 1.5.8 2013-03-12 1
I agree with the other reviews.  This app does not reflect the prestige of the Hilton name.  I can use this to view my current reservations for an address and that is it. This really needs a modern update and integration to HHonors.  The hilton website, hhonors website and emailed confirmation are all very nice.  This app seemed like a prototype.
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-10 1
Hilton desperately needs to have a quick look at the mobile application. competitive landscape and see how they compare.  I hope they would come to the same conclusion as the rest of these reviews.  I simply do not know if it is ego or ignorance on the development of their application.  

As a diamond member Hilton please get your act together on the mobile application front.
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-04 1
This app is an embarrassment to Hilton.  It would have great on blackberry circa 2005 but I am at a loss to imagine how one of the world's largest upscale hotel chains can offer an app that actually has less functionality than the mobile site. Periodically I check back in the hope they have developed an app that compares to Starwood or IHG, but all that seems to be on the roadmap are minor big fixes. Until this app is completely refreshed, you're better off bookmarking the mobile site or browsing with Expedia.
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-03 1
Seriously, this app is useless. There is absolutely no value proposition to use it. It is so basic and almost offensive, I mean I downloaded this junk...
Version 1.5.10 2013-03-02 3
It could do pretty basic things but Hilton needs to show it is up to date with technology and put more effort on their mobile strategy … come on.

Needs to be optimized for iPhone 5 and then you need to be able to send your ID card with status to Passbook.  Ugh … like SPG
Version 1.5.10 2013-02-26 1
It really feels like a mobile site from a few years ago. Marriott's app is much better.
Version 1.5.10 2013-02-25 1
As others have said, this app is worthless.  Merely a wrapper (and a poor one at that) for their mobile site.  No iPhone 5 support.  Poor scrolling/truncating.  No access to account info.  The Starwood app is literally 1000x better than this piece of garbage.
Version 1.5.10 2013-02-24 2
The sorts when the the results are shown do not work.  Tried to sort by price and it did not do anything.  Also it does not show all the hotels, tried same search on the website on my PC and got more hotels in that search.
Version 1.5.10 2013-02-23 1
...in having a hotel app that doesn't like to Loyalty membership?

I downloaded thinking I'd have access to my points and instead got an app that is worse than any hotel app out there!!! Priority, SPG, Marriott, Hyatt - even NH all have membership imbedded in their apps. Why bother with an app like this? I'd rather use Hotels.com if I want a generic hotel site!

What a waste of time and effort creating this app!
Version 1.5.10 2013-02-20 1
Boy. some people just hate this app.  And i don't get the frustration over this app. Hilton App works fine and shows all the Hilton Family of hotels by location, price, HHONORS points.  Download the Hilton app and you get  Hampton, Embassy Suites, Double Tree, etc.  Easy to use for this Diamond Member. If there is one problem with the app, I wish it showed more pictures of hotel properties (like photos of swimming pool, lobby, bar, grounds, rooms, etc). Other than that, the app is  easy to use and navigate.
Version 1.5.10 2013-02-20 1
Update months after a phones release and we're still stuck with a hotel app that's leap years behind everyone else. Keep up the good work.
Version 1.5.10 2013-02-20 1
This app is really bad.  Search for a hotel near me, it shows my city.  However, when I continue my search, it gives me a list of my city name in every state, and I have to choose my state.  If you can figure out my city, you should be able to figure out my state.  Why?!?
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-17 1
No words to describe how basic, and useless this app is. Tech team needs to step up if they want to compete with the other chains. No access to review stays or points history. This is not hard guys...step it up.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-17 1
Just an awful, clunky app that does not work well. Nor does it work on the iPhone 5 with much efficacy. Get your act together and release a real app. Not just a website wrapper.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-16 2
I have lots of rewards to use and can't search hotels by amenities. I promised the wife a relaxing anniversary weekend  and promised a whirlpool tub in the room but this app doesn't allow me to search by amenities. Sure could be better.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-15 5
I have no idea where all the negative reviews are coming from. This works like a charm on my iPhone5. I've got 8 reservations made and have been able to manage them with ease. Even booked a London Waldorf property using points. Perhaps it's been worked on or maybe the iPhone5 and iOS 6 are more compatible. I suggest you give it another shot if you've had issues. If you don't like it well; apps are easy enough to delete:)
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-15 1
What a terribble app for Hilton to utilize
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-14 3
It is an okay app, but not as good as others. However, the search filters are broken in the latest version so I recommend not upgrading. I like to search on Distance among all brands but even if you select Distance it still sorts by brand always. It would be great if the would roll back a couple versions so I could use filter selection again.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-13 1
If I could go lower than 1 star, I would.  Take a cue from SPG, Hilton.  Look at your calendar…it is 2013.  Poorly adapted mobile website will not cut it.  Spend some money and make an app that reflects the quality of your hotel brand.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-13 1
If you use this app to make a reservation, it is considered a pre-paid reservation and you can't change your reservation. If you change your reservation, you are charged a $25 fee. If you cancel, your credit card is charged the full amount of your reservation. This is very sad and disappointing coming from a company like Hilton. I've always been very happy with their customer service, but after this episode, I'll be staying with a different, more accommodating hotel in the future.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-11 1
Terrible site. I cannot scroll down to the bottom of the page to change a reservation. This site is the worst!!!
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-09 3
I cannot scroll to the bottom of the page!!! To have a function to manage reservations is great! But there's a bug where I can't get to the bottom of the page to click the update button!!! Please fix this. This is such a silly issue.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-07 1
A room booked directly from their site cannot be managed from this app.  Makes no sense.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-06 1
I have had this app since 2009 and have yet to see it improved to make it really worthwhile. How can one of the world's largest and most prestigious hotel chains still not have an iPad app? Every now and then I check on that App Store but one still doesn't exist. It's 2013, folks! 

Also, I try to sort by points or distance and it consistently sorts by brand. Plus, to really get information, I still have to go the main website. 

I see other Hilton apps have good ratings yet fail to understand why I need a separate app for each Hilton brand, when the flagship app should cover them all in a manner that reflects the corporate branding.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-04 1
App is useless junk. Hilton should be embarrassed that, in a world where most of their best clients conduct business primarily via handheld devices, there is no reliable way to efficiently make and manage reservations remotely. The "cancel reservation" function does appear to work, however, which is exactly what I just did.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-03 1
No passbook integration. Signed into my Hilton Honors acct and it said I have no reservations currently, even though I do. So I entered the confirmation number and it came up. It didn't save the reservation at all, so when I went back to my acct and asked to show my reservations it came up blank again. Very sad.
Version 1.5.8 2013-02-03 1
All I ever get is a message saying they are experiencing technical difficulties and can't access my account. They need to experience a fix for this app!! Marriott's app on the other hand is always working well.
Version 1.5.2 2013-02-01 1
Little use outside the USA. No capacity to see history. Keeps asking for login. Urgent overhaul needed. Hilton lift your game ! It's embarrassing its so bad
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-30 1
A poor app that refuses to get better, very clunky. Also, why isn't there an iPad version? I'd consider Hilton properties more if this was improved
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-29 1
That is all I can say with how bad this app is. Find hotel near me did nothing. The window does not fit the iPhone 5 right and no passbook integration.
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-28 1
The way I think this is worst app for a big brand ever
Version 1.0 2013-01-27 1
Hilton is my preferred brand, but this (and the apps of Hilton's sister brands) are pathetic. In addition to the overall shoddy design:
- Separate apps for each brand.
- No Passbook integration for HHonors members.
- No support for either the iPhone 5 or retina screens.
Dear Hilton: download Starwood's SPG app and use that as a reference on what a well designed hotel app should be. That is all.
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-25 1
Yep.  It's is awful as everyone says.  No iPad version and the iPhone version doesn't even work right.  A search for hotels near me shows up sorted by brand and the sort option doesn't work at all.  This is a major turnoff to the Hilton brand.  Guess I need to look at some other chains.
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-19 1
You can not be serious. This is Hilton not Super8. Put some money into the development of a decent app. Too many shortcomings to list.
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-17 1
One of the better hotel chains with a pitiful app. I want passbook support and full functionality!
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-15 1
This is basically a generic mobile site not a app. Come on hilton!
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-13 2
This app doesn't offer much to Hilton Honors members. It is little more than a utility to see hotels in a certain city.  Could be a lot more powerful customer engagement tool if it incorporated more functionality and allowed you to access more Hilton Honors information, functionality and tools.
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-12 1
App needs a major upgrade.  Very little functionality.
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-12 2
While the Hilton app can get the job done in a pinch, it's far from a delightful experience.
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-12 4
Not real sure why so many complaints. Everything you need is available.  It just like signing into the web site as far as I can see.
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-09 1
Where is the passbook integration?  SPG has it, Hilton is behind!
Version 1.5.8 2013-01-03 1
I would expect Hilton to be leading the pack when it comes to hotel apps. They are in last place. Doesn't show my rewards history. Location searching didn't work. Even though it found my location correctly it only showed hotels in Washington, D.C.  1500 miles away from me.
Version 1.5.2 2013-01-03 1
This app is ridiculously ineffective. You waste more time waiting for it do its job than if you just jumped on the website Also the lack of iPad support is laughable. C'mon Hilton. Listen to us.
Version 1.5.8 2012-12-26 2
It is amazing that the "Priority Club" for Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza, etc. has such good apps for the iPhone and iPad, but the Hilton's is so horrible. Plus they don't have a specialized app for the iPad. I figured for how much you pay to stay at a Hilton, they could at least make a good app to book through. This app makes me want to stay with the IHG Group just because the apps for them are so much better. Please step it up Hilton. This is pretty disappointing!
Version 1.5.8 2012-12-22 1
This app is just not very good and on an iPhone 5 it is still displayed in the size of an iPhone 4.  It co scantly shuts down to the point where I actually use the standard website on my browser to actually navigate the Hilton site.  Just not very good at all!
Version 1.5.8 2012-12-20 1
... to the Hilton brand. Please throw this away and start from scratch, and this time build a native app, not a wrapper of your poor mobile site.
Version 1.5.8 2012-12-19 1
This is a crappy mobile website. Take note from Starwood and write a real app.
Version 1.5.8 2012-12-08 1
Just compare to the Apps for SPG, Hyatt, Marriott...  We even booked more with those brands.
Version 1.5.2 2012-12-07 1
As a Hilton Honors member I would think that you could log in and stay logged in, check your reservations, awards portfolio, etc. Poor interface! Please put some time into developing this app for people like myself who travel and depend on our smartphones to get us to our destinations!
Version 1.5.8 2012-12-06 1
Poor UI, really lacks in design and usability.  From a multi-billion $ brand, I would expect an outstanding app and superior app design.  I'm not a developer, so I don't know why it entails, but this app looks like it was developed by a grade school computer class.  Take a look at the SPG app and do better.  Just another reason why I dislike the Hilton brand overall...I'm only shlubbing it at Hilton right now to get Gold and free Internet when I "have" to stay at Hilton's.
Version 1.3 2012-12-05 1
I am an avid Hilton honors customer. But this app is a total joke! Hilton needs to look at typical competitors in the travel app space an improve this product.
Version 1.5.2 2012-12-05 2
Two stars for meeting the basic requirements....works ok and does what it says. But this app sure doesn't go any further! Ugly, feature poor, and slow to log in. No saved password. Little account info. Update it!
Version 1.5.8 2012-12-04 1
bad design. it does not look like hilton.
Version 1.5.2 2012-12-03 1
This is a very disappointing app, with very few features. Hardly useful at all for anyone who wants to use the Hilton chain.
Version 1.5.8 2012-12-03 1
Been a Diamond member for 10 years.

What a pile. 5 apps for 5 different Hilton brands.  Why???

And why on earth does my AAA # not stick??

Big enhancements to the Dec 3 release. Glad you took advantage of Passbook and iPhone 5 screen. 

Another failure on Hilton's IT dept.  Way to go.
Version 1.5.2 2012-12-01 2
Hilton, I love your brand and I am a Gold member so I stay at a Hilton as much as I can. I just feel that this app could do a lot more. I am also a Starwood Preferred Guest and they just released an awesome new app. What I like about it is it is very integrated for my account info. Tells me about my stays/nights/ reward level. How many to the next level. AND it has all of that on Passbook now. Super awesome. I would love for Hilton to redesign there app so that I don't ever have to log onto the site. Like store my fav hotels, allow me to register for MyWay specials, how about push notifications when a new special is out to register. Request a new card from app. See everything about my status( YTD stays, YTD nights, how many to the next level) and finally passbook integration for my gold card would be awesome. Well I hope this helps and looming forward to a new app if its coming.
Version 1.5.2 2012-12-01 1
This is pathetic! Quite frustrating that Hilton doesn't care enough to serve customers well in this digital age and create a good experience! 

Can't even store Hilton login info in the app. 

Someone at Hilton headquarters should take note of their pathetic ratings on this app and put a small amount of cash into a good mobile app. Sad!
Version 1.5.2 2012-11-29 1
This application is a glorified web browser that won't even remember your Hilton Honors number. Need one app for all the properties not a per-brand set of web apps packaged.
Version 1.5.2 2012-11-26 1
I am expecting more from Hilton.
Version 1.5.2 2012-11-24 1
You'd think Hilton would do something.  It rarely works and won't allow you to make a reservation or much of anything else.  If you're lucky you can see hotels you'd like to stay at but good luck making a reservation.
Version 1.5.2 2012-11-12 1
This is a shameful product from a company usually associated with quality. I suggest you not only look at the capabilities of similar apps from your competition, but look back at the reviews of previous versions of this app. Either you have really dropped the ball with updates or been left in the technological dust by your competition, or both. Either way, this is as useless as a football bat.   Please demonstrate that you do, in fact, value the expectations of your customers and fix it.
Version 1.5.2 2012-11-04 1
Basically repackaged mobile website. With so much potential this app is just embarrassing.
Version 1.5.2 2012-10-17 2
Not well designed, but it gets the job done. The buggiest thing I found was the gps search. It looks up the city name but doesn't include the state, so it gives a list of other cities with the same name in other states. D'oh!
Version 1.5.2 2012-10-17 1
Doesn't seem to remember Honors number and provides little else. You can search for a hotel but nothing special or unique about this app. Disappointing.
Version 1.5.2 2012-10-15 1
Why so little paid to your employee to keep the Hilton App accessible.

Request employee work over time and through the weekend to get this app and web site fix.  

Customers unable to book reservations.   
Hilton competitors pay their employee so there app works along with their web site.  

Let get this problem resolved. Thanks.
Version 1.5.2 2012-10-11 1
I just deleted this app from my iPhone it's one of the worst I've ever used and is very surprising coming from a company like Hilton. 

I'm a diamond member in their Hilton honors Program and I was unable to access reservations, make reservations or find accurate information with regard to properties near my location, in fact many were missing that I knew existed. 

Update this app it make it user-friendly.  I would really enjoy it being on the road as much as I am. Thank you very much.
Version 1.5.2 2012-10-10 1
It's surprising how bad this app is.
Version 1.5.2 2012-10-08 1
I was really expecting a lot more from Hilton.
Version 1.5.2 2012-10-06 2
The app covers the basics but it doesn't compare to Marriott's. Its a serviceable app, but it doesn't have the bells and whistle.
Version 1.5.2 2012-10-03 2
Would be nice to be able to make special requests, view upgrade opportunities...
Version 1.5.2 2012-09-27 1
I am a loyal Hilton guy; but this app is terrible. If I wanted a mobile site- I'd go to your site. The competition is pretty far ahead here already. Please update.
Version 1.5.2 2012-09-20 1
Go look at priorityclubs app ( holiday inn) and copy their app. It's so easy to use I book with them first and only through the Hilton app if necessary.
Version 1.5.2 2012-09-19 1
Constant login, won't find reservations even with the conf number. Doesn't work period. Don't waste your time.
Version 1.5.2 2012-09-17 1
I can only see how many honors points I have and search for hotels...when did this app get so bad?
Version 1.3 2012-09-10 1
Clearly Hilton needs to work on delivering a much better app.  Both Marriott and SPG's apps are way more user-friendly and advance.  Any updates soon??
Version 1.5.2 2012-09-05 1
I wanted to extend the length of a reservation.  The app wanted me to click "change" before showing me the new price, so I canceled the change and quit the app instead.  Not sure yet if I'll try to rebook with Hilton or switch to a hotel with a better app.
Version 1.5.2 2012-09-02 1
Apparently I never need to know anything about my account. Upcoming stays, check. No other info, check. Waste of my time, check. 

Hilton developers:  copy SPG
Version 1.5.2 2012-08-31 1
Really.  This app is worthless.
Version 1.5.2 2012-08-29 1
Can't really do anything with HHonors account. Not even seeing existing reservations.
Version 1.5.2 2012-08-24 1
I almost exclusively stay at Hilton Hotels when I travel. I can't believe this is what they put together for an app. Too many problems to list!
Version 1.5.2 2012-08-22 2
Have to constantly login. Hit the back button & it does not even remember the location.
Version 1.5.2 2012-08-21 1
App used to be ok, but recent upgrade makes it worthless. Have to login each time, can't search and book new hotels, etc. 

The App should remember my login info and easily pull up my reservations. Why do I need the confirmation number to view my reservations? Check out the Marriott app.
Version 1.5.2 2012-08-19 1
Continuous log in. No map view. Couldn't book through app.  Went to different hotel.  Hilton, take a look at marriott's app for ideas.
Version 1.5.2 2012-08-16 1
I only installed the app to be able to look up my hhonors account balance.  
There appears to be no such feature.
Version 1.5.2 2012-08-13 2
Can't really do anything with this app. Only give it 2 stars because it at least allows you to look up your reservation and open up its address in the navigation view. Other than that, not useful at all and makes you log in every single screen.
Version 1.5.2 2012-08-06 1
Use to be a good and productive app... Now it is a mess, always having to login  and when canceling a Rez... Forget it.
Version 1.5 2012-07-31 1
Can't see honors activity, have to log in every time the screen changes. I use several different travel apps and this is the very worst one.
Version 1.5 2012-07-27 1
I am very disappointed in this app. Hard to use, slow, and have to keep entering my password to do anything. I expected a much better product from Hilton. Other brands have a much easier, user friendly app. I use Holiday Inn's a lot now.
Version 1.5 2012-07-25 1
I travel for business and I stay almost exclusively at a Hilton brand hotel. I expected a quality app to help me find hotels and check reservations easily. This is a seriously poor app even for iPhones. From Hilton I would expect a robust and quality iPad app to be available. I am very disappointed. Other brands offer a much better  app experience and easier to use. I may re-think my hotel brand.
Version 1.3 2012-07-24 1
I would expect much better from the Hilton brand name.
Version 1.4 2012-07-19 1
I'm a hhonors diamond member and I'd rather sleep on the street than use this app. Seriously Hilton? This app is essentially useless, and your website is abysmal. Good thing you have nice hotels or I'd bail on this amateur hour in a heartbeat.
Version 1.5 2012-07-19 1
"remember me" doesn't work - you have to type in login info every time you use the freaking thing.  Account info available when you do get logged in us very minimal.  Useless until they fix.
Version 1.5 2012-07-18 1
I really hope Hilton IT reads these reviews and responds. We need one Hilton app for all brands and make it functional and work for your customers.

I stay at a Hilton property about once a week and am thinking of going to Marriott as their tools are designed well and make it easy for me, not harder.

This is really embarrassing for Hilton.
Version 1.5 2012-07-17 1
A terrible app that should have never been released.
Version 1.5 2012-07-16 1
App is absolutely terrible and a poor reflection on Hilton. There is a very limited number of features available on the app and those that are built-in, such as online check-in rarely ever work. Interface is awkward and looks as though it was designed in the late 1980s
Version 1.5 2012-07-14 1
Nothing is as it states. Took off my phone within 2 minutes
Version 1.3 2012-07-12 1
This app is worthless. As much loyalty as hhonors members give to Hilton, you would think something a simple as a decent app would be a no brainier. Come on guys.
Version 1.5 2012-07-11 1
Poor App., but I'm not surprised. The website has never gotten to the level it needs to be at either. Whoever in charge of technology should be canned....something as basic as the ability to email a reservation can not be done in this App...Hilton, come on.....
Version 1.5 2012-07-02 1
Don't bother wasting the space on your phone with this app... By far the worst hotel/travel app out there. Especially for hhonors members. They really need to make this more friendly for those of us who travel and want to check on our last few stays being credited, status, balance, requests for future reservations etc. too bad you have to give them a star at all, otherwise it would be 0 from me....
Version 1.5 2012-07-01 1
As a gold hhonors member, this is one the worst apps ever. Basic stuff: member information, search based on current location, single login...
Really guys, can you not afford to make this a decent app?
Version 1.5 2012-06-28 1
Didn't work for my regular search on my iphone. Please update. Thanks
Version 1.5 2012-06-27 1
No information on honors....   Really ?
Version 1.5 2012-06-25 1
Almost useless The user should be able to see search results by distance not by brand
Version 1.5 2012-06-24 1
App logged me out every time I looked at a different hotel. It also doesn't find the reservation I just made and doesn't remember me even though I checked "remember me".
Version 1.5 2012-06-24 1
After using starwoods app, this looks like a joke.
Version 1.4 2012-06-19 1
even a simple hotel phone# link gives
me an error url cant be shown??? its a phone number!!!!!

had to end up calling, what a waste of time
Version 1.5 2012-06-15 1
As a loyal Hilton honors man, this is the worst excuse for an app ever and provides zero value as a member.  Jumping to screens and issues creates havoc and the worse part is the mobile website for Hilton is even worse!  I'd rather boot my old PC and wait than try to find value here.  What an embarrassment for such a great company.
Version 1.5 2012-06-15 5
Makes it easy to log into my HHonors account and see upcoming reservations, rather than always having to sift through emails. Also helpful when I need to make a booking while traveling.
Version 1.3 2012-06-14 1
This really is as bad as others have written -- it made me feel embarrassed for Hilton. No help at all in managing my reservations or points balance. The chain needs a grown-up app, now.
Version 1.4 2012-06-11 1
This is the worst app from a major corporation I've ever seen. There needs to be a no star star for this thing.  Don't waste your time.
Version 1.4 2012-06-10 1
I saw a quote in Fortune about the benefits of hotel apps for busy travelers.  He must stay at Marriott this app is almost useless.
Version 1.4 2012-06-09 1
Hope they didn't pay someone to create this nearly useless app....
Version 1.4 2012-06-07 1
Wow, I downloaded to see it for myself, and it was bad. The layout and interface was awkward and picture selection and quality is low. The HHonor page gas limited info. IT IS the worst hotel app I have seen so far.....
Version 1.4 2012-06-07 1
They just need to look at Hyatt or Starwood to see where to improve
Version 1.4 2012-06-07 1
Too many bugs with the app. Cannot book a room through the app. Waste of time trying different options.
Version 1.4 2012-06-05 1
Has to be the lowest rated app ever.  Is this a joke?
Version 1.4 2012-06-03 1
Horrible app... What a waste... Can't believe Hilton is willing to put their name to it.  Even some motel's apps are better.  And yes, I am a diamond HH.
Version 1.4 2012-06-03 1
Wow! How does such a massive hotel chain have such a terrible app? It is not at all user friendly and gives you almost no information. Seriously, if the Hilton staff is reading any of these reviews please take a look at the SPG (Starwood) app. They got it right with their latest update.
Version 1.4 2012-05-30 1
It is clear that  Hilton Worldwide CIO Robert Webb has no clue. Fire him and get someone who gives a darn.
Version 1.4 2012-05-27 1
I think the hourly motel down the street would have a better app.
Version 1.4 2012-05-27 1
If you just want basic information, this App is for you. Google or Yahoo would be much quicker.
Version 1.4 2012-05-22 1
This app has been better in the past. The previous version actually worked.

This version does not keep stored credentials, GUI looks horrible, historic doesn't work.

What happened?!? Very disappointing for someone that is an active Hilton Honors member.
Version 1.4 2012-05-22 1
App doesn't work!
Version 1.4 2012-05-21 1
Really Hilton? This app bites! As a Gold member on the road, I want an app to quickly access the Hilton Family hotels. This app has never worked well from the start. Can't log in, can't connect, errors out and now here I sit in an airport needing a room for 10 days and can't get the app to work!  Pull it and fix it today plz.
Version 1.4 2012-05-21 1
I can't believe this app! 
If I worked there, I would be ashamed of this. I did simple searches, ended up typing in "Traverse City, MI" about 10 times because the search engine didn't repopulate the info. 
This is so bad- it would be better for Hilton's reputation to stop offering this app until it can be redone, than to keep offering a sub-par app to potential guests who only get frustrated. 
Next time, test the app with focus groups before you put it on the market! 
As a HHonors Gold member, I am still loyal to the chain, but what a huge disappointment this was. Take time to withdraw and regroup, Hilton people!
Version 1.4 2012-05-17 1
I am switching hotel family. I just can't believe that a company can't make the effort to have a good website or app. When they already took the time and money to build one.
Version 1.4 2012-05-16 1
So the first button I pressed (sign on) resulted in an unhandled exception and the app blew up.
Version 1.4 2012-05-14 1
Just tried to use for the first time. Awful !  Would not complete anything. Technical difficulties....  Really. !!  Come on Hilton.
Version 1.4 2012-05-14 1
You can sign in on your HHonors acct and look up your point balance, see pending reservations, see hotels near your GPS location and book them, that's about all. It's nothing more than a brand app presence.
Version 1.4 2012-05-13 1
I try to use the app and can never see what I need. End up just going to their full website 9 times out of 10.
Version 1.4 2012-05-13 1
one word...UNINSTALL!
Version 1.4 2012-05-12 1
This app is basically worthless. You can't get all of your HHonors info.
Version 1.4 2012-05-12 2
I'm a frequent traveler and I rely on my apps to keep me going.  I love Hilton because there are hotels everywhere I need to be but this app does nothing to help me.  It needs a lot more polish and features.  The SPG app makes this one look like it was written in BASIC by some kid in elementary school.  I'll continue to stay at Hilton but I'll never book a stay or even find a hotel with this app.
Version 1.4 2012-05-09 1
I didn't think it could be as bad as everyone said so I figured I'd give it a shot. Nope, everyone is right, this app is garbage.
Version 1.4 2012-05-09 1
This app has been experiencing problems, particularly with Hilton honors accounts for the past week. Useless app.
Version 1.4 2012-05-09 1
Useless app. Removed from my iPhone. Boo, Hilton! I'm very disappointed. Take a look at Marriott's!
Version 1.4 2012-05-07 1
Not even good as a 1.0 release. Can't do anything on it.  Can't see past activity.
Version 1.3 2012-05-04 1
I'll like to give zero stars but is impossible this app is a pice of 💩 common guy is HILTON you should do better than that any advice email me I can help you guys at least to see if before 2020 you get 5 star as a rate
Version 1.4 2012-05-03 2
Updates don't make app better. An iPad version would be nice too!!!
Version 1.4 2012-05-01 1
Apparently everyone agrees...except Marriott.
Version 1.4 2012-04-27 1
As a Diamond member I'm very disappointed in this app - its essentially useless.
Version 1.4 2012-04-24 1
This app literally has never worked.  What's the point of being a diamond member?  I like to book online, or on apps, but this is really embarrassing for Hilton.  I'm actually considering a change . . . and not just away from the app!
Version 1.4 2012-04-24 1
Does essentially nothing.
Version 1.4 2012-04-19 1
Is this for real??? Come on Hilton!
Version 1.4 2012-04-18 1
This app should be withdrawn from the store. It is that bad. Punt and regroup.
Version 1.4 2012-04-18 1
can even worse? what a shame app!
Version 1.4 2012-04-17 1
This app is so bad, it's really an insult to the Hilton brand.  Marriot's app is so much more useful and functional. Fix this app for your loyal members, Hilton!!
Version 1.4 2012-04-16 1
You are better off searching this on the web. This app needs some serious work fast!! HILTON WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET A CLUE YOU NEED TO FIX THIS TERRIBLE APP!!!!!
Version 1.4 2012-04-16 1
This app is actually impressively bad. Once you log in, only says "no cancelled reservations", but does not show upcoming reservations?  Really?  Locate hotels near me pulls up hotels 25 miles away but not the Hilton O'Hare here at the airport?  Am I on television?
Version 1.4 2012-04-10 1
I cannot believe the low quality of this app. It truly is so far from being effective and you are better off just using the web-site. 

Hilton, need to go back to the drawing board and make an app that is actually useful.
Version 1.4 2012-04-08 1
Kids are making better apps than this. I'm surprised Hilton has its name on something as crappy as this.
Version 1.4 2012-04-07 1
1. Maps - nope
2. Search by hotel brand - not yet - really? REALLY?? 
3. Remembers ID - not yet
4. Needs work - FAST.
Version 1.4 2012-04-06 1
See Kayak and do it right.
Version 1.4 2012-04-05 1
A child could create a better app than this. What a waste of time (by me for downloading this) and money (by Hilton for spending $ on this).
Version 1.4 2012-04-01 1
Doesn't remember your HH login, so unless you look it up every time or have it memorized, you can't even check your points. 

One of the least user friendly apps I've seen on the iPhone... and then they duplicated their mess across all their brands.
Version 1.4 2012-04-01 1
Your app for Hilton it not really compatible with the IPad. It does not rotate!
Very amateurish job on this app, I go to the web site to make reservations because it's so bad!
Version 1.4 2012-04-01 2
Decent app. Not what it used to be, though. I wish I could look at a map to select a nearby hotel (near a specific city, but also specifically ON my primary route) while road tripping with the family. The map should feature links to basic hotel info - star rating, and prices (either USD or points, whichever I selected in my search) rather than needing to toggle back and forth between this an the maps app.  I also want to read reviews of the hotel before I book a room.  This app basically turned into the same app as the Hampton Inn app I had as well - they seem identical now.  On the plus side, it has my account info and I didn't need to re-enter cc, name, address, etc to book my stay tonight.
Version 1.4 2012-03-30 1
Dropped it!!! Checked out
Was once a useful tool. However, it is now not user friendly. 
Wake up call 
I hope to return
Version 1.4 2012-03-30 1
This application is truly shameful. It is difficult to believe that it is from the same organization that runs The Astoria and Anatole. In today's age of technology, this is as important as one of your hotels.  For someone who might be new to your organization, this application could well be the first impression. Shameful indeed.
Version 1.4 2012-03-30 1
For a chain as big as you are, this app is horrible. I agree with all the posts about the new update, it is by far the least user friendly app. Hilton you need to spend some time and money to get this app to meet consumer standards.

Thanks
Version 1.4 2012-03-29 1
Seriously?  All the suffering I went through a year ago when the Holiday Inn app broke itself, and now Hilton, unambiguously the better of the two chains, totally screws the pooch.  You expect me to know each and every confirmation number for my stays across multiple cities a week?  

Nice work, guys, way to make me want to go back to Holiday Inn.
Version 1.4 2012-03-29 1
I giant step backward...used to be decent, terrible now.
Version 1.4 2012-03-28 1
What happened?  This is a huge step backward.
Version 1.4 2012-03-28 1
I can't view my reservations anymore! What happened to this app?!
Version 1.4 2012-03-27 1
I went to use the app and what happened? It is like a very basic webapp. Bring back the old app with the rich details and simple navigation. I am HH member and once I could login and get all my details and reservations, but no more. The look of it is cheap and basic and now delete-able.
Version 1.4 2012-03-26 1
I, like many Hilton diamond members, used to like the functionality of seeing ALL my reservations once signed in. Now? I have to manually enter the reservation number!? Come on Hilton you can do better. Fix this issue or consider me deleting the app.
Version 1.4 2012-03-26 1
Whoever led the upgrade of this App missed on critical needs of those traveling a lot. Basically, we 're in need of easily obtainable reservation and change information. As yet another Diamond member, I am astounded that this poor quality App was released - get it fixed quickly or you 'll lose business.
Version 1.4 2012-03-26 1
A mobile app that requires I enter a confirmation number to look up a reservation -- even after I'm signed in with my Honors account?  Eh?

No way to quickly scan for properties using current location?

One star. 

Hilton should take a look at Starwood's app. That is how a mobile hotel app should work.
Version 1.3 2012-03-26 1
When I travel, I like staying at Hilton hotels. I'm always treated well and the rooms are nearly always perfect. I've never had a complaint about a stay.

This app, however, flat out doesn't work. Not even a little. You can not log in from the main screen to check rewards points. The search feature doesn't seem to work. The UI is hideous; it really looks like a small child threw this together in 15 minutes. 

If anyone from Hilton is reading this, please pull this add from the app store. It is a disgrace to your good name.
Version 1.4 2012-03-26 1
This app is absolutely useless. What is there to review since it doesn't offer any functionality. 

Unbelievable.
Version 1.4 2012-03-26 1
Who was the genius that thought it was a good idea to create a separate app for each Hilton family hotel? They are idiots!
Version 1.4 2012-03-26 1
This app is useless. Have to know my reservation number, but I'm already logged in as a Hhonors member? Also it says it can't modify the reservation on line. If that is true, I would still like to see my reservations.
Version 1.4 2012-03-26 1
Where is the quality control on these updates?  I am a Diamond member and use to love this application, now?? What a Junk application this has become.  How do you take an application and break it this badly? Kudos to Hilton for reaching a new low on Application screw ups.
Version 1.4 2012-03-25 1
As a diamond member I used the app nearly every day to view reservations which used to be easily viewed on the ap.  the upgrade has made the ap useless to me, now I have to know my res. numbers to look then up...a big step backwards
Version 1.4 2012-03-24 1
Absolutely annoying that you have to re-credential every time you close the app or change between features. Sometimes it makes you re-credential twice! Terrible planning by the design team. Don't put in an option to "remember me" then force me to re-credential anyhow. So Stupid!

As a frequent traveler and someone that would use this app frequently (if it were user friendly) I would say to my fellow travelers, don't bother. The occasional traveler may find some use out of it, but don't waste your time.
Version 1.4 2012-03-24 1
Most pointless app there is.
Version 1.4 2012-03-23 1
If this version isn't enough to get Usablennet fired, they must be related to a Hilton. I'm a Diamond member and this App isn't worth the space on my IPhone. There are no redeeming qualities to it whatsoever.
Version 1.4 2012-03-23 1
My confirmation number?? Really?? When I'm logged in??  Hello, Marriott.......
Version 1.4 2012-03-23 1
When you make a change to a program, test it before deploying it. Really, it can help.
Version 1.4 2012-03-22 1
Seriously - Take this down as it really does nothing and irritates your loyal users more than anything - Then act like the major hotel change Hilton is and hire someone that knows what they are doing to create a new app that is worthy of Hilton
Version 1.4 2012-03-22 1
Ditto to all the posts about the latest update. I've never seen an app before that posted an update that was worse than the previous version. Almost makes me want to change hotel chains if this the best they can do.
Version 1.4 2012-03-22 1
Can't log in to complete reservation. Latest update didn't fix anything !
Hilton should hire priority club programmers to create this app from scratch.
Version 1.3 2012-03-22 1
For a brand name like Hilton this is really disgraceful. Shame on you!!!!
Version 1.4 2012-03-22 1
Can't view existing reservations unless you have confirmation number.  Keep getting error messages saying can't find page or account information.  Old version was but but it's better than this.
Version 1.4 2012-03-21 1
Dear Hilton,

I think you are underestimating the power of a slick and easy to use app. Please pay someone other than your in-house IT (cause we all know how well Hilton.com works) to design and maintain your apps. You will be doing us and yourselves a favor!

Thank you,
Disappointed
Version 1.4 2012-03-21 1
I was SO excited for this App upgrade as I stay at Hilton properties weekly and looked forward to needed improvements. Please fix - especially reservations.
Version 1.3 2012-03-21 1
Nuff said.  This is an embarrassment
Version 1.4 2012-03-21 1
Well i screwed up - should have read the reviews 1st!!!!  Confirmation number!? C'mon - my reservations should show whether i know all the details or not - that is why I use the app- to get the details of my reservations or make reservations. 
The app is almost useless now - 50% functional for me at most.
Version 1.4 2012-03-21 1
Not worth the download.
The development team for this app must have "phoned it in" because it is worthless; more so than the prior version, if that is even imaginable ...
I would rate it as ZERO stars, but Apple does not allow for that.

Uninstall - Delete
Version 1.4 2012-03-21 1
This update is horrible. Used to save my pw. Now I have to sign in every time. Worse yet I have to sign in twice to see my current reservations.  Last version had horrible color scheme but was at least functional. Give me the last version back. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
Version 1.4 2012-03-21 1
I can't say anything more than fix it.  I'm a Hilton Diamond member and have been for many years.  You've got to be kidding about having to know a confirmation number.

Fix it.  The older version was much better.

If you have not upgraded to this don't.

DO NOT UPGRADE.

Developers, fix it...  I would put ZERO stars but it won't let me.
Version 1.4 2012-03-20 1
I wish I read the other terrible reviews before I 'upgraded' to this version. Even more buggy and useless than before. 

Don't Upgrade!
Version 1.4 2012-03-20 1
It worked, and now they "upgraded" it to broken. It went from mediocre to worthless.
Version 1.4 2012-03-20 2
Still can't see existing reservations when logged in, why would u need confirm #s when already signed in
Version 1.3 2012-03-20 1
Why is this app all busted up yo?
Version 1.3 2012-03-19 1
For a company as big as Hilton, this app is a total embarrassment.
Version 1.3 2012-03-19 1
I expect better. Can't log in to HHonors. Pull it until you fix it.
Version 1.3 2012-03-19 1
Hilton, you can an should do better.
Version 1.3 2012-03-19 1
Not worth the time to download.  Hilton should be ashamed of themselves...
Version 1.3 2012-03-19 1
Used to work great, but now it's quite useless.
Version 1.3 2012-03-19 1
... It used to be fine, but now you can't log in.
Version 1.3 2012-03-19 1
The app is worthless.. When you sign in it takes you to another login screen.. You go back and forth between login screens. This is why I choose Marriott hotels over Hilton hotels.. If your company can't get an app to work correctly how is your customer service?
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
This app used to work really well but now it doesn't work at all. Hopefully they will fix it soon.
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
I was trying to give the front desk my rewards id and couldn't because every time I would log in it would take me to another log in screen. It's used to be great but guess its not working anymore. Please fix!!! I use this app almost once a week. PLEASE!!!
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
As a solidly silver level customer of hilton honors, I am extremely disappointed in this app. It doesn't work at all!  
When your competitors have far superior apps, you have to question the dedication to customer service that the Hilton brand exhibits. It is extremely frustrating not being able to check my reservations or book a room. I truly hope they fix this soon before I'm forced to vote with my feet.
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
Please update this app. It is COMPLETELY useless. I love Hilton, but this is a poor representation of the brand.
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
This app used to have minimal functionality, but now it won't even let me log in.

I think I'm going to use my diamond status to take the Starwood platinum challenge. Time to find another chain for my weekly stays...
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
Have no idea if this app provides any value, since I am unable to sign in.  Confirmed my credentials on the web site, and I highly doubt I fat-fingered them 5 consecutive times on the app.  Get your app together.
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
I stay at Hilton properties weekly and the previous app has been useful tracking and changing reservations. Unfortunately, the latest version of the app is nearly useless and at best very difficult to use.   This is major frustration in today's connected age and I will start looking for other hotel chains to see if they can prove better service.
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
Hilton could have done a lot better.
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
Used to love the app. Now can't login. Just deleted the app.
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
One more negative review, it does nothing at all.
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 1
I've read a lot of bad app reviews that usually have a kernel of truth. However, the reviews for the Hilton app aren't strong enough - the app is completely unusable.

Hilton: this app has so much potential, but is instead pathetic. Just one more quality issue that is pushing this former Diamond member over to Marriott...
Version 1.3 2012-03-17 1
Cannot get beyond login screen. Piece of junk.
Version 1.3 2012-03-17 1
Cannot log in. Everytime you try to log in it brings you back to the user id/password page. Let's go Hilton IT guys, fix this!!
Version 1.3 2012-03-17 2
This was working okay, then I couldn't log in.  I saw that there was an update, that did not help.  I even removed the app and reloaded it, still doesn't work.  This is not what I would expect from Hilton.  This app is no HGI breakfast!
Version 1.3 2012-03-17 1
This app was never that good to begin with. Now it doesn't work at all. POS
Version 1.3 2012-03-17 1
Was working, now not working, what happened?
Version 1.3 2012-03-17 1
Can't log in, can't book a room. Lame.
Version 1.3 2012-03-17 1
Used to work ok but now cannot log in. Very annoying.
Version 1.3 2012-03-17 1
Hilton you are damaging your brand with this app.  Like everyone else, I cannot even log in... The audience for this app, I assume, is frequent travelers like myself who have gold or higher Hhonors status.  You are not putting your best foot forward with your most cherished customers.
Version 1.3 2012-03-17 1
Hilton makes it so hard to stay loyal. This dumb app is the latest affront.
Version 1.3 2012-03-16 1
Can't compare to SPG
Version 1.3 2012-03-16 1
Worked for a few weeks but now I can't log in!
Version 1.3 2012-03-16 1
Like everyone else, can't even sign in. Annoying!
Version 1.3 2012-03-16 1
Can't log in. Could be a great app, but a big FAIL!
Version 1.3 2012-03-15 1
Could be a useful site!  Sends a bad message.
Version 1.3 2012-03-15 1
I could not log into my account or search for hotels with this app because I kept getting an expired session error.  SPG app is much better.
Version 1.3 2012-03-15 1
I agree with all the earlier reviews that the latest update is a total waste. I can't get signed into my account to make any reservations. When that part did work, you could never exist the app midway and come back, because it makes you start all over
Version 1.3 2012-03-14 1
Have never actually completed a reservation successfully. Cant even log in to my account. Second sign in screen asks for account number and password, but there is no button to sign in or continue. Can I rate negative stars?
Version 1.3 2012-03-14 1
After the recent update, I am no longer able to sign in via the App and check in. This adds insult to injury with this already abysmal app. Hilton needs an IT overhaul... Badly.

HGI app still works fine and was able to check in through that.
Version 1.3 2012-03-07 1
Hilton should be embarrassed. This app is frustrating and the worst I've seen.  Calling it a utility is an insult to actual tools. 

Overall issue - this app does not cache any info! If you leave the screen your entire transaction and login status is reset!!! 

Can you imagine if you were checking out on the Hilton site, went to another tab/program and when you switched back to Hilton you were at the homepage?!?  This is a deal-breaker.
Version 1.3 2012-03-06 2
This App will let you check existing reservations, but it doesn't work well off line and it doesn't have a built in calendar for reservation searches. 
It is generally clunky but does the trick.

Could be much improved,
Version 1.3 2012-03-05 1
Really disappointed with their app. Can be used by chain not as a whole for all their hotels. They need to use Priority Club as a benchmark.
Version 1.3 2012-03-04 2
It's a decent app if you want to quickly search and/or book a Hilton hotel - and you know all your details upfront. However, if you were looking to browse the full family of Hilton branded hotels, or if you need to switch to, say, the calendar app to check your travel dates, you're out of luck. Switching apps "forgets" everything you've entered and brings you right back to the beginning ... web apps like this can be convenient, but Hilton should consider building this to be native (so it can store state)! IMHO, you're just as well off using Safari on the full site.
Version 1.3 2012-02-29 1
The app is slow. It takes 5 seconds to come up with the login screen every time. If I switch to get travel entails from email and come back, it starts all over again. 
Auto login prompts every time...not so auto..
When trying to book, it lacks a date picker. It's frustrating bouncing to the calendar and back when it doesn't retain any settings. 

I travel 50 nights a year with Hilton properties...this app isn't helping at all.
Version 1.3 2012-02-27 1
Seriously looks like someone lost a bet and had to design this app. Very limited functionality, with an interface so ugly I nearly thought this app was a fake. On second thought...
Version 1.3 2012-02-21 1
If this were a school project, I would give it a passing grade.  As a business app, it's horrible (and I'm sugar coating it).   It is good for viewing an upcoming reservation, but almost everything I tried couldn't be managed online, which is a problem that extends to their main site.

You can only view your point balance as well, not recent activity even.  Not worth the download.
Version 1.3 2012-02-20 1
Don't even bother downloading, waste of space and time.
Version 1.3 2012-02-20 1
Terribly made, l lost my search five times as I was selecting the hotel and making the reservations. Signing into the app does not sign you into make a reservation or to see your reservations. This is a poorly made app.
Version 1.3 2012-02-12 1
Diamond member that finds this utterly and totally useless. Get with it Hilton and at least try to show some effort. While you are at it, upgrade you horrible  Hilton Honors website too. 
Marriott and SPG put your IT group to shame.
Version 1.3 2012-02-11 1
Hilton please consolidate all your chain apps into one and pull this one until you get a good solid iOS app!  This is embarrassing for Hilton.
Version 1.3 2012-02-07 5
This app is so much easier than searching google for a hotel
Version 1.3 2012-02-04 1
Waste of time..
Version 1.3 2012-02-02 2
Very poor site for multi-billion dollar Corp! Will only show point balance. Not able to access any other info. Sorry Hilton should do better!
Version 1.3 2012-01-21 1
Hilton is just not ready for app. Very disappointed...
Version 1.3 2012-01-19 1
What a waste of time, I am a Diamond member and this app is useless.
Version 1.3 2012-01-13 2
Wow!  This app is sad and needs to be scrapped.  Who the heck thinks white type on a light blue background is a good idea. Like the idea of the e check in but wish could see a floor layout it something.
Version 1.3 2012-01-12 1
1.Doesn't do a great job of listing hotels by distance, once a city is selected. 
2. No tracking of Hilton Honors Points or Stay!! We NEED THIS!!!
3. We are the Hampton, Doubletree and Embassy Apps better than the Hilton App?
Version 1.3 2012-01-03 2
I travel a lot staying in hotels about 100+ nights a year.  The older version of this app, although not great, was better than this recent update.  I use  an iPhone 4 access the app.  To improve:  1) the app will not keep me logged in to my honors account.  I should be able to log in when I open the app and remain logged in while I navigate. 2) When I'm on the road, I need to know what hotels are coming up on my route.  There should be a map included so that I can easily click on the hotels that best fit my driving schedule.  3) One can not exit the app without losing all information requiring the need to re-input all information.  This is very inconvenient.  In general, the last updates make the app a last resort as it almost useless - especially since it won't remember my honors information.  I have taken to staying at Holiday Inns - which I would prefer not to do - simply because this app has become more frustrating with recent updates instead of easier to use.  Keep all the pictures you are trying to include for computer users.  Streamline the app for fast and easy access.
Version 1.3 2012-01-03 5
This is a great app. I love the simplicity. Does what it should, locate and book hotel rooms.
Version 1.3 2011-12-31 1
Why would a company even bother paying someone to write this horrible app.  It doesn't maintain state at all so every time you open it, you have to go through all the steps over again to get back to the hotel you were looking at. If someone sends you a txt, you can't leave the app, read the txt, and go back to where you left off. That may not sound like much but it's a royal pain. Navigation is terrible as well which just compounds the problems. 1-star only because I can't choose zero stars
Version 1.3 2011-12-30 1
No real value with this limited functionality
Version 1.3 2011-12-30 1
For an international brand, with multiple chains of hotels worldwide, this app delivers so little functionality, it is simply annoying to use it and waste of time.  It makes me want to switch to Marriott.  I cannot even find hotels outside the US. Terrible.  I agree, it was probably a goal for some CIO.
Version 1.3 2011-12-27 1
The App was some goal for a CIO or program manager and they delivered the most basic of apps. No way to see you hhonors history, or really manage your hhonors account. When you search for a hotel it only shows Hilton hotels, does not show you other brands, each brand has its own app.
Version 1.3 2011-12-21 1
The site was built by a 5 year old. This has no smart functionality. geez - did Conrad use the site.
Version 1.3 2011-12-14 1
I downloaded this today and just as quickly have removed it from my iPhone. It crashes when attempting to make a reservation.
Version 1.3 2011-12-05 1
Pretty worthless. Good luck trying to access an existing reservation to try and cancel or modify. It just keeps asking for your HH number/password repeatedly. This latest version of the app is buggy and not very helpful.
Version 1.3 2011-12-04 1
I really appreciated the functions of this app before the update a few months ago. Now it is not worth my time it takes to loop around links that do not work. I'll wait for the fix before I try it again.
Version 1.3 2011-12-03 1
The app doesn't have very much functionality and the information on reservations is not presented in an easy to use way. Can't click on a phone number within an individual reservation to call the hotel is just one example on poor design that impacts customer experience.
Version 1.3 2011-12-03 1
This application use to be decent. For two months now I have been unable to make a single reservation through the app. I log in, find the hotel I want, and then when I try and book it, it asks me to log in again. The request to log in is circular preventing you from ever actually making the reservation. I've called Hilton about the issue with no response. I've stayed over 180 nights with Hilton this year, tonight though, you loose my business because you are too difficult to book with.
Version 1.3 2011-12-03 1
Horrible functionality! Have to login again and start search over every time you minimize, or click on a hyperlink within app. Uninstalling.
Version 1.3 2011-12-01 1
This app has always been my least favorite as a frequent traveler. Simple thinks like logging in and navigating are useless. The update made it even worse. Now when I log in I still have to re-enter my user name and password. Take a look at the "Avis" app Hilton developers. This is the way an app like this should function.
Version 1.3 2011-11-30 2
Older version was fantastic. New one is a significant step backwards and offers little functionality.
Version 1.3 2011-11-27 1
Why bother even offering this app?  I installed this quite some time ago hoping that regular updates would breathe some life into it. Forget it!  Uninstalled.
Version 1.3 2011-11-23 1
Come on Hilton, your travelers deserve better than this.  Crashes when booking hotel.  Cannot always see current reservations, especially advance purchase.  Let's keep up with the times!!!
Version 1.3 2011-11-23 1
The App works sometimes, but is not reliable. When App works, functionality and details are extremely limited, so to use the App is more trouble than it's worth.  
It's a poor App and Hilton should be embarrassed. 
Use the Hilton website instead.
Version 1.3 2011-11-20 1
The app doesn't provide any detail or control of HHonors account.  There needs to be a map when searching for a hotel.  Also, need the ability to hold search results when switching to other apps.  Even a history of previous searches would be helpful so I don't have to re-enter search criteria.
Version 1.3 2011-11-17 1
Wow. What are you guys, like a multi-billion dollar organization? And this app if it were actually a workable, simple app, it would cost you $20 or $30 G? It's disappointing. I'd use this app all the time if it would work! Half the time it's down!
Version 1.3 2011-11-12 2
This app works but is not user friendly. No map and works from city center not location. Intercontinental is much better. How do they screw up something so simple?
Version 1.3 2011-11-10 2
Janky
Version 1.3 2011-11-03 1
Doesn't tell you the day of the week you have selected.   Then doesn't set the departure date to be after the arrive date.  Kind of basic stuff..
Version 1.3 2011-10-29 1
As a frequent traveler, and a HH Diamond member, I find most airline and travel related apps to be much more rich in features than the Hilton app. This app could do much more, but clearly Hilton has other priorities. I get that. I want clean rooms, good service, etc. But Hilton this app is so subpar it makes me wonder why you don't try to do better.
Version 1.3 2011-10-28 1
Where are my stays? Where I's my progress to the next level? How many stays do I news to next level? Why can't I book a reservation? Worthless app.
Version 1.3 2011-10-27 1
Worked ok at first.  Now can't do anything but get my point balance.  Can't see existing reservations or make one. Tried to delete and reinstall.  Totally worthless now. Hilton should be embarrassed and fix it.
Version 1.3 2011-10-26 3
I do appreciate the ability to book a room on the fly and being able to log in and access my HH Diamond info in doing so...

HOWEVAH....

How hard would it be to save my search when I need to click back out to check the date (which you do not provide for some odd reason), answer a call, or an email?  It's ridiculous to have to start all over every time, but just like their website, Hilton showed up to prom in sweatpants with a boner.  

You'd think a company this big would be on the forefront of technology- not tripping on it.
Version 1.3 2011-10-24 1
This app is almost useless. Scheduling a reservation is almost impossible. Are you actually paying someone to develop and manage this app? Did Paris design it?
Version 1.3 2011-10-21 4
Just downloaded yesterday. I was able to view my upcoming reservations and see my rewards point balance. If you want to completely log out you have to delete your password. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. The app seems to do what it's supposed to.
Version 1.3 2011-10-20 1
C'mon Hilton, this is one pathetic app. Who wrote it, Motel 6? Doesn't keep you logged - ever. Returning to home screen or multi-tasking to check calendar (makes sense when booking a room, right?) causes you to lose all your work on the reservation and start over. This app is an insult to the quality of your brand. As a diamond maybe it's time to check out the Marriott app.
Version 1.3 2011-10-20 1
Used this app to book 3-4 nights a week for business travel. Completely useless since most recent update. Will not book another reservation at any Hilton property until this gets fixed. HH point balance 702k.
Version 1.3 2011-10-16 1
Can't see any of the past stays and breakdown of points
Version 1.3 2011-10-15 5
It books a room easy and quick.
Version 1.3 2011-10-15 1
Fine if you're wanting to see what's available. But once an available location is found, you can't book it. Every time I've tried, it churns, and then the error "too many http redirects".
Version 1.3 2011-10-07 1
PLEASE UPDATE ICON TO AN HD ONE THAT RESPECTS MY IPHONES AWESOME DISPLAY CAPABILITIES!
Version 1.3 2011-10-03 1
I will assume future versions will provide more functionality than the present one: version 1.3.  Until then this only deserves one star.
Version 1.3 2011-09-26 2
There are too many missing functionalities in this app. (for example you can't view some reservations). Disappointing. I'm looking forward the next version.
Version 1.3 2011-09-13 2
Gives you the following error when attempting to book reward reservation for the past 8+ months:  "This page is currently under maintenance.
We're sorry for the inconvenience, please check back later."

Needs serious upgrade.
Version 1.3 2011-09-12 5
Does the basic things I need with no hype. Easy to use and fast.
Version 1.3 2011-09-10 1
Essentially this app let's you do little more than find a room, you can't book a reward, you can't view upcoming reservations.  It needs serious work!
Version 1.3 2011-09-04 4
Great app if you're an HHonors member. It's nothing fancy but gets the job done while you're on the go. I booked and cancelled reservations, both regular and reward, and it worked just fine.
Version 1.3 2011-09-02 3
Please pay attention to these reviews to make this app better. And add a Twitter feed
Version 1.3 2011-08-27 1
This app works for it's main purpose - finding reservations/ rooms. However it is maddening to use and should never have been released in this form. The main problem is that if you switch to any other app, you lose ALL your work and have to start over from scratch. For example, when making a reservation, I switches to Contacts to get my Hilton Honors number. Back to Hilton: lost everything and even had to engraving city search again!  Today most maddening was entering Mountain View, CA. This gave me a list of three cities in CA to choose from. When I clicked on the one I wanted, it unexpectedly took me to Maps to show me where it is (which I know).  Switched back to Hilton: lost all work and had to enter the city search again. This is NOT how iPhone apps work!
Version 1.3 2011-08-26 1
This is one for the books!

A major company whose livelihood depends on maintaining its brand allows this app to remain as is for months on end. 

Long time travelers are making reasonable suggestions, and Hilton ignores them. 

This is a recipe for disaster. 

If Hilton were public I would sell short. 

We've heard their (non)response. It's  our option as customers to make our choice.
Version 1.3 2011-08-26 1
Tripit shows more about your Honors account compared to this Hilton app.
Version 1.3 2011-08-22 1
App offers limited functionally and there are other apps that can book hotels and track your rewards.
Version 1.3 2011-08-22 3
Please provide folio info via app
Version 1.3 2011-08-21 2
Writing this so Hilton might spend some time and improve this app. I HATE having to reload all dates and location everytime I click out of app. Is it that hard to save it?  

I usually try to stay at Hilton brands and I am a HHonors member as well. Make this app better you guys!!!!
Version 1.3 2011-08-20 1
Not only does it not save info that you have already put in, it also has a disclaimer on the hotel amenities section that says "not all amenities are found at all locations." Why even list anything if the hotel you're looking at may or may not even have any of it???
Version 1.0 2011-08-14 1
Piece o'junk. All Hilton has to do is read 20 reviews, address those problems and this app might be useful. 

WHY WHY WHY have a separate app for each Hilton chain?  I just want a room. I yell you the dates, you tell me which hotels have rooms and for how much. What could be easier?  But, NOOO. Hilton has an app for Hilton, an app for Hampton, an app for Embassy...

Look for a hotel. Find one? Great. Now click on the hotel address.  Go ahead. Like where it is? Want to book it?  Too bad. You have to start over. 

Can't book a hotel on the West Coast after 9:00 PM. I'm on the road a lot, sometimes I have to. Why can't you do it? Because Hilton has decided that it is TOMORROW already. Yep. After Midnight Eastern time means that, as far as Hilton is concerned, it is also after Midnight Pacific time. Don't argue. Don't look at your watch. It's tomorrow. Hilton says so. 

My AARP number and my AAA number will NEVER CHANGE. So, why won't Hilton store them in my profile? They store what kind of bed I want. They store my no-smoking preference. But won't store the membership numbers. I'm trying to use the app at an airport and have to dig out my wallet, retrieve cards and enter 14 digit numbers on an iPhone. 

Hilton, DO YOU CARE?  Do you want my SIXTH YEAR of Diamond level business? Yes, it's that bad, Hilton. Look at the Starwood app. Take notes  make yours do what it does. Yes, Starwood app. . You know, the one I'll be using when I transfer my business there...
Version 1.3 2011-08-11 1
Does not provide enough hotel information.
Version 1.0 2011-08-09 2
Along with other comments on maps, etc, I have tried to book several reward reservations over the past few months, but the apps says that the page is unavailable.
Version 1.0 2011-08-08 1
For such a major player, you would think someone would pay more attention to this issue!!!!  I haven't even got passed the log in page!!!!   Common!!!!!!!!
Version 1.3 2011-08-07 2
Others have said it. If you look up a map location of a hotel the app loses all info about your reservation request, like the city and travel dates. The multiple times I tried booking with points the app said to try again later. Pretty much useless.
Version 1.3 2011-08-04 2
There is no integration into standard iPhone functions such as maps or find the closest hotel to me. Very underwhelming. Just as kludgy as their website which should be little surprise to regular users.
Version 1.0 2011-07-31 1
You go round in circles re-entering the same information. Unclear commands.  Awful.
Version 1.3 2011-07-30 2
hhonors really needs to come out with one consolidated app.
I really don't see the purpose for each hotel line-up having to have to have their own app.
Am I seriously the only one who wants to know my hhonors points, my status and finding any hhonor affiliated hotel in a certain area?
I really don't want to open up the double tree app and look for rates, then open up hampton and look around, then embassy and search, and hilton and search.
One app is enough....
Version 1.3 2011-07-22 2
Not very intuitive. Very slow (over 3G). Need drop down calendar instead of just a date chooser. You can't toggle between a calendar and this app. As soon as you do it makes you start over completely (no multi tasking). Great concept but I wish this actually worked. I would use all the time. Don't act like you don't have the money to make a decent app. 2 stars for the concept, 0 stars for execution.
Version 1.3 2011-07-14 2
This is a half hearted effort. No multitasking support. You can't see prices on many hotels even for nonrefundable reservations.
Version 1.3 2011-07-10 2
I book at Hilton hotels whenever I can. This app reflects poorly on the Hilton brand name. It seems unable to remember the last choices made - and offers no shortcuts to completion.
Version 1.3 2011-07-09 1
One of the worst I have ever used. Just deleted it from my iPhone. If you click to see a hotel address on a map, it logs you out. If you try to view your calendar, it logs you out. True frustration and not worth it - not even for free.
Version 1.3 2011-07-04 1
The entire app is just a portal to a website, which makes it slow and buggy. Also, I couldn't sort by price when searching for hotels.
Version 1.3 2011-07-01 2
Seems elementary that a hotel chain as big as Hilton (& so many loyal business customers) would understand the value of a good app.
Version 1.3 2011-06-25 5
Go to the website if you need more about specific hotels. I think it's a great app. Book rooms from it all the time.
Version 1.3 2011-06-25 1
I can't believe a major hotel chain has such an inadequate app. If I click on the hotel address to see a map view it closes the app and you have to retype city, dates, everything from scratch. The Rewards stay is down regularly and it's not integrated into the regular search. It's a separate link, and requires you to enter your info yet again. I HATE this app.
Version 1.3 2011-06-22 1
Besides the very basic interface it is lacking the reward stay function, even though there is a button for it!!!
Version 1.3 2011-06-20 1
I travel a good deal. From Orlando hotel I entered "Bank of America" with location services enabled. B of A is 5 miles away. App routed me on a 900 mile trip to Ohio with a fare of $2700+. Epic Fail. Deleting.
Version 1.3 2011-06-18 2
The app is easy to use for the current functionality. But The only people who would download and use thus app are frequent Hilton customers. So where are my favorite hotels that I saved on the website? Why is hhonors section still under construction?
Version 1.3 2011-06-16 1
Found the Hampton inn on the aaa app
Holyoke app couldn't find it's own hotel
To bad I couldn't apply zero stars
Version 1.3 2011-06-09 1
I just downloaded this app in preparation for an upcoming trip. We will be driving quite a distance and not sure where we will end up for the night. I thought it would be great if I could book a room on the road when I have a better idea of where we will stop. Clicked on the "book a rewards stay" and it comes up that it is under construction. Really? I can book the same hotel through the regular reservation page.
So basically your loyal customers are the only people who can't use your app. Gee thanks.
Version 1.3 2011-06-08 1
This app is poorly designed. As a Hilton Honors diamond member I would like to have the use if a quality app for Hilton Hotels, to bad this app is not
Version 1.3 2011-06-08 3
I use this app often while traveling, but I hate that it does not show pictures of hotel rooms. It would also be nice if they detailed the age of the hotel as newer hotels are better than the old. Needs to be more like Starwood hotels application.
Version 1.3 2011-05-31 2
Pretty weak for a commerical app- this should drive sales to their hotels but is pretty weak. Wont let you save a list of " favorite" hotels,
Version 1.3 2011-05-21 1
This app is worse than going to the dentist. Whoever did this app has no sense of how people are using it.  How many bad reviews does it take to fix this??

Keep in mind that people are trying to use this app while on the road. If I am using an iPhone and have to reference other data (such as AAA, etc) I want to go back to this app without going through all the menus again. 

Also the searches are stupidly formatted and use bad human engineering for screen navigation.

Too bad because this world be a good opportunity for a really good programmer (whom you obviously are not)
Version 1.3 2011-05-20 1
I thought this app would be great when it came out a while ago but in find myself never using it when booking hotels. You cant see info on the hotel you're booking, like pics of the rooms or nearby attractions. You're much better off booking through the traditional website. When searching based on location, it didn't even include the one i know is in my town but only showed me ones 50 miles away! Don't even waste your time.
Version 1.3 2011-05-19 1
Mediocre application. Do not waste your time with it.
Version 1.3 2011-05-18 3
Would love it if I could add existing reservations directly to my calendar automatically (by clicking a button).
Version 1.3 2011-05-15 1
This is a useless app.  It has no redeeming value at all.  It does nothing for you.  The "Motel 6" of hotel apps!
Version 1.3 2011-05-05 1
Slow. Have to log on manually each time you start it up, although it does keep your log on info. How about automatically logging on at startup?  If you are in the middle of, say ordering a snack for your room at arrival and you respond to a text, the app essentially starts over, you lose all the info, and have to log in again. How about a Hhonors redemption certificate display for redemption sort if like the Delta app dies boarding passes?  GET RID OF THE PAPER  Not intuitive at all. Very poor attempt at an app. C'mon Hilton! You can do better than this slipshod piece of cr@p!
Version 1.0 2011-05-05 1
This app is very frustrating. U have to go to each hotel to check price then it doesn't save info. I expect more from the Hilton hotels. It is hard to use but a bit better than nothing.
Version 1.3 2011-05-04 1
Terrible app.  Everything is "under maintenance."  Can't find cities or airports outside the US.
Version 1.3 2011-04-21 2
Does not give list all of the various Hilton brands....not very useful
Version 1.3 2011-04-17 1
As a Hilton Honors customer, I'm not happy the use of my HH rewards NOT available -  Same with the Hampton app. This is the error, and for a day so far -> 
This page is currently under maintenance.
We're sorry for the inconvenience, please check back later.
Version 1.3 2011-04-14 1
This app still needs work.  It doesn't save what you've selected if you exit the app, and gives suggestions based on your search that may be 100's of miles away.
Version 1.3 2011-03-29 5
Simple flow makes it easy to book
Version 1.3 2011-03-28 5
Quick and easy way to book a room.
Version 1.0 2011-03-26 5
Perfect for my needs
Version 1.3 2011-03-25 2
Good if it showed the price of the room before I had to book it. It just showed the room not the price. Fix this. And fix the icon, it's blurry.
Version 1.3 2011-03-24 4
It just requires you to know what you're doing! I travel 3 weeks/ month and always stay at Hiltons. This app is easy to use and has been my saving grace on a number of occasions. Overall, great app!
Version 1.3 2011-03-24 5
This app saved me a couple of times from sleeping in the airport. Exactly what i need, quick access to relevant information with seamless booking. kudos!
Version 1.3 2011-03-24 5
Easy to use!  I wish more hotels had apps like this
Version 1.3 2011-03-23 1
An app for each property really? What do I care about the Hilton in Dallas when I am in houston. It used to be semi tolerable until the last update. Take a look at holiday inns priority club app and tell me this one it great. I just assume wait on hold with my travel agent that use this app ever again. DELETE.
Version 1.0 2011-03-13 2
I love Hilton Hotels but this app crashes a lot and unfortunately you cannot look up various amenities at each property (ie. Outdoor Pool, etc)
I keep waiting for them to update it bit an update never comes. Sad HHonors Grrrl...
Version 1.3 2011-03-07 5
I use this all the time, and works great. Nice job!
Version 1.3 2011-03-07 5
This app is great. Straightforward, packs tons of info into each listing screen. I travel internationally a lot and the ability to get geo-location in addition to wing able to log into rewards? What else do you want. Also, if you have the AT&T world plan with international assist turned in in settings, calling any property is seamless.  Kudos!
Version 1.3 2011-03-07 5
I use Hilton all the time and this works perfectly!!
Version 1.3 2011-03-07 1
Does not remember log in or place.  Makes you list the country when searching by airport code.  I guess they don't realize that each airport code is unique.  Also, please give me the ability to view in US Dollars.  I had to switch to another app to do the conversion and when i came back, i had to start all over even though i used the multitasking way of switching apps.  

The hotels are much better than the programming.  It is much easier to just call for reservations.
Version 1.3 2011-03-05 1
Hhonors crashes every time. Doesn't pull up correct properties. If you receive a call you have to start over
Version 1.3 2011-03-04 1
Downloaded the app to find a Hilton property and check rates to make a reservation. It didn't even bring up the correct properties near me. I had to access the website instead.
Version 1.3 2011-03-03 1
Every time you launch the app it "restarts" rather than starting at the place where you left off. You hop over to contacts to try to find the address of where you have to be and go back to the app and it goes to page one. 

Do yourself a favor: Hire a UI engineer.
Version 1.3 2011-02-21 1
Doesnt keep current process open.  If you leave the app, say, to get needed info, its not there when you come back.  Not that you closed the app, just went to another ifone app.  Another time, in the app, something happened and i was back at the begining having to start all over yet again.  Dont be wastin' my time dangit!
Version 1.3 2011-02-16 1
Tried to enter a Florida city and it gave me a list of cities 500 miles away!  Also needs a true calendar option. And then when you try to look at all rates for different rooms, you have to just book instead of comparing. Too bad for Hilton. This could have been useful. I think i will stick with Kayak's app instead.  I will be deleting after leaving this review.
Version 1.3 2011-02-13 1
Would have given zero stars if i could.  Completely useless. Slow, no sort capabilities (brand) and the search by airport code doesn't work - why do I need to put a state in when using the exact airport code? I tried to search for hotels near LaGuardia (LGA) in NY and it came back with nonsense suggestions in upstate NY and NJ? I was hoping 1.3 would have been better than precious versions but besides a new look and color, it's the same useless app. You're better off going to their mobile web site - same look and feel but "behaves" better and doesn't take up memory on your iPhone.
Version 1.3 2011-02-08 1
The misnamed "upgrade" made this previously helpful app totally unworkable.  It will not take a 'remember me' automatic login and insists upon a manual login each time;  without a manual login, existing reservations are unviewable. Who, in business and on-the-road, has time for that kind of nonsense?  Phone calls to Hilton elicited puzzlement (they'd never heard of the app--can't blame them for wanting to disown this embarrassment) until finally a Hilton rep finds a note:  "We don't know anything about this app but you can contact the developer".  Nope, email to the developer, UsableNet in D.C., went unanswered.   So the lesson is twofold:  first, Hilton bought a pig-in-a-poke with UsableNet's lousy app;  and second, UsableNet's unresponsiveness undercuts the historically outstanding responsiveness of its client, Hilton, and both suffer for it.  If you need an app to keep track of your hotel reservations, this is definitely NOT the answer.
Version 1.0 2011-01-16 3
The app is ok. It allows you to make reservations just fine for all Hilton brand hotels. I have never bothered with the other apps (Hampton, etc.). 

One major suggestion for improvement: INCLUDE WIFI LOGIN FUNCTIONALITY! Logging into wifi on the iPhone through HHonors is a pain. The app could easily make that easier.
Version 1.0 2010-12-05 1
Don't bother with this one. Total waste of phone memory. I'm a long time business travel and I use Hilton brands exclusively. They would be horrified know their name is on something this bad.
Version 1.0 2010-11-27 3
As a Hilton diamond member that travels every week, it does the job. It could be better buy it will take care of your reservations and hotel stays.
Version 1.0 2010-11-17 3
Come on Hilton Worldwide...seriously!! One app!  ONE APP!!  Great, I can search Hilton Hotels with this app, but it does nothing to find other Hilton properties...instead there is a separate app for EACH ONE...really??  Make one app with the ability to search ALL of your properties: Embassy, Homewood, Hampton, Hilton, etc..  This app does me no good.  Also, it would be helpful if the search results were populated in a Google Map...or atleast give me the option to see the results in a map view in relation to each other...location is sometimes better than price.  Please make an update to this app.
Version 1.0 2010-11-10 2
App is almost totally built around finding and booking hotel, does little to manage Honors account and profile.  I expected it to be more like web.  Should offer ability to check out and see room bill via app.
Version 1.0 2010-11-04 1
Dont waste ur time with this one.  I'm a Hilton  Diamond member and this app is the worst I've ever used!
Version 1.0 2010-10-20 1
Tried and alas deleted. Would not remember my user info, which I could have overlooked at a push. However, problems with search and the biggy for me, showed zero miles and no record of reservations, even the one for the next four days.  I even linked to web site (after four attempts) inputted info but still zero info for current and past. This app was more of a hassle than help. Will use phone when away from computer.
Version 1.0 2010-10-16 1
A Hilton App, Wonderful!, I can do my bookings from my phone...well, not really,
Attempted to book the first of 3 separate reservations, the search is painful,
you just get bounced back and forth between the same screens.
Log in, get logged out, search for available properties get logged out.
If the app has trouble finding a match you are lost.
Due to the nature of my travels, I do not often stay in major metro areas, thus the need for search.
IMHO very buggy.
I could not recommend this to any but the most casual of users.
Come on Hilton, the reason I stay at your properties is because of the Quality, THE QUALITY!
There is no quality to this app, just struggles.
Also no property info, not much of anything really.
I will try it again when they fix the bugs.
Version 1.0 2010-10-11 2
A thin wrapper for Hilton's chronically slow web site. Don't switch tabs during a reservation search - you'll just have to start over!  And they won't remember what city you were searching in. Really quite lame.
Version 1.0 2010-10-09 3
Seems pretty good, especially to instantly retrieve current reservations. But the "find locations near me" is irrelevant. I'm in Houston, 35 miles NW of town, but this feature sees me as in Houston downtown, which is where my options begin- so it has no idea where I actually am.
Version 1.0 2010-09-11 1
Times out during searches, forgets your HHonors number. Too bad, because I would use it.
Version 1.0 2010-09-09 3
Needs a way to save favorite or recent hotels. Not sure if this is any better than using the web site.
Version 1.0 2010-09-06 1
Since the release of this app I have not been able to complete eCheck-in because the completion button ends up under the button bar at the bottom of the screen. Amazing to me that Hilton has not fixed this.
Version 1.0 2010-08-26 5
Not sure what the problem is. Maybe user error. I had no problem logging in and my reservations showed up. I was able to see my hhonors account. Great app.
Version 1.0 2010-08-26 2
I agree with the last review. Its annoying that I only can search Hilton brand on this app. It should be able to search the other Hilton brands as well. Its a hassle to have an app for each brand and do several different searches. Too complicated when you are on the road.
Version 1.0 2010-08-25 3
Honors checkin does not work.
Version 1.0 2010-08-24 1
They framed a web page in an app!!
What a shame for a group like Hilton
Version 1.0 2010-08-13 5
Easy search and book function. If you travel a lot, particularly globally, download this app. You can access your HHonors account and check in through your iPhone if you are gold it diamond with Hilton.
Version 1.0 2010-08-10 1
First thing I wanted to do when I downloaded this app was to be able to check my honors account and it won't let me sign in. Seems like a pretty basic function that they can't make work and don't seem to care to put an update out for.

Great app, use it all the time as a diamond member. It needs 2 things to make it perfect:
1- be able to remember your discount codes (AAA, corporate, etc) your website too.
2- be able to rebook your last few stays as a quick reservation.
Version 1.0 2010-08-02 1
It seems to lose it!
I cancelled a reservation, and was charged anyway. They have no record of cancellation.
If you do use it, take a screenshot of the cancel confirmation. It didn't email me or anything!!!

Most of these problems mentioned about not logging in are user error--that's the only good thing about this app; I use it to check my hhonors balance.  Otherwise, this app is lame, I expect much more usability and options from Hilton.  And I wish they would design a good hhonors app or atleast a good mobile site.

Good app,,,,,,,

It doesn't even work!  You can't login to the Hilton honors account.
Version 1.0 2010-07-03 1
Seriously the worst app I've ever downloaded. You actually can't log into your honors account. It just keeps driving you back to the login screen.  Good thing they run their hotels better than the app performs. Don't waste your time by downloading this - save yourself the frustration and use their website.

Really, Hilton...with your pockets, etc this app is just a klunker. 

I tried to find a hotel room in NYC yesterday on the app...put in my information (note here: data entry is not intuitive, no auto fill...would not recognize New York City as being in NY state, date has to be entered manually, not selected from calendar, etc)..then the hotels it delivered could not be sorted by distance, etc.  Listed all Hilton properties before Doubletree, Hampton Inn, etc...regardless of distance.  had to page past Long Island and NJ  Hilton properties before I got to other brands that were in Manhattan.  Nearly all of the hotels on the first and 2nd pages were "not available" and no way to sort those out.  

this is worthless...web or 800 number is much preferred alternative

please get something that is more in keeping with the HIlton brand....love the hotels, hate the app.

thanks

One would expect the app would work similar to the hhonors.com site where you can seach by hotel brands. Being a techie it's not a difficult task. But I guess the IT and the business units forgot that the frequent biz travellers may be using this app. The decision to not allow the search for all brands was a poor design.  Thanks alot for making this app almost useless!!!!
Version 1.0 2010-06-07 2
Rather blah.  Then again, Hilton.com isn't that great either. App is decent If you know where you need to book, but not great for browsing.
Version 1.0 2010-05-12 1
Nothing really interesting about app. Later!
Version 1.0 2010-05-09 2
I am a frequent Hilton user and book via Internet often. I have not found this app to be useful in searching for hotels in an area. It needs to have more search options, such as miles radius and brand of hotel (such as Hampton Inn). I searched for Freehold, NJ and I received choices that were in New York City, which is 50 miles away.
Lots of room for improvement. Check back later!
Version 1.0 2010-05-06 2
Well done app with great applications, but really needs fixes.  It let's you see everything that you need, and then doesn't let you have them.
Version 1.0 2010-04-17 1
This app was obviously never tested properly. If you are on the road and hope to check-in forget it. The menu bar at the bottom of the screen covers links which are located at the bottom of the page... and no, you cannot resize in landscape mode. Therefore you won't be able to access many infos or functions, which is frustrating if you want to use this app in real life and not just use it as a toy. For example you can't do eCheck-in with this app... nor go to "My Account" since those links are covered by the menu bar. More frustrating is that Hilton released this app and just forgot about it. No quality control, no followup, no update. I don't know who designed this app for them, but it looks very "fisher price" and amateurish... I generally like the brand overall, but let's be serious here!
Version 1.0 2010-04-03 1
Some things kindof work. But most things don't like check in now, previous stays, amenities. Some links at top and bottom of some pages won't let you touch them. Hilton should get their money back from whomever made this app for them and apologize to users for approving it.
Version 1.0 2010-03-16 5
I'm on the road constantly for work and love the ability to book a last minute room or an HHonors reward stay. The request upon arrival feature lets you preorder food and other things so that it is in your room when you check in.
Version 1.0 2010-03-12 1
Using their web site is better.
Version 1.0 2010-02-18 3
I am a diamond member so I use this app often. Please add a calendar function to the reservation page. This will help in remembering what day of the week when you book. Also could use a save as appointment like your web site.
Version 1.0 2010-02-15 2
1) Sort options are primitive
2) Only one app is needed for Hilton
3) HHoners section could have a point breakdown, and other avenues to adjust my account. 
4) Previous Stays?  Reciept?
Version 1.0 2010-02-01 1
Doesn't remember searches when going back. Plus keeps reseting all the time.
Version 1.0 2010-01-18 2
Needs to remember my searches across sessions, and save a list of my favorite properties. Otherwise, a good start.
Version 1.0 2010-01-05 5
I actually see all properties in any of the apps, just different entries. Yes I'll see Hilton first, but I just booked in Embassy Suites from this Hilton app. Nice that my HHonors number is saved across the apps.
It's a keeper.
Version 1.0 2010-01-03 5
Downloaded and used it on the go the same day! Will definetily use it again. Thanks Hilton for providing this great tool for your members. It makes it easier for me to pick a Hilton brand over my other preferred brands.
Version 1.0 2009-12-31 4
They need to integrate all the Hilton family hotels into on app, not seperate apps.
Version 1.0 2009-12-26 5
As a business traveler who travels extensively for a living, I stay In hotels 3-4 nights a week, mostly in Hilton branded locations. The ap allows me to do exactly what I need- make change and cancel reservations in the US. Highly recommend to other road warriors familiar with the Hilton chain.
Version 1.0 2009-12-08 3
Handy, but fix the bugs and add hotel detail.
Version 1.0 2009-12-02 4
Very helpful.
Version 1.0 2009-12-02 1
Forgets your search. Does not let you sort.  Not customer oriented.
Version 1.0 2009-11-30 2
Needs property information and photos. Very one dimensional, but functional.
Version 1.0 2009-11-22 4
I would go online & do all of this. The app pretty much is a sleek template and you can do as much as online. I had problems in the app in booking Reward Reservations and Online check-in. In Reward Reservations, it'd bring up the hotel, but I couldn't select anything. With online check-in, the "complete check-in" is so far at the bottom, that it's covered and you can't select it. 

Until minor changes are done, I'd recommend just going to the mobile online site.
Version 1.0 2009-11-22 5
Hilton did it again, they are way ahead of the game from the other brand names. This is why Hilton is the largest hotelier on the planet.

Awesome...
Version 1.0 2009-11-13 5
It allows you to search for not only Hilton hotels, but All brands including Hilton Grand Vacations. I just made a reservation for Parc Soleil at Hilton Grand Vacations Club. You can log into your Hilton Hhonors account and see all of your reservations.
Version 1.0 2009-11-11 5
Fantastic app. I was able to book the closest hotel to my current location, from my phone. Also received the confirmation email......on my phone. No issues booking Embassy Brand hotels from the app. Was also able to search all other Hilton brand hotels as well. After the intial search, the closest hotel was displayed at the bottom of the screen. Had to scroll down to see it, a bit confusing at first. Hotel information and reservation screens fit perfectly on the screen.
Version 1.0 2009-11-11 1
Why separate apps for separate brands under the Hilton umbrella?
