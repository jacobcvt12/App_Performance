 (Just downloaded it because of vine) A viner commented on a vine that you can 100 followers if you go to vinemove.com so I went and then it said you had to download this app of 2 others so I just wanted to see if it was true. Anyways idk I'm not a traveler I just wanna see if what they're saying is true.

 (Be careful) After a nine day visit we are carefully checking our credit statements
The Blu is a nice resort in St Martin and has a good staff however the front desk team are very revenue driven and quite eager to charge you as much and as often as possible
We found a substantial error on our room and when trying to extend a few extra days found a verbal quote policy that was like negotiating for a used car
They did fix my bill and removed bogus charges but we had to speak with 4 people
My suggestion is to not book direct but you must use Expedia and carefully watch your credit card and room charges
It is a beautiful location on the French side and the people are friendly

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-18 5
 (good for traveling guy) this app is good for what I do by traveling around the midwest and never knowing where I may need to stay based on the leads I get.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-17 1
 (Most Confusing Travel App Out there) I use Expedia's web site all of the time for travel, but the iPad app is nearly useless. Difficult and frustrating to navigate, especially when trying to get flight information. Cute pages and images, but these don't help when you can't navigate back or start over. I have to shut down the app completely to get out of it. Not intuitive at all, which is usually the hallmark of Apple apps. Luckily the iPad can handle web pages and I'll stick with the website.

 (Terrible) I have typed in the exact address near where I need to find a hotel. It doesn't work and for some reason keeps wanting me to stay in San Francisco when I keep typing in Sacramento...Strange and a complete waste of time. Don't bother getting this app.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-17 3
 (Useful so far!!) Will try it out later for real for my boyfriends birthday ... We need a private place o_o

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-17 1
 (Anti-customer marketing) Expedia advertises this application on websites that hijack your phone's web browser and send you to the App Store without any confirmation. This is insulting and makes the whole experience of shopping with Expedia a complete negative in my view. I hope they reconsider this form of advertising in the future.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-16 3
 (Just a bit of advice???) If there isn't already is there a way you guys can implement a way to add a column where I can also search for Cruise information... I really would much rather use my app than log on to my laptop... Hotels/Flights/Cruises :) just a thought

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-15 2
 (Useless "coupon") As with many other reviewers, I got the app to try to use the coupon; naturally, any hotels I would have used it for were excluded. App itself worked well, but offering a coupon that's all but useless is classic bait and switch, shady and annoying.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-15 1
 (Duped and tricked like most others here) I was never given an opportunity to enter a promo code. My card was charged after a couple fields of questions. Full price charged in the blink of an eye. Customer loss in the blink of an eye. Can't believe they would risk their reputation like that.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-15 5
 (Incredible. Great for on the go travel) With the exclusive mobile only deals and easy to use intuitive app, Expedia truly is my go to app for hotels.

 (Help) Same problem as #24 review. App is stuck in App Store and can't update any apps. Terrible.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-14 1
 (Difficult) The app is not intuitive. No easy way to clear all fields and start entire search over, I was searching for one way tickets than it would not let me switch to roundtrip when I switched my search criteria. No way to choose a child ticket.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-13 2
 (Frustrating) Well, if you read other reviews, there are a few truths to be noted.  The $25 mobile coupon is pretty much a joke… way too many exclusions to be useful.

Searching is not very instinctive, and pretty difficult to navigate at times.  Normally I would research my trips on the website, and apply what I've learned to my mobile purchase, but unfortunately you won't have access to your Expedia scratchpad from the app.  Very counter-productive.

Also, I noticed that the prices I find on the website don't usually match the prices noted in the app.  Why?

Expedia (in general) is going to lose their reputation as a one-stop-shop for travel unless they make some serious improvements.  I have to double-check every hotel rate and plane route/price they give me.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-13 1
 (Mobile25 nope) Coupon code didn't work on my trip to NY I'm trying to book for five days. Guess expedia thinks ill just book it anyways, but I guess I'll be booking through Orbitz

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-13 2
 (Multi City Flights Not An Option) The app is easy to use and fluid, but signing into your account is inconvenient and having to reset your search criteria every time you search is a downright nuisance. The inability to search for multi-city flights renders this app completely useless for anyone not flying round-trip. Save yourself the frustration and use Expedia on a desktop!

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-13 5
 (Not) Not good

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-13 1
 (Too much aggravation for $25 coupon) Not intuitive, not as many sort options as the site, gives vague error messages. Deleting this app now that I got my $25 off!

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-13 1
 (Crap) Terrible app

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-12 1
 (Totally useless) If you want to use Expedia, jut go to website from your browser, useless app.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-12 1
 (Expedia $25 coupon a scam) Expedia tricks you with the $25 coupon to download the app.  Many major hotel chains are excluded.  If you read the conditions first it clearly tells you that.  But I am one of the many people who are trusting and I didn't read the conditions first.  I'm sure Expedia is counting on that.  Shouldn't give business to companies that deceive people.

 (SCAM coupon) Don't download for the coupon. It's a total scam. Literally every hotel you could possibly think of booking is listed on the non-eligible hotels list for the coupon. It's just a sham to get you to download the app.

 (Don't download this app for a hotel discount!) Very disappointed with this app.  I was surfing the web on my laptop for a hotel for an upcoming weekend out of town.  When I came across the Expedia page, a pop up offered a discount if I downloaded the app and booked through that.  So I clicked on that and entered my mobile number.  I received a text with a link to the app and downloaded from there, chose my hotel, and entered the requested information.  I was asked for my security code from the back of my credit card, then all of a sudden my reservation was confirmed. There was no final review, no confirmation button, and never the option to enter my discount code.  I called right away and spent 10 minutes on the phone to find out that I needed to start an "account" with Expedia to use this discount, which was never offered as an option on the app, and then that I couldn't use the discount with the hotel I had chosen - again that information was not provided while using the app.  Now I have been on hold another 15 minutes - still waiting - to cancel.  Not happy with the app or Expedia's customer service right now.  Definitely a bait and switch.  If they encourage you to use their app, they need to make sure that all important information is included when booking.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-05 1
 (No iPad ui for booking flights) Was it a joke to release this app without proper ui for searching for flights?

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-05 5
 (Hack) Did this for flappy bird

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-05 1
 (Mobile Coupon Farce) So I admit, one of the main reasons I decided to give this app a try was because of the coupon offer, $25 off your first booking of $100 or more. I took the bait. Attempted to apply the coupon to a reservation priced at $107 dollars, and guess what, it didn't work. If I'm going to pay full price, I'd rather give it to another company rather than one that pulls the old bait & switch. Hello Orbitz!

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-04 1

 (Useless) This iPhone App seems to be totally useless.  Once I navigated away from my itinerary all I can see is pretty pictures of various destinations.  There seems to be no way to get back to the beginning where I was. I've tried every button and icon I see and I've even tried closing the App and it just reopens to the same place. If I was standing at the airport counter trying to find my itinerary it would be a catastrophe.

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-03 5
 (Great app!) cheap prices and fast

Version 3.5.3 2014-02-02 1
 (Lipstick on a pig) I was excited when I first opened the app. The design, flow, integrations were are done super well and I was about to give it 5 stars... Then I tried to actually use the app. Signing in with Facebook made me link accounts, and linking account hang. When I tried to go around the login and just enter the itinerary code for my flight it wouldn't let me copy paste the info in the app! 13+ digits to remember from an email on the device.... Not a chance. So basically using the app is useless for me other than finding flight which I already use Kayak for. Fail.

Version 3.5.3 2014-01-31 1

 (For those that can't afford an assistant.) Hello,

I don't really write to
many reviews however, this little app saved my skin several times during my trip. First it reminded me that I could check-in 24-30 hours prior to, which ensured my family sat together on the plane and, coupled with the car rental it was seamless. The car rental direction option really saved my bacon because the rental cars GPS malfunctioned and the app
on my iPhone in tandem with maps of course lead me right to the parking spot
for the rental. This app was really well thought out and, I was an Expedia fanboy before however, this just brought it all together for me. Thank you Expedia.com, you put the planning in the back ground and reserved that time for whats important and , in my case it was the utilization  of every moment of family time.

Very Respectfully,

J. P.

 (Needs a little work!!) I would like to see this app have more functionality line the website. Every time I want to update my current quote I have to redue the entire process. It's frustrating because an app is supposed to make searching the same if not easier than the website. It doesn't need all the flair as much as it needs more functionality.

Version 3.5.2 2014-01-26 4
 (Beautiful app . . . but) It is a very nice looking app, and works fairly well, but it has a glitch that I could find no way to report.  I booked three different cars, and even though the Expedia, and Enterprise sites both say I rented a Midsized SUV, the app says I rented a Midsized Car.

Version 3.5.2 2014-01-26 5
 (Easy-Peasy, quick and best prices) Add to that they have great coupon codes you can apply!

 (bad) can only search within 10 miles? horrid. using booking.com and hopefully it will be better.

update: not sure if expedia prices are better, but the booking.com app is much better!! you have a lot more to search with and filters. expedia's app is so horrid it makes me cringe.

Version 3.5.2 2014-01-25 3
 (Not perfect) Tried to use Expedia app to book flight tickets.  For number of travelers, the app does not allow to put in children.  There is a difference in ticket price between adult and children tickets. Need to correct this bug.

 (App quotes higher prices than pc browser) Searching the same flights on a PC web browser will quote prices approximately $100 lower than when using this app.    I have tested this three times over the past three days. The same flights appear from both access points in parallel searches, but all prices are $100 higher from the app.

I just signed in, selected select my stay dates, hotel and credit card and zip completed. 

5 minutes later I called the hotel to ask a question and they confirmed my reservation was already set. Will be using expedia in the future for all reservations. 

Once you make a reservation, you app automatically provides you will all in the info you need off it.

 (Needs fixing) I use Expedia for all my travel reservations. It's nice to have this App on the go but it needs lots of fixing such as going back to trips, choosing dates (highlighting the dates scrolling down the calendar isn't very convenient), I couldn't find a way to look at multiple destinations travel, it doesn't update flight status as I hoped ( I had a flight last week delayed 3h and didn't receive any updates). Still it's convenient to have if it did everything the commercials say it does. I'm looking forward for the updates

 (Lame) This app has been around for quite a while now.  Still can't book hotel and flight on the same search.  Even more laughable, you gotta use the iPhone version to book a flight.  Seriously, it's not like they don't know how to put it all together or like they aren't making any money to invest in it, or like writing software is something only a few rare individuals can do.  This is just a cheesy half hearted attempt.

 (Not good anymore) Has been on my phone for over a year working well except for the last two months: when opened it goes to a black blank screen and STAYS there until closed. I have reinstalled the latest version three times. It works fine for about six openings then freezes again. I am very disgusted since Expedia said this was fixed. I use this site on my desktop all the time.

 (Misleading $25 credit) Don't waste your time trying to use the credit: they will not honor it. I spent 25 minutes trying to get this advertised credit applied to a new hotel reservation and after all that time, they would only credit toward the NEXT reservation. Use travelocity!!!

Version 3.5.2 2014-01-04 1
 (Broken promise right off the bat) The website promised a $25 discount the first time I booked with the app. But when I entered the code I was given it said it couldn't be applied. That's BS!

 (No way to get back to Trips) Looks slick, but can't get back to trips once you going into the Expedia spinner. Renders the app useless and downright frustrating. Correction: I was able to get back to my trips by completely quitting the app and reopening it. Now I get the overlay that allows one coming back to trips. Dinging it for the bug and for lack of useful information about airports and weather.

For flights, there is a link for driving directions between origin and destination cities. That probably comes in handy about once every 5000 flights. Even if this were useful and they wanted to keep it attached to the flight, you also get driving directions whenever you click on the more information arrow on the airport. Better would be  weather info for relevant arrival and departure times for that airport. 

App's support link from the app store only takes you to their general support site. Nothing specific to the app… How many developers make this mistake?

 (Never again!) I downloaded this just to warn everyone of expedias terrible business practices. Expedia is one of the most indifferent and illegitimate travel companies when it comes to customer service. They have given my entire family the run around for 3 days now, including disconnecting us, and telling us they will call us back and then never following through. All our family wants is to be recognized as human beings and to see some effort from the company. After being ignored for this long we will never use Expedia again, and furthermore will let our friends and colleagues know of our terrible experience. All you had to do was show some humanity.

 (Charged a higher rate than advertised- no customer service to change it) We were quoted a rate total that very clearly stated it included taxes. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that they had to charge the taxes and to call Expedia. Expedia admitted they had the wrong information on the site but said there was nothing they could do. RIDICULOUS. If you made the mistake, I shouldn't be the one paying for it. I will not use this app again as I don't trust the service now

Version 3.5.2 2013-12-22 2
 (No AmEx support and multiple rooms) I wasn't able to use the app to book 2 rooms!! I entered 4 guests but app won't let me split it into 2 guests per room.
Also I tried using my Amex card and app kept asking me to enter the cvv on the back of the card but the done button won't activate until I enter a 4th digit. Thinking it's a 4 digit validation for Amex, I entered the code on the front of the card but the app won't accept it and the cars auth kept failing .

Oh yeah I can't book hotel and flight together with this smart app as well, let alone other options.. 

Dumb app!!

 (Worst customer service experience ever) I downloaded the app, I think it looks great, process flow to book a flight was easy enough, just one small issue...I got booked on the wrong flight!!!!  I called to try and get it fixed and guess what, for a $200 change fee and the difference in fare they can rebook me. It just so happens those fees cost more than the original ticket. Safe to say that is the last penny Expedia will ever see for me. Horrible!!!

 (Terrible) I have no idea how this app rates so well. I constantly get an error message telling me my requests have timed out. I get this on my iPhone, my iPad, on wi-fi and on 3G.

 (Brilliant) Fantastic app 10/10

 (Z) ..

Version 3.5 2013-11-26 2
 (Missing functionality and no warnings!) The app shows different prices then the ones shown on the website, it doesn't allow you to choose when to pay for a hotel(immediately or on check in) and it doesn't warn you about those things too. The login experience is terrible and there is no option to modify your account via the app.

Otherwise, it is usable and the GUI is nice and smooth.

I would give a five star rating if they fix the aforementioned problems.

 (I don't normally write reviews...) I don't normally write reviews... But when I do, I give them 2 stars. However, this app stole my heart. It has an amazing, simple, and modern design. It was easy as 1, 2, 3 to buy a plane ticket and gave me unobtrusive hotel option in case of an emergency. Do not waste your time with Orbitz or Travelocity! I wasted a lot of money with Orbitz, and I saved hundreds with Expedia. Thank you for getting me to my family! Easy 5 star rating from me.

 (So helpful!!!!) On our recent international holiday, the Expedia App continued to alert me with important info such as when we could check in for our flights, upgrades to our seats and even when our flight was delayed. Very impressed with the app!!!

Version 3.5 2013-11-23 4
 (Good content, needs better filtering options) App is great. It's beautiful and quick. It was very easy to book my hotel. I used the map view to pick my hotel. After booking, the add to passbook is great and it has many sharing options. The only feature lagging was filtering based on user rating and price.

 (Finejustfine) This is a good app!!!!!!

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-22 1
 (Not for a busy/experience traveler) I am an Expedia Elite member, as I book over 350 rooms a year on my account. This app runs very poorly and has a lot of user issues. Other than the fact that about 30% of my bookings on here don't go through there are many other problems. My main problem is that you can't book multiple rooms at a hotel at a time. I book at least 3 rooms per night on tour (as a band) and I have to use the app 3 times for each night (at minimum, since it often doesn't go through). I love the deals on Expedia but they need to put some money and time into their app or get quicker phone service (as I often have to call in about app issues).

Version 3.5 2013-11-21 5
 (Nice) Lol cool places

Version 3.5 2013-11-21 5
 (Visually appealing!!) Fantastic availability on expedia sites!

Version 3.5 2013-11-20 5
 (Best travel app out there!) Love every part of this app. Real time notifications are probably the coolest feature. It even tells you when your gate has changed!

Version 3.5 2013-11-20 1
 (Garbage!) So Counterintuitive.  Their web page works just fine.  On this worthless app you cannot figure out how to combine a flight with hotels, and cars for that matter.  Sorry for the disaster in the Philippines, but this is a crap Filipino product.

Version 3.5 2013-11-20 3
 (Good... But) The app is super easy to navigate and user friendly.  However, the app does not have the function to search for hotel/flight vacation packages.

Version 3.5 2013-11-19 3
 (Fairly Good) But there is still room for improvement. Price offers are not the same as on the web. 
No matter what you select every time you have to log in again after starting the app.

Version 3.5 2013-11-19 5
 (Best app in travel, by far) Expedia has really knocked this one out of the park and I love the real time alerts!  I was sitting at the airport in Chicago and received a notice from Expedia that my flight was delayed, but the airline showed it was still on time.  Sure enough, five minutes later, American Airlines updated the gate info to show the delay, but Expedia's data was real time!

 (Does what it's supposed to do) This is good app for the ipad. I was able to see the same hotel and airfare availability as on the full internet site. 

The only issue I have is that the MOBILE25 coupon code does not apply to MANY if not ALL the hotels I can ever think of staying at! Where CAN you use this at? The fine print is so long with non-eligible hotels!

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-14 3
 (Needs more options) Meh, Kayak is a much better app. I wish we had the option (+/- 3 days) or something because I'll trying to find which day of departure would be the cheapest but this app requires me to KNOW when I want to leave

Version 2.1 2013-11-14 1
 (Full of lies.) Don't waste your time and money. The forgot to book my reservation, so I had to got to another hotel. Asked for my money back, and they said it was impossible. Also: after comparing directly with the hotel, the "special quote" they "found" for me was exactly the same as the one of the hotel.

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-14 1
 (Good for nothing) This app is good for nothing. The website is a thousand times better than the app.

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-13 3
 (It does its job) Cool

Version 3.3 2013-11-13 2
 (If you download it to get the new user discount ....) Don't forget to watch for a place to enter the coupon code. I generally prefer booking travel on my computer, but got this app specifically to use the coupon mentioned in the description. I never saw a place to enter the coupon code, but the app said something like "the price just went down" so I thought that maybe that was the discount. Not so! Only after I'd booked my hotel did I realize that I got the same price as on the web. And I can't figure out how to complain.

This smacks of bait & switch.

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-13 1
 (App Crashes) Since the last update, the App crashes on my iPhone 4S. I hear the iPhone 4 is affected by the same issue as well. 

It had been a couple of weeks now and Expedia has not fixed this. Please do something. Otherwise you will be losing a lot of business. 

The only reason I did not give it zero stars is that it is not possible.

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-11 5
 (Good app) Loved it

 (Nice) Nice easy way

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-10 3
 (Nice app but no good for business travelers) When I got this app I was very impressed with the user interface and ease of use. But there are three things that make it unhelpful for frequent flyers:
1. The name of every itinerary is "Mobile". If you book several flights you can't see which is which. 
2. You can not enter your frequent flyer number - even when it is available on your profile. You have to go into the web version to add in your FF number. If you forget, you will miss upgrades and points.
3. The app only does round trips or one-ways. You can not set up a multi-step itinerary.

If expedia can solve these three problems and I will give it 5 stars.

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-04 5
 (Great app!) It's so easy to use, love how it automatically begins hotel searches in my current location.

Version 3.3 2013-11-04 1
 (Update mess) After the update for Apple iOS7, Which I refuse to do, Your app got deleted from my iPhone And iPad! I tried to reload it and it says there is an earlier version available to me. When I go to load it won't! What's the use of having an app that doesn't work with all versions!

Version 3.3 2013-11-04 4
 (Love it) This app is great , customer service not so good though.

Version 3.4 2013-11-04 1
 (Buyer beware of booking hotels, flights, etc on Expedia) Expedia is lousy at customer service.  Using expedia creates a situation where neither the hotel or airline claims responsibility for mistakes.  For instance...I just booked a room in Hong Kong.  The date was changes.  I had to rebook my accommodations but neither the hotel nor Expedia would credit me for the incorrectly booked night.

Best to find prices using Expedia or other and then book directly with hotel or airline.

Good luck!

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-04 3
 (Expedite) Very resourceful app!

 (Single room and booking) Does not allow for multiple rooms or more than one location to be booked in a single transaction. 
If you need more than one room at the same location then use the webpage or call customer service but no guarantee you can use the app discount code to reserve.

Version 3.4.1 2013-11-03 1
 (Was a fun until app made me miss my flight!!!!!!!!!) I used to love this app. Checked my app last night for flight info and it gave me a 9:28am departure time. Turns out my flight really left at 8:48am. I will never trust this app again.

 (Can't add a toddle to the list) I'm wonder the person who made this app if he likes kids or Not because I can't book my 1 year old this app is useless I can only choose people no kids what's with THAT?

Version 3.4.1 2013-10-30 1
 (NO GOOD!!) Ever since this latest update version was installed on my iPhone, I can't open the app!! It just keeps crashing and closing itself. Won't be booking too many hotels or flights with an app that won't stay open, Expedia!!!

Version 3.4.1 2013-10-30 3
 (Meh) It's ok

Version 3.4.1 2013-10-29 1
 (App discount) I used this app because it advertised I would get 25% off at booking but there was never an option to input discount code.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND!

Version 3.4.1 2013-10-26 5
 (Great app for last minute reservation) We were on our way home to CA from Seattle, and didn't feel we could make it in one day. So I pulled up the Expedia App.

 In minutes  I found a great hotel at a great price. It was fast and easy.

Version 3.4.1 2013-10-26 1
 (Won't open) Tries to open. Fails every time.

Version 3.4.1 2013-10-25 1
 (Beware) Interface is pretty but app had some kind of bug on my iPad that kept changing the default date, and did it again when I booked my hotel room. Be careful or you'll end up spending your whole vacation on hold with customer service... Who were unhelpful and no one could solve the problem.

 (Download doesn't work) Ever since its release on 20 October, I have been trying to install the new version.  I keep getting an error saying the download failed.

 (Not working) This app keeps telling me I have the wrong security code for my credit card when I'm looking straight at it and can see that it is correct. I've been trying all day and have missed seats on three different flights because it won't take the info I'm putting in, even though it's right. Super frustrated.

 (Great app) I love this app, but I just wanted to say the new "flat" pins on the map look terrible. They might go with the overall iOS7 aesthetic, but not the map they are depicted on.

Version 3.4 2013-10-04 1
 (Crap, useless app) They not only changed the UI to be completely unintuitive, but even if I manage to figure out where to find my trips, I am unable to view my itinerary on the iPhone.

What's more, there is absolutely no way to add your itinerary to the calendar.  What kind of iOS app doesn't interact with your calendar???  I'm sure they want me to just open the app every time I need to check something, and provide them with my location, and other usage information.

It may be a pretty app, but it is useless if you need to take a class to learn how to use, or if it doesn't support the most common use cases.

 (Not even worth it) The app does not even search for flights for all available airlines. Very limited choices (in my case only uses 1 airline). I would rather check every individual airline site for bookings. Waste of time really

 (Fastest way to book travel on a phone) This app is so beautiful and easy to use. I have my account set-up on Expedia.com so I just sign in and the app fills out all my travel and payment details. I can literally book a flight or hotel in under 30 seconds!

Version 3.3 2013-09-27 5
 (Great aesthetics, UI) Easy to use and helpful.

Version 3.2 2013-09-27 5
 (Best Travel App on iOS) Best Travel App in the App Store.  Impressive UI and relevant Hotel Search made it very easy to book a Hotel in Grants Pass Oregon at 11pm on a random Friday evening.  Kudos!

Version 3.4 2013-09-27 5
 (Taking Travel Up a notch) This is a beautiful and inspiring app which makes searching for hotels and flights fun and easy. I love the way details of the trips I book show up on the app when i need them and getting notifications about flight check in , gate info and changes is incredibly useful

Version 3.4 2013-09-27 1
 (Prices are not consistent with website) I researched the exact same flight, times and location, on both the mobile app and website. Thankfully I did this since there was a drastic difference in prices that I was quoted. The website showed the flight for $446 while the app showed the flight for $739. I don't know how this drastic of a difference could be possible since they are both maintained by "Expedia." This makes me mistrust this app completely and will NEVER use it to book trips. I appreciate the look and ease of the app, but having correct information is WAY more important.

Version 3.4 2013-09-26 1
 (Terrible app. Lacks features. Slow.) Made a reservation tonight for a hotel room -- or thought I did. 3 hours later still no confirmation and the app just spins and spins trying to find my itinerary. No confirmation email and the itinerary number is both associated withy account and not associated with my account according to the web site and app. 

-site content and reservations not sync'd with web site
-can't reserve a car (?!)
-can access basic site features related to account
-itinerary feature useless. Can't display reservations made

Certainly it is pretty. But it doesn't work.

 (Expedia) If you are serious about air travel use another app. For hotels, perhaps OK.

Version 3.4 2013-09-25 3
 (Missing Passbook integration) Still needs Passbook integration so I can keep my Expedia itineraries with everything else. One workaround is to use Kayak's app, but it would be nice if that weren't necessary.

 (Won’t Show Itineraries) I have tried to use this app for the past 2 months. I have a trip coming up and had hoped to store my itinerary in the app.
When I go to “Trips” I can see that I have a flight and a car reserved on the 9th. When I click either one for more details it opens an “Additional Information” page that then says “No Itineraries Found.”
I tried the website (the mobile version), it has the same error.
I tried accessing the full website; I can see the link for my itinerary, but as I click it I am taken to the mobile site that then says “No Itineraries Found.”
Each comes with a “Connection Error   Update Failed” error on the top. 
I was hoping the iOS7 update would have fixed this, but it hasn’t. Until this is fixed, it is a useless app for me and will be deleted.

Version 3.3 2013-09-23 1
 (Pointlessly only supports iOS 7) The app pointlessly dropped support for iOS versions less than 7 for no real reason, and a poorly designed iOS 7-like interface isn't a good reason...

Version 3.4 2013-09-23 3
 (Need more filters) This is the only travel app I have that does not let you filter what you want. Unless you just need the straight up basic, in some kind of hurry. This app is lacking.

Version 3.3 2013-09-23 3
 (okay) not perfect yet but good enough

Version 3.2 2013-09-23 1
 (Terrible) All five stars are from the developers, this is a horrible app!

Version 3.4 2013-09-22 1
 (Treated customers unfairly) Recently I had to cancel a vacation and they would not even consider a refund or a partial refund. There should have been some form of option when I made the reservation to safeguard against emergencies. I lost over $1500. 
I suggest when booking vacations you book directly with the hotel because many of times they are more considerate to such changes. You will also not have to work through a middleman when you need to make a change. 
Expedia is not worth the risk. It's always a pain in the end. Go direct.

Version 3.2.2 2013-09-22 5
 (Ok) Ok

Version 3.4 2013-09-21 1
 (No thank you) Horrible app, terrible company, all lies, skip it. You will thank me

 (Love it!) Awesome App!!

Version 3.3 2013-09-21 5
 (Quick and easy) I've used Expedia.Com a lot for plane tickets. I thought I'd try the app out. There was one minor hiccup - the app defaulted to using expedia.co.uk, and it wasn't immediately obvious that this was the problem, or how to solve it (find the settings, and change location to the correct expedia site for you). Their help was quick and friendly when I questioned it.

Anyway, I've just booked a hotel, and let me tell you, it was MUCH better than the experience I had booking a place with TripAdvisor. I don't know if the deal is much better or worse, but it was almost effortless to do it, which counts for a lot in my mind.

Version 3.3 2013-09-21 5
 (Coole App) Lohnt sich!

Version 3.2.2 2013-09-20 5
 (Super helpful) I loved having this app on my phone when I flew. It kept me up to date on my flight in real time.

Version 3.4 2013-09-20 4
 (Great app, but not perfect) I do really enjoy this app, but it is NOT as good as the website. Specifically, it doesn't have as many features and options for filtering. 
I'd also like more options for seeing WHERE a hotel is, as in specific location. 
If that all was as complete it would be perfect!

Version 3.3 2013-09-05 1
 (Beware of Hidden Transaction Fees) I like the app but when purchasing airline tickets Expedia added a fee that was hidden unless you knew where to look.  When I called the support center in India, I was told they were sorry and couldn't do anything about their fees.  I won't use Expedia for airline tickets again.  It's smarter to use the airline sites and you don't have to pay added Expedia fees.

 (Great for road trips!) We were driving on the road, not sure how long we will go for the day. By noon we decided that it's probably good to stop when the sun goes down, so I checked the map for a decent-sized town for that distance, used the  Expedia app to find a hotel that received good ratings, checked the reviews and checked the price, and book it! Ultimate useful tool on the road.

Version 3.2.2 2013-08-19 1

We checked in room smelled musty & moldy and it was hot. we asked about air conditioning they said there's nothing wrong with it would we like a fan. We asked what temperature is it set at he refused to say. The pictures in hotel profile are not accurate. Also woke up to use the bathroom and found the biggest roach in the planet. Also to go to the beach they cleaned our room and took the towels and I asked to bring me towels to go to beach and I was told Towels not permitted to take beach. The final straw was I went to get ice for cooler and was told no Ice for cooler. I gave it a 1 star it a deserves -1 star if that's even possible.

 (Well) It is is 2013 the app should have an "add to passbook" option if you want Expedia to make the extra mile towards user friendliness ~ I see no reason why other apps include the passbook option and Expedia does not. Besides that, well designed interface.

The tv kept freezing up and didn't work half the time. The room smelled like cigarettes. Im not 100% sure the bed was clean. carpet was dirty. It was an awful stay. Do not stay there.

 (Missing information) Nice app, easy to use and book, however it failed to mention anywhere that the hotel had a resort fee of $15. The hotel kindly offered to waive the fee, but they shouldn't have to. The information should be clearly presented. I stay in Vegas a lot and know many of the hotels have this fee, but some don't and as there was no mention of it, I presumed it was one that didn't.

Or concerns.  I rate this place a negative star but I have to say 1 star or I can't submit my comments

Version 3.2 2013-07-18 3
 (Flight search not working) The app's mostly great, with a nice UI and good hotel search, but flight search stalls at the loading screen (at least on the iPhone 4). I left to load for about five minutes with a strong Wi-fi signal, but it stayed at the loading screen, and the app has never gotten past that loading screen. Fixing this problem would make the app perfect!

Version 3.2 2013-07-17 1
 (Terrible) I booked flights through this service to my own chagrin. The account services is confusing as my iPad indicates I booked as a guest but the app won't allow me to search by itinerary. Should be simple instead it's arduous. Junk app.

Version 3.2 2013-07-16 5
 (Useful App) It's nice having all my itineraries in one spot and not having to worry about when check in time starts with the automatic app notifications.

Version 3.2 2013-07-16 3
 (Slow) Helpful when it works, most of the time it takes forever to search, and sometimes it just errors and gives no result.

Version 3.2 2013-07-16 1
 (Worthless) Don't use this app unless you like wasting money

Version 3.2 2013-07-15 1
 (How the Heck Does it Work??) App is very frustrating. I can't figure out how it works. I logged in to my acct and tried to add an itinerary. Said I need to log into my acct, shows I already am logged in, circle continues..... How the heck do you navigate this thing? There are no icons or options. I am very frustrated and will go ahead and delete now.... Useless and aggravating!!

Version 3.2 2013-07-12 5
 (Great app!) I love the new itinerary feature on the Expedia app! It was super handy on my last business trip when I didn't do much planning or research beforehand. The app told me all my flight information, and then when I arrived to my destination it gave all of my hotel information, including directions and contact information.

I'll be using this every time I travel from now on!

 (Best travel app) Love this app, highly recommend to all travelers.

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-12 5
 (Intuitive and easy to use!) It's the little things that make this app stand above the rest of the hotel apps. Everything from the accelerometer enabled door hanger, the sale/discount indicators in the hotel results scroll bar and the ability to auto-fill contact details using my phone's address book when booking a hotel. This app rocks!

Version 3.2 2013-07-12 5
 (Great App) Exactly what I needed!

Version 3.2 2013-07-12 1
 (Incomplete) The idea is good but This app is incomplete. It's like a work in progress, there's a lot of features missing. I tried to book 3 hotel rooms and I had to do it individually.(one by one); this is very time consuming. i spent a lot of time figuring out the option for hotel instead of having a single icon to click. It should be more user friendly.

Version 3.2 2013-07-11 3
 (Hotel in San Antonio) I was traveling with my family to Kerrville. While on the road we decided to stay in San Antonio. Expedia showed us some deals. We picked The St. Anthony hotel. It is under renovation, so it has some flaws. It was not too bad for one night. We could enjoy the River Walk but there were hidden fees: $20 parking in the park or $26 valet parking in hotel. They should tell the whole story upfront.

Version 3.2 2013-07-11 5
 (Best travel app on the market) Now that Expedia has finally added the ability to check your itinerary in this app, it's truly useful.  It's also stunningly beautiful, which makes for a very pleasant experience when using it!

Version 3.2 2013-07-11 1
 (This app is no Bueno) This app is useless if you want to actually book anything. Tried to book a flight with card saved, no connection, entered a card, no connection. I'm now on the phone starting over. 15 mins and counting on the phone, not to mention the 15 mins I wasted on the app trying to get it to work. Please test your app before you release it.

Version 3.2 2013-07-11 5
 (Beautiful Travel App) Great travel app, love the itinerary capability.  Has all the information I need while on the go.  Thanks Expedia.

 (Doesn't show the lowest fares) I checked out the Expedia website for airfares. The lowest for my itinerary was $348, of which there were several options. The app looked more convenient so I downloaded it and ran the same search. The lowest fare through the app was on a different airline, and was $50 more.  Through the app, there was no sign of the lower fares shown on the website. I went back to the website, and ran the search yet again and got the same results as the first time. The app is getting deleted.

Version 3.2 2013-07-09 1
 (Good) Trollllllll

Version 3.2 2013-07-08 1
 (Nice App Buuutttt..............) Very slick app but beware of getting baited with a cheap price and switched at the end of transaction with higher price charged to your credit card.

Version 3.2 2013-07-08 1
 (NO RENT A CAR??) WHEN are you going to make this a FULL Service App and add Rent A Car providers and bookings so users can book their Complete and Entire travel package? Can I rate you a ZERO until then?

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-08 1
 (Run far away) This is the worst app. As if booking flights and hotels wasn't stressful enough this app takes it to a whole new level! Not only does it take one thousand years to find the specific hotel you're looking for, despite the fact that you ENTERED THE EXACT ADDRESS, it also won't let you use any coupon codes, just for the hell of it. Unless you like the urge to literally smash your iPhone against a glass wall and feel the shards of glass slice open your limbs.... DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-08 5
 (I love it!!!) Best Western hotel was clean and Friendly. Great breakfast as well I loved it

 (This app is awsome) This app is good for this summer

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-05 5
 (Great App!!) Easy to use! Love it!

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-04 1
 (Coupon deceiving) Only certain hotels qualify (prepay Expedia hotels) for the $25 off discount advertised when you sign up. This app does not tell you which hotels qualify which is a glitch within the app itself. After speaking to 2 different Expedia representatives, they admitted that there was a glitch and reported it but would not honor the coupon code even though it was their mistake. Decided to cancel the reservation and go with another company. FYI- Priceline had my same hotel room for $7 cheaper nightly rate. App is user friendly but worthless when company behind it does not honor it. Will not use Expedia again!

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-04 3
 (Ok, major flaw) Beautiful and easy to use, but no way to book flights and hotel as a package. Major flaw.

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 1
 (Terrible) Every time I try to book a hotel, the app crashes and I can't have a cheap, memorable vacation

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 5
 (Perfect app for travellers) This app just works perfectly when you needed it, can only recommend. Quick, easy to use and responsive! I just live it and would recommend to all out there! The passbook save of reservations is a great addition, thanks!

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 5
 (Super Smooth!) Can't imagine any improvements. Very cool.

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 3
 (Unkept Deals) The app itself works great; I have no complaints about that. I however feel pretty scammed after seeing that I could supposedly receive $25 off my first $100+ booking but the having the coupon code fail to deliver. I thought at first it might be a glitch with site, but after seeing other reviews detailing the same problem I realized it's a hoax. Nice, Expedia.

Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 5
 (La mejor app del mundo...!!!!) Es increible esta aplicacion en 3 sencillos pasos tienes todo la busqueda muy simple, la sescripcion y el pago en dos pasos..... La mejor aplicacion del mundo para reservas....  Diafrutenla....!!!!

 (Love it!) Love, love, love this App! I do a lot of leisure travel and this app makes booking super convenient and they offer great discounts.  I all really prefer the mapping functions on the app vs the website.  Excellent and I'm looking forward to using it during my travels.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-30 5
 (Best hotel searches) This app is great for finding hotels near your destination point.  The map is very helpful.  Full color photos and lots of reviews to help you find just what your looking for.

 (OK) Maybe I'm missing something, but you can't search air & hotel as a package.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 4
 (Best hotel app) This is by far the best hotel app.  If you have an Expedia account, it makes it extremely simple and quick to find, look and pay for a room anywhere.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 5
 (Sweet) Easy to use and actually had prices lower than Kayak on a few searches.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 5
 (Awesome!) Works perfectly!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 4
 (Love it) Thankz expedia love this app!!!!!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 4
 (Easy from the start) Easy from the get go to use.  However, unless I didn't see it, I would love a filter allowing me to see only the hotels within the map view as I change it.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 1
 (Ugh) Keeps crashing!!!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-21 5
 (Great app!) We are a road trip, booking rooms as we go and this app is a lifesaver!!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-20 5
 (VERY WELL) this app is much more easy to use and very simple! highly recommended!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-19 5
 (Great app) Very easy to use

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-19 5
 (Superb) Super easy!!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-18 2
 (App fine, Tapjoy promotion flawed) Expedia advertised its app on Tapjoy with a 333 (quite large) bonus points.... But at least for me it failed to deliver.

+ App works fine for finding a location, a hotel.

- App does not provide / allow for government /military rate discounts

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-18 5
 (Excellent upgrade) Used the new app for the first time and pleasantly surprised.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-18 4
 (Frequent traveler) Easy to use and fast to book

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-18 5
 (Best traval app EVERE!!!!) Get this app!!!!!  It is aossome!!!!!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-17 5
 (Great!) Simplicity.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-16 5
 (So easy to use) I never wrote app reviews so this is my first time giving one because this newly designed app is so easy to use! Great UX, user flow, fast search results an the 20% off coupon code is a good incentive!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-16 5
 (Passbook support!) Booking a hotel took 5 minutes and with the easy integration with Maps, Passbook and Calendar, I won't have to go hunting down my email receipt. Awesome!

Version 3.1 2013-06-15 5
 (Awesome) Very nice and clean UI. Easy to use and to navigate. Great job Expedia!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-15 5
 (Love!) Very easy transactions and interactions with calendar. Love it!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-15 5
 (WOW) Amazing, very helpful and super user friendly... Great to count on these things on the go!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-15 5
 (Great) Awesome App! Easy to use! Especially on the go!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-14 5
 (Great app!) I used it and got an extra 20% off my stay by using the app!  Awesome!  I saved $100!

Version 1.5 2013-06-14 1
 (Terrible) Absolutely the worst.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-13 5
 (Awesome!) Works as it says, doesn't show you hotels that are full, and provides lots of details!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-12 5
 (Can't live without it! ☺) This app is amazing if you travel a lot✈
You can search and book hotels instantly! I love it and it makes my travels so much easier! 
Happy travels✌😊

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-12 5
 (AMAZING!!!) Incredibly intuitive...that got this app right!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-12 1
 (Meh...decent) Offers no advantages to the online site. Needs to be more optimized for mobile. If you really need a last-minute hotel room TONIGHT, then there are better apps

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-11 5
 (Best loading screen ever) I load up flight just to play with the loading screen

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-11 4
 (Great!) Easy to use and found the best price for the hotel we needed.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-10 5
 (Awesome!) This app is so much nicer than Travelocity's.  I tried both and deleted Travelocity's 5 minutes in to using this one.  As soon as they get flight features added to the iPad version it will be even better, but their fix in the meantime still works great! Nice animations and graphics, too.  It almost adds to the excitement of booking the trip itself!  Keep up the great work!

Version 3.0.3 2013-06-10 5
 (Keep up the good work') I use this app all the time. Best part about it is it just keeps getting better and easier over time.   Really intuitive interface with minimal learning curve time.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-09 5
 (Love this app, easier to book than on the computer!) Easy to use and makes the booking process so quick, it is not however the best tool for researching unknown properties or destinations.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-09 5
 (Awesome help) Easy to navigate and intuitive to use. Well done!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-09 4
 (Excellent!) Unable to find a hotel online, but this app found many.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-08 5
 (Thank you Expedia!) Oh my goodness Expedia is the all around and always best company to use for booking. Wether I go to another country or book hotels in the US- seriously!  The crap on the phone from the people on the phone is NO MATCH for the ease and trust of an online app from a company like Expedia. "Sorry sir there's nothing available..." We'll there was with Expedia! Do not call hotels or airlines for better rates! That's alway a bunch of crap when friends tell you to always do it, hell! - they never go anywhere why would you listen to them anyway?

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-08 5
 (Unbelievably amazing app) The user interface is crisper than any app I've used before. No delays, no waiting, asks for the right info at the right time and gets you a booking fast. I particularly loved the "swipe to purchase" at the end - more apps should do that. All in all wholly recommend.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-07 3
 (Ok, I guess....) Booked some airline tickets but it made me call Expedia and speak with someone to confirm every item!

Booked shoreline rooms, worked fine but the APP is now stuck on the Hotel confirmation page, no way to get back to the app. Maybe if I delete it?

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-07 4
 (Flight Count Down Suggestion) Make hours and minutes count down within 24 hours and make notification when 3 or 2 or 1 hour(s) left before the flight end.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-06 1
 (Don't be tricked by coupon offer) I have always used Expedia website to book my hotel needs. This time I saw that I could save 5% by downloading and using the mobile app before Dec 2013. So I did but app said coupon could not be applied.  Nice scam to get you to try the App.

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-05 5
 (This is insane) Using this app is faster than using my computer.. Best app, thank you

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-05 5
 (Such an improvement!!) So much better than the previous Expedia app, which just opened safari. Easy to use and creative imaging.

Version 3.0 2013-06-05 4
 (Elegant and functional) Great app!

Version 3.1.1 2013-06-04 5
 (Love it) It is the best

Version 3.1 2013-06-04 5
 (Awesome app!) This is a very useful app when booking on-the-go. I booked a hotel room & checked in a few minutes.

Version 3.1 2013-06-03 5
 (G) Tatty high meow kitten

Version 3.1 2013-06-03 5
 (Well developed) What a nice design for a online travel booking website! Easy to use as book your trip.

Version 3.1 2013-06-02 5
 (Great App!) Does everything I need WRT travel. Easy to use and intuitive.

Version 3.1 2013-06-02 5
 (Great!) Very best!  Easy to search!

Version 3.1 2013-06-02 5
 (Best ever app to see prices on Hotels) this app is amazing. It calculates how much a trip would cost depending on the amount of people going to Paris or any other country.

Version 3.1 2013-06-01 5
 (Great app for booking hotels and flights!) Awesome Deals!

Version 3.1 2013-06-01 5
 (Awesome App!) I love this app. I was able to download the app and book a hotel within a few minutes. I really like the map "pinpoint " location.  Expedia is the best travel booking option out there.

Version 3.1 2013-05-31 5
 (Great app!) Super easy to use. Almost like it better than the website.

Version 3.1 2013-05-31 1
 (Really?) Most of these reviews are obviously NOT for the iPad app. Adding Flights to iPad is not dropping in a fake iPhone on a cheesy background. Not sure how this qualifies as a Universal app.

Version 3.1 2013-05-31 5
 (Love Alerts!) The flight alerts and checkout reminders are great additions!

Version 3.1 2013-05-31 5
 (Excelente) Muy buena aplicación

Version 3.1 2013-05-29 5
 (Love Love Love!!) I am in love with this app. It is beautiful in design and the best part of all is the fact that it is so easy to use when it comes to last minute booking.

Version 3.1 2013-05-29 2
 (Eh) Not useful without an account, which you can't make on here

Version 3.1 2013-05-29 5
 (Congrats best ui I've ever seen) Very good app! What a experience using it. Just loved.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-28 2
 (Love the iPhone app- ipad app will only let me book hotels) The iPhone app is the easiest way to book flights, much easier then the website.

The ipad app will only let me look at hotels..Fix please!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-28 5
 (Expedia) Quick and painless. Couldn't ask for a more simple way to plan a trip

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-28 5
 (Great) I really like it

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-28 5
 (Expedia) great for traveling!!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-28 5
 (Unbelievably quick and easy) Actually faster than on the computer, once you have an Expedia profile. Superb.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-27 5
 (Booked NEEDED hotel in under 5 minutes) I was between flights and got a text that my party had booked his hotel where I was to meet him and I was able to get on, find, book, and confirm on my way to my next gate. BOOM......simply awesome.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-27 5
 (Easy, quick & user friendly!) This app was easy to search using the map and list features and helped us find what we were looking for. Easy as pie to book too! No logging in, filing out all kinds of info...really glad I used this!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-27 1
 (Useless for iPad) I have this app on my iPhone and it works well for booking flights, which is what I use it for.  On the iPad version, I can't book a flight, only a hotel. So, this app is useless to me. I hope and suspect that this is a developer problem and will be fixed in upcoming versions.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-27 5
 (Expedia App) So easy to book a hotel, looking for simple this is it!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-26 1
 (Can't book flights) Worthless. Deleted.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-24 1
 (Mr) Discount code for using App for the 1st time didn't work, reservation is done no discount. Don't think will do Expedia again

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-24 5
 (Great) Very useful for travelers

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-24 5
 (ااه) لا

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-23 1
 (Garbage) App is useless.  Why can't I see flights? I only see hotels. Junk.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-23 5
 (EASY to use, let the fingers do the clicking.) I use this app weekly to make my hotel reservations, it's great, very helpful and so easy to use.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-23 5
 (Helpful!) This is a very useful tool for any traveler!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-22 5
 (Travel) Good App, easy to use!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-22 5
 (Easy to use) This app makes it so easy to quickly make reservations and travel plans on the go.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-21 5
 (Fast and user friendly) Everything loaded fast, and was quick and seamless.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-21 4
 (Our stay.....) Our stay was pleasant, the deal was great & the service was excellent 😃 the hotel was clean & the beds were super comfy! No complaints at all!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-21 2
 (You can't bundle?) Isn't Expedia about saving more when you book flight, hotel, & car together? Yet you can't do that on the app? USELESS.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-21 1
 (Don't bother use the website) This version is not comparable with the website as far as flights go.  Website pulls up flights not found using this app.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-20 1
 (This app does NOT do flights!) The app is called Expedia Hotels and Flights but there is no way (it says its not supported yet) to search for flights!  I find this a little crazy since Expedia is known for flight searches and even more crazy because the name of the app literally has "Flight" in the title.  I hope this discourages enough people from downloading it to get their attention and fix this.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-20 1
 (No flight booking?) Why have an airplane in the logo when the iPad version won't let you book flights? Somebody in Quality Control needs to fix this.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-19 5
 (Awesome!) We made a last minute decision to spend the night in Palm Desert.  I saw this app and in less than 5 mins, found a hotel right around the corner from my family's home.  The bonus was the discounted rate we received for using the app.  This is a time saver to say the least, and does all the work for you!

Version 3.0 2013-05-18 5
 (Great app) I like how I can see all the hotels on a map, so I can see where they are all located in relation to each other and to points of interests that I would like to stay close to.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-18 1
 (Only books hotels, not flights) Useless

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-18 5
 (Awesome app!!) One of the very Coolest apps, I've used so far!! Excellent UI and very user friendly!

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-18 2
 ("Hotels and flights" but no flights??) Cannot search flights on the ipad app. Flights in the name and an airplane on the app. What??

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-18 1
 (No coupon code field) I only installed this app so I could use the 5% off coupon code MOBILEGO. However there's nowhere to enter the code! Someone screwed up.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-17 2
 (Not sure) What the deal is, it works on the iPhone but it does not work on iPad no can do flight searches on iPad then it is useless, on iPhone works but then you also have other options not sure what to think

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-17 5
 (Nice) Let me book a flight faster than actually going to the website. Good job Expedia!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-16 1
 (Not A Flight Search App) 1. Don't call the app a 'Flight Search' app... This is not supported in the iPad version... So take it out of the title and stop wasting our time.  
2. I always use Expedia, but now looking at Kayak because it can do flight search.

-Lost customer

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-15 5
 (Great experience) I spent a lot of time comparing hotel rates with other sites such as Priceline and Hotwire. Expedia had better prices on hotels and I found an excellent price.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-14 5
 (Great) Does everything i need to do. Book a hotel and a flight.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-14 1
 (No flight searches?!?!?) What's the use of a travel app that won't let you search flights? Huge glitch for the iPad version -- maybe the other versions work. Will delete (again!)

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-13 1
 (Worthless) Honestly I only downloaded this app for flights and you can't even search them on here. I'll be deleting this.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-12 1
 (Don't use this app) Recently used thus app to reserve a hotel room. The price shown and total given is not the amount I was charged. It was $20 more. Called Expedia and they were less then helpful. Don't trust this app.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-11 1
 (Awful) It won't go past searching for flights.... All it does is says "searching". Worthless.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-11 5
 (Love it!) This app is amazing at keeping track of my travel.  All my trips are saved and kept up to the minute with any changes or updates.  I still book my trips on the desktop version, but the app is great on the go!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-11 1
 (Car rentals?) Unless I missed the functionality, why can we rent cars on the web site and not on the app?

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-11 5
 (Traveler) Simple .. Easy ....fast

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-10 1
 (Horrible app) This is a horrible app. I wanted to book a hotel in Anaheim but i could only book one in places like Venice Italy or Miami Florida. This particular app wouldn't even let me search for Anaheim. I had to download a whole separate app because this one was worthless. It was a waste of data and a waste of my time. I won't be using Expedia again. This app or the site.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-10 5
 (Well-designed and effective) I use my mobile device for pretty much all web browsing now, which can be difficult at times with all the zooming in and out. This is especially true when doing things like trying to find a flight. It's usually painful. This app is great and convenient. I'm glad they took the time to make it and will use plenty in the future.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-10 5
 (Easy!) Connected with facebook ...Couldn't be easier!!

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-10 5
 (Great app!!!) Very user friendly!!! Highly recommend.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-09 1
 (worthless) can't book a flight and hotel at the same time.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-09 1
 (Horrible -- don't do it.) All it says is cant log into Facebook and  keeps recycling.  Installed then deleted, don't waste your data.

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-08 2
 (Can't pull up Itinerary#) I have a trip in the planning stages. The Itinerary exists on the web site, but I can pull it up from the app. It tells me I must be logged into the account associated with the itinerary (I am!!). So far the app is useless to me. Even if I could get to my own itinerary, what if I needed to see a companion’s itinerary?

Version 3.0.3 2013-05-08 5
 (Superb app!) Excellent app. You can in a snap book any hotel based on the location. Very recommended!

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-07 2
 (Wrong dates on app!) I booked a hotel from 24-26 and the app showed check in as 25th check out 26th!  How's that even possible to get wrong when they're using their own itinerary?! Crap app...two stars for the design of app but garbage if it doesn't display correct info.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-06 1
 (Can't book hotels and flights like you can on website) Useless app, can't book hotels and flights at the same time like you can on the website. Why companies don't have same functionality on their native apps as their websites is beyond me, what's the point of even having an app if it can't do what the web can? 0 stars if I could.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-06 5
 (Great app) Booked a hotel in NYC. Was super easy to find a hotel and book it. In fact, I found it even easier to use than the website. Great experience.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-06 4
 (Great App, Useful, Efficient) Worth getting.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-06 2
 (Not very good) Ok for looking at hotels but that's about it. Can't search flights. Don't really get the point of this app for travel.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-05 4
 (Great app) Wish I would've used this app a long time ago. I would've saved so much more money. Good hotels & most are a steal of a price.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-05 2
 (Shows wrong reservation date) Ok I about freaked out when the app showed my check in date as May 5th instead of May 4th. The itinerary was correct but app was wrong!!  No Bueno!

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-04 5
 (Bhunkus) Bahut bhankus

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-03 3
 (Flights are hard to book please change) I cannot book a flight and a car for some reason.  Not explained very well.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-03 1
 (Broken) Keeps crashing

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-03 5
 (Its a super App !) Exellent options of use this app helped me a lot. :)
Im sure its going to become popular !

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-03 1
 (Impossible to select dates that span between months!) Tried to book a flight departing one month returning another and it is impossible.  The date selection is clever but it does not seem to work well.   I see a lot of people booking things incorrectly because of this.  This is very bad.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-03 1
 (Great app until you book) Great app until you book.  Put all my info in including my debit card, but app kept telling me to fix my card info.  But it was correct!!  Had to log on through their website and book.  Grrrrr!  Worth 0 stars if you can't book!

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-02 2
 (Flights?????) No explanation on how to search for flights.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-02 1
 (BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) I booked six tickets from Seattle to Hawaii through Expedia.  It was supposed to be a two week trip.  When the deal was done, they had all six tickets in and out of hawaii on the same day.  Expedia WOULD NOT WORK WITH ME to fix the problem.  Long story short, IT ENDED UP COSTING ME AN ADDITIONAL $1800 to correct the problem.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-02 3
 ("Hotels and Flights" is only half right.) This app, despite its name, is only to hotels, not flights.

Version 3.0.2 2013-05-02 5
 (Good) Good

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-30 1
 (No flights; waste of time) This app came up for booking flights but appears to be for hotels only. Big waste of time. Grrrrr! Uninstall.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-30 1
 (Only for Hotels, not Flights) The iPad version only lets you search for hotels, not flights. I will update my rating once they add flights back.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-30 1
 (No Flights Booking) Only Hotels. No Flight Booking!

Version 3.0 2013-04-30 5
 (Excelente) Me encanto el app muy fácil de usar!

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-30 5
 (Excellent and efficient app) Easy to use and very fast booking! Set up an account online and book a flight!

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-30 5
 (Great App) 10/10

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-29 1
 (Useless without account) Useless without account and can't create an account in app.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-28 5
 (Pretty swagged out) Great app

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-28 1
 (Expedia) Will not install updates

Version 2.3.1 2013-04-28 5
 (Works really smooth) I was surprised at how quick and easy this app worked to book my Vegas hotel. Plus it had better prices than the Expedia website.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-27 5
 (Awesome!!) So simple, so fast!

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-27 5
 (Convenient App) Very easy to book rooms for my planned Utah trip. Used the hotel reviews, and then a few finger taps, and done.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-27 5
 (Why don't they make more travel apps like this one?) I had downloaded 15 travel apps before I tried this one and now I'm beating myself up for wasting so much time with the others?! Thanks for knowing exactly how I like it Expedia!!

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-26 5
 (Great App - Mobile Exclusive Pricing Saved Me $$$$) Well designed.  Intuitive interface stepped me through the best deals for each hotel near my destination.  30 fresh reviews available even for a hotel off the interstate in a small town.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-26 4
 (Great app) Proper functionality

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-25 1
 (Deception) I tried to book and date was well hidden, so booked hotel 11 hour drive away for same evening as booking and Expedia wouldn't help to change. Just charged card. Hotel was much more accommodating. 
Be careful they will try and deceive and just take money without offering service. 
App about to be deleted from iPad. Goodbye Expedia, hello others with good service reps.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-25 1
 (You cannot search for flights!!) Even when it says that the app is also for flights it doesnt let you search flights. It is only for hotels. Unlike the one for iPhone.

Version 2.3.1 2013-04-25 5
 (Aces) This app is awesome. That one touch add it to calendar button really sealed the deal, but everything else already seemed really well designed, both functionally and aesthetically. By far one of the more pleasant experiences on such a small screen. Great job.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-24 4
 (Good one) The is real good once you book your flight. Nice graphical view with every detail being user friendly.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-24 1
 (Spam) This is repeated daily spam on my FB newsfeed and I am so sick of seeing it as a suggested app.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-23 4
 (I can't book flights!) Looks like the iPad version is only for hotels. Good thing I'm not  the only one having this problem. I thought I was blind or going crazy.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-23 1
 (Can't book flights) You can't book flights with this app, even though you can on the iPhone.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-22 1
 (Mostly useless on the iPad) Why do I shop Expedia? For FLIGHTS! The App will let me shop for flights on the iPhone,  but not the iPad. Not much good it does to plan a trip on the iPad when you cannot shop for flights.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-22 5
 (Awesome app) You will need it for sure when you are on vecation

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-21 1
 (Not so hot.) And update was indicated. It's now been "installing" on my iPhone for the last 3-4 days & I can't stop it. Maybe someday. Annoying.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-21 5
 (Perfect for booking hotels) It is much faster to complete bookings with this app than the pc....

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-21 2
 (Need flights on iPad) Mostly useless without the ability to book flights

Version 1.5 2013-04-21 1
 (Possibly the worst app ever) Can't make flight reservations. What is possibly the point?

Version 1.6 2013-04-20 5
 (Simple, fast, easy) Thank you, this app rocks! Nothing easier!

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-20 1
 (Terrible...) Can't books flights on it. Worthless.

Version 2.1 2013-04-20 5
 (Very nice, slick redesign, perfect!) Very impressed with the redesign of their app, this is coming from a software engineer who knows a thing or two about GUIs.  Loved gyroscope
Door hanger thing used as a loading screen, very easy to input billing information and it works exactly as you would expect.  Only suggestion is add a filter by name field or at least a sort by name, had to search by city then find the specific hotel on map rather than by name but not a biggie.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-19 5
 (Perfect) Read super accurate reviews and selected two hotels and booked them both, all from my phone.  Awesome app!!!

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-19 5
 (Beautiful Redesign!!) Itinerary viewer is just so intuitive and (not to mention) beautiful!! 
I look forward to future updates and designs. 
Good job, Expedia

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-18 5
 (Love it) Beautiful app. It's so easy to use, flies seamlessly on my iPhone 5. I love it.

Version 3.0.2 2013-04-18 1
 (A bit pointless without flights, activities, etc.) Apparently some of this functionality is available via iPhone/iPod, but not iPad. Until I can book flights, hotels, car rentals, and activities from my iPad, this app isn't much use to me.

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-18 5
 (Mr. C) After trying several other apps, I settled on this one.
It has become my favorite. Great app!

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-17 1
 (Bad) This app always gives me issues the web site is a lot better

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-16 1
 (Not user friendly) Can't figure out how to search for flights. This app is not user friendly at all!!!

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-16 1
 (Location services off) I asked for a hotel based on current location and they gave me location 40 minutes away. Thinking it was close and then booked it. When I realized my error I asked for refund 10 minutes later and the nice folks at Extended Stay America would not refund even a cent.

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-16 3
 (Needs flight booking for iPad) Please add!! Great otherwise, but I want to use this on my iPad.

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-15 1
 (Terrible app!) Can't find airport based on city name. Stupidest search function ever!

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-14 5
 (Awesome App - Easy to use) Great app!!

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-14 1
 (No flight choices? Why?) Nice, I can look at Paris hotels. But, no flight info? What?

Version 3.0 2013-04-14 1
 (A disaster) Is it me or is this app incapable of booking a simple flight from a city you're not in to another city you're not in? No need to answer, I spent 5 minutes on it before I realized no app has that long a learning curve and will now delete it. 

Another triumph of Marketing people over common sense.

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
 (Great app) I have used this app several times and have never had a problem!!!!

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
 (Great Rate) Paid 87.00 per night at a Hampton Inn very nice place. Has pool and hot tub!

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 4
 (Great app !!!!!) BUT !!! 

The itinerary is the best feature but it list trips by locations so when we have 6 different ppl going to the same location it's hard to find your flight. 

Next. Could we please look at the return trip info and details. !! The app shows that u have a trip home but you can't  click to view the details have to log onto the website to see all that info.

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
 (Excellent app!) This app makes reservations as quick and easy as possible. Much more intuitive than Travelocity.

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 1
 (Worthless) Why launch an app for the iPad that doesn't search and book flights?  Unless you're looking for an app to book a hotel only...don't waste your time.  Stick to the website.

Version 3.0 2013-04-13 4
 (Great potential) I gotta say. I was very excited for the redesign of this app. And it was very well implemented. But a few details could make it an even better app. It has a lot of potential to become the 'must have' for any traveler. 

One feature that would be welcomed is Passbook support. Another would be to see the saved itineraries on your account. And also check points balance. 

Keep up the good work! I'm sure you'll make it even better. :)

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
 (Best travel app ever!!!) I book a lot of travel and this app is the best!  So user friendly with great details and pictures to help me make the right hotel choice!  I am super thrilled with this app!

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
 (Above and Beyond!) I've reviewed this app a few times but I want to note that this app is getting continuously better. Well made! I'd like to see an "add to maps" and "add to calendar" function one day.

Version 3.0.1 2013-04-12 1
 (No flight booking option for iPad) What kind of iPad travel app is incapable of letting you book transportation? Expedia's travel app! This app seems only good for booking hotel rooms. I guess you have to use a competitors app to book your flight. While there, you might as well bundle your hotel and car rental and just delete the Expedia app altogether.

Version 3.0 2013-04-12 1
 (No flights) Poorly organized as there is no option to explore flights. Once you open the app and enter your current location, it automatically takes you to hotels in your area with no (obvious) way of searching for flights. Needs to be fixed. Orbitz, Travelocity and other travel apps have a much easier user face.

Version 3.0 2013-04-12 1
 (New is not better) Your new site is very inadequate and lacks old sort capabilities. Very frustrating!

Version 3.0 2013-04-11 5
 (Best travel app EVER for iPhone5!) Great hotel info and lightning hotel and air travel booking!

Version 3.0 2013-04-11 5
 (Emergency Stay) This app is flippin FANTASTIC! It's easier to use than the website! LOL!

Version 3.0 2013-04-11 1
 (Can't book flights) You can't look at flights on an iPad which makes this app worthless.

Version 3.0 2013-04-11 5
 (Facil, oportuno y simple) Lo mejor para planificar un viaje. Mo te complica en nada y es muy intuitivo.

Version 3.0 2013-04-11 4
 (Expedia) Pretty good

Version 3.0 2013-04-10 1
 (Loser app) Won't support flight search on iPad?  DELETE. Back to Travelocity.

Version 3.0 2013-04-10 1
 (Not close to Expedia's standard, fix it!) Like another reviewer...no flights...half an app or an use interface so poor we can't find one of two major buttons.  And the annoying swinging door sign...work on functionality, clean and effective not gimmicks!  I am an Expedia VIP ( ie use it a lot) and might use it even more if the App worked.

Version 3.0 2013-04-10 3
 (Flight info not there) I cannot figure out how to access the flight portion. I click on trips and shop but it defaults back to hotels. Please update to fix bug. Thank you

Version 3.0 2013-04-09 4
 (Very user friendly) Love the app, I would like to have a few more options beyond flight and hotel.

Version 3.0 2013-04-09 1
 (Journey) I put my itinerary # in and it keeps saying they can't find anything.. What's up with that? I wanted to look it up just out of curiosity. I'm not to sure about this app.

Version 3.0 2013-04-09 3
 (Ok) Does not allow for multiple destinations on the same trip or arriving and departing from different airports. The controls are not intuitive.

Version 3.0 2013-04-08 5
 (Excelente App) Excellent app super fast

Version 3.0 2013-04-07 4
 (Expedia) Would like to be able to buy multiple rooms in one session

Version 3.0 2013-04-07 1
 (No flights) No flights? I am disappointed...

Version 3.0 2013-04-07 5
 (Review of Expedia app) I am miffed by the large number of 1 star reviews. Though I do understand the need of 1 stop shop, there is not 1 single hospitality service provider on this planet that knows my preferences and budget. Therefore, transit and stay are 2 components of the travel booking experience that cause friction when joined in one checkout pipeline.

This app, hotel only, should be reviewed as such and and not against a standard that isn't met by anyone on this planet.

For ease of use, visual appeal, fluency and price point I am giving this app 5 stars. Never ever did I experience such a frictionless hotel booking experience. So critical booking elements such as price, selection and ease of use were all met.

Version 3.0 2013-04-07 5
 (Best travel app!!!) This has made my life soo much easier. Booking travel while running in a treadmill or going through security.... So much nicer than any other travel app! Well done guys! Keep pushing the pretty pixels!

Version 3.0 2013-04-07 1
 (Seriously!) How can you call this app hotels and flights when a user cannot book a flight.  Worthless app! Uninstalled

Version 3.0 2013-04-07 2
 (Where is the flight booking?!) I don't get it. Isn't flight booking is a big part of your business? This app is pretty useless without it. The mobile division of Expedia should have thought about that before releasing the app

Version 3.0 2013-04-06 3
 (Nice but missing the car rental option) Nice but missing the car rental option

Version 3.0 2013-04-06 3
 (Needs FLIGHTS!) Missing flight booking. Aside from that it works well and I enjoy the look of my itinerary.

Version 3.0 2013-04-06 1
 (Awful) Where is the flight search option. Stupid app ever.

Version 3.0 2013-04-06 1
 (Hotel only?) What is the point of an Expedia hotel only app? I want flight info!! No thank you for this app.

Version 3.0 2013-04-05 1
 (Dissapointed.) Installed this app to save my itinerary in the "trips list." It wasn't able to find my itinerary while I was able to access it on the website. Tried multiple times, still no good outcome. Useless.

Version 3.0 2013-04-05 1
 (Slow server) Haven't been able to load one search. Always times out. If I new wireless Internet ill be at my comp...

Version 3.0 2013-04-05 5
 (Great) Easy and great to use

Version 2.2 2013-04-04 2
 (No package!) Doesn't offer both the hotel & flight unless you go to their website, which I have to do. However it's an okay app for just browsing places.

Version 3.0 2013-04-02 1
 (Updating chaos) Every day (and multiple times daily) i get a notice for updating the app. Each time i hit update, it doesnt work. I've never had an app act so strange

Version 3.0 2013-04-02 1
 (Won't let u bundle flight and hotel) Just skip and go directly to main website if your looking to bundle your flight and hotel. I can't believe this app doesn't offer that option.

Version 3.0 2013-04-01 1
 (Worthless) The whole point of Expedia is to have a one stop shop for flights, hotels, and activities.  I don't just want to see rooms.  Don't bother with this app-just go to their website.

Version 3.0 2013-04-01 1
 (User interface pretty, app interface blows) I have selected a flight, made a wrong choice and can only proceed to checkout?  I can never pick another flight, back to the website.

Version 3.0 2013-03-31 5
 (Awesome App) Thanks for such wonderful app!!!

Version 3.0 2013-03-31 5
 (Great for booking hotels!) Found a mobile only rate that was cheaper than online and booking over the phone.

Version 3.0 2013-03-31 1
 (Flight and hotel???) Seriously u can't do both like the regular site. Ill never use this till its fixed.

Version 3.0 2013-03-31 1
 (Flights?) On my iPad and can't find flights or packages, only finding hotels.

Version 3.0 2013-03-31 1
 (one way only?) crap app what is this junk who the Fu put 4 star? for what?
so ffff app

Version 3.0 2013-03-30 1
 (App fail) I am in Brazil and the app doesn't allow me to login into my US account. #fail

Also when I tried to access the app page on App Store they redirected me to iTunes. #fail

Version 3.0 2013-03-30 5
 (FUN TO USE) I almost want to book hotels by just using this app. Amazing and smart user interface, very Applelesk, very clean and to the point. Great job guys!

Version 3.0 2013-03-30 1
 (Flights?) Like other reviewers, I can't see how to search for flights.

Version 3.0 2013-03-30 5
 (Better and better) This is now the best travel related app. Each update has improved its usefulness, and it is beautifully designed. Keep it up!

Version 3.0 2013-03-30 1
 (Are you kidding me?) Is it just me who can't seem to locate the flight search within this app? I'm on iPad, and that flight search is supposed to work as advertised. Leaving out that essential feature while avertising it as a flight search app is unacceptable!

Version 3.0 2013-03-30 1
 (It doesn't open anymore) I updated the app and it does not work anymore

Version 3.0 2013-03-29 1
 (Flight search does NOT work) One star for not able to search for flight even after updates!  This app should not feature flight search if Expedia is not ready to offer it on iPhone.  Considering its rivals all have apps supporting flight, hotel and rental car searches, there is no excuse for the mishap!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 5
 (Great stay) Needed a place to stay the night before we go back home and was close to the airport. 5 minutes! This place was clean and comfortable.  Friendly staff as well.  I would recommend and would come back again :)

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 2
 (Bad deals) You'll fine better deals at other websites.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 1
 (No flights!) Why call it Hotels and Flights if it doesn't do flights?  Wasted my time.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 5
 (Nadine) Great for hotel searches! Very user friendly.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 1
 (Useless for anything but hotels) I wanted to check on flights, rental cars, etc.  All it would do was hotels.  Meh, not what I wanted.  There was a SEPARATE app to look at flight arrivals and departures, sized for iPhone not iPad, but it also wouldn't price or book anything.  Overall pretty useless...

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 4
 (Great for hotels!) Wonderful app for booking hotels. Love the pictures you can view and the map showing where the hotel is located in relation to others. May sort them by rating, popularity, pricing, etc.  
Reviews from patrons may be sorted as well. Wonderful app for hotels only, doesn't really work for flights.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 1
 (Terrible - Bait and Switch) I was looking for a flight and saw one on the app for $95.00. It was the lowest price by far. When I went to buy it, the price jumped to $235.00. I can do better with a browser.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 4
 (It works!) What more can you ask for? A lot!  but I love this app nonetheless!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 1
 (Buuuugs) Cant search and book any flight!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 5
 (Easy to use.) Booking hotels was easy for experienced Expedia traveler.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 1
 (Useless) All it would do is hotels and nothing else. Unless you are looking for hotel.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 1
 (Not as intuitive as the website) Couldn't seem to get out of search for hotels in my backyard. Most useful thing was the link to the website.  
Deleted within a couple of hours, too frustrating.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 1
 (No Flights!!) Despite its name, there's no ability to do a flight search (US)!!
Don't waste your time with this app.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 5
 (Easier to use than I ever would have imagined.) Very well designed.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 5
 (Expedia Ap) Fast & Easy. Loved it!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 2
 (Major flaw for families) When looking for flights you can select number of adults, but not children. This is a major over site. This ap is therefore useless and will be deleted

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 1
 (No flights?) Would give it no stars if that was an option. come on.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-25 5
 (Great App!) It took me less than a minute to make a reservation. Thank u!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-25 1
 (🌟) Flights?!?!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-24 1
 (Since last update it's unusable) Crashes upon search, waist of time nd memory. Such a petty, I like Expedia... Used to be *****

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-24 5
 (Easy & integrated) Simple

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-24 2
 (Poor interface) Very poor interface, not much options to search flights.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-23 3
 (Reward points not available) Everything was perfect, so easy, you can book your planes, hotels, on the go!! But I couldn't use my Expedia points!!!!! Neither did I receive any!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-23 4
 (Easy and quick!) This app made planning a two day trip quick and easy. Thanks!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-22 1
 (Vuelo) Quiero ir a Orlando y en el vuelo no te da la fecha de regreso y otras cosa. Esta aplicación no es buena

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-22 3
 (Best interface ever) CRASHES ALL THE TIME. Download in a year when they finally figure it out.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-21 1
 (Disappointing) Returns only economy with restrictions, no other class of seating/price. Not worth the time to download.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-20 1
 (What flights?) There's no flights...only hotels. Ummm, I wasn't planning on swimming across an ocean, so hotel is useless without the transportation.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-20 4
 (Like the app....) Good, but is there a way to book more than 1 room I didn't see...?

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-20 5
 (Life just got easier!!!) I just booked a hotel in 3 minutes... From start to finish!!!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-20 1
 (No flight booking) Despite the name, there is no flight booking - useless for me

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-20 5
 (Best app) This is the best travel app out there.. So easy to use.. I'm super impressed!!! Booked a trip in 5 minutes!! So easy and convenient

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-19 5
 (Expedia online booking) I live Expedia app so easy to use has my profile on file and I can book using mg smart phone and Expedia app anywhere in the world. App even recognizes my current location and suggestion for near location hotels. After review of the hotel I am able to simply accept and book and all info auto transmitted from my profile. It also saves my reservation data in passbook so I do not need to print a hard copy to present it to the hotel.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-18 5
 (Great Travel Agent) A best fried for someone who needs a deal buddy.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-18 5
 (Fantastic App) Super quick and easy hotel booking.  The deals look to be the best I've found.
Love the addition of flights.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-18 4
 (Good thus far) I think this app should mimic the revised web site a bit more. I enjoy the layout of the app but I can't select child passengers nor flight times. Seeing this in the update would be worth 5 stars!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-17 5
 (Great for finding hotels!) This is a very user friendly App when it comes to finding a hotel. I like how all of the information is divided up, but you don't have to lose your search.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-16 1
 (Junk) To difficult   To much information on a page

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-16 5
 (great and easy !) love this app , makes it so easy to book

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-16 1
 (No flight search) Poor app there is no where to search for flights

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-16 2
 (Cant book flights on iPad version) Nice app but cant book flights on the iPad version only on the iPhone.  Please fix....

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-16 5
 (Great App!) I love this app and will definitely be using it again!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-16 5
 (Great app) Easy to use, looks good, too.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-14 5
 (Last minute success!!) Thank you so much for a painless way to save money in a last minute night. We were switching hotels after an unpleasant first night and Expedia came through with a high end Vegas hotel. A seemless check in too. 
Great flexible cancellation policy too.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-14 2
 (Misleading name) The app does not allow to book flights. Why is the word "flights" in the name????

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-13 5
 (Great travel app) Fast and easy to use. Just used it to book an AC trip. Fast updates and great competitive prices!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-13 4
 (Does the job quickly) Once you figure out the non-intuitive interface.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-13 5
 (Very nice) Very clean UI. Pleasant to use.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-13 5
 (Awesome App!) Just booked my hotel with it for our Hawaii trip!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-12 5
 (Very well designed, useful app) Completely saved me from disaster at SXSW.  Thanks Expedia!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-12 5
 (Finally an Expedia app for flights!) This app works great! It's fast and visually slick. Thanks for a great experience.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 2
 (Can't book a flight with ipad app) When this option will be available, ill review it again

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 5
 (Always the best.) It's nice application easy to use. Thank you Expedia team for your  support and help to make my vacations true all the time and each time is much better than last one.

Only one suggestion please ask the hotel to take full pictures from all angles or using panorama style.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 2
 (Loading time) The loading time on the flight search is much too long! I enjoy the interactive download screen with the passenger window, but it does not make up for the amount of time spent just trying to search for flights.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 2
 (Ehhh) It doesn't let you choose round trip. :/ fix it please

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 4
 (Years of lowest price success) I've compared with other companies, simultaneously searching for best price and found equal or better deals with Expedia even when looking for last minute flights.  Had difficulty years ago, yet it keeps getting easier.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-10 5
 (Convient) It is fast and easy... Always use thi app and find the best prices

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-09 5
 (Hilton Waikoloa Village) We read all of the reviews prior to booking out trip to Kona
Let me be honest....you should take reviews as nothing but gossip
The Hilton Waikoloa Resort is beautiful!
Some reviews tell of the annoying birds...REALLY?  They have 40 varieties of birds and animals on a 35 acre resort
The Minah birds announce sunrise & sunset enthusiastically everyday
It is part of the wonderful nature in Hawaii   If you didn't like them then stay home and listen to the sounds of your neighborhood!?# whats more annoying are the rude people and loud and unruly kids!
The resort has something for everyone a magnificent lagoon with beautiful fish and turtles to snorkle within a safe environment!
And the person who complained that none of the rooms could see the ocean!  They could not have been more wrong!
If you want oceanFRONT then pay for it! It is a open beautiful view of the ocean and many whales with nothing between you but a little grass and a few palms!   There are also partial ocean, lagoon, and garden views available 
Don't believe everything you read on the internet! It is a gorgeous resort with wonderful amenities and employees!
It is a Hilton    It is Hawaii   How can you go wrong?

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-09 4
 (Bonus!!) Saved an extra 30% on hotel using mobile app

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-08 5
 (Fantastic) An awesome app. Its so useful and so easy to use. really a good job!!!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-07 4
 (Easy to use) All aspects are easy to use, the final checkout is a bit confusing, you have to have every single field filled out to finish and pay, but it does not tell you where the errors are. You'll figure it out pretty quick though. Great deals and selection...integrates with their website and your online profile.

Version 2.3 2013-03-06 5
 (Great app!) Only used it once to actually book a hotel, but have researched various hotels, flights, and locations using this app. So far, I love it. Very easy to use. Lets you put in the exact location. Of where you're going to be and let's you find hotels nearby. Have compared the prices here to other apps and they truly are one of the lowest. Would def recommend!

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-05 1
 (Fault app) Put my dates of travel in, picked my room, confirmed purchase and it switched my dates of travel to that day.....had to spend over a hour with Expedia trying to get my money back

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-04 2
 (Can't review hotels) It doesn't let you review hotels, only allows reading of other reviews. Why is this most basic functionality not present? Because they rushed it onto the App Store without usability testing.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-04 1
 (Crap.) This is not an app; it's a crapp (clever, eh?). Does not let you book flights. Good thing I only downloaded this to get nano pods on Battle Nations.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-03 5
 (Amazingly well-developed app) Does everything it's supposed to do, in style. Fantastic. 

Of course, Expedia deals are really nice too. :)

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-02 1
 (Why bother) No flight search capability

Version 2.3 2013-03-01 3
 (Easy to use) It's easy to use. App design looks nice and pretty. Should automatic update itinerary to TripaAssist.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-01 1
 (This is ridiculous) How can you guys not have flight and hotel packages? This is a huge disappointment. I almost booked a hotel with no flight. They should be more clear with this.

Version 2.3.1 2013-03-01 1
 (Does not work!) Flight search does not work! The "Search Error" appears with the message "The operation couldn`t be completed. (MOErrorDomain Error 5.)".
The app is now completely useless!

Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 1
 (No flights?) There's not a way to check flight prices? Useless.

Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 1
 (No Flights) You would expect that an app that says hotels and FLIGHTS would be able to supply both. I downloaded the app thinking I'd be able to find something. After painfully trying to figure it out, I went on a google search only to find out that it's something they don't have now but hope to have in the future. Despite the fact that in their update they stated you can "book a flight to anywhere in the world." Either fix they need to fix this soon or they should in the least stop misleading people and just say this a way to search for Hotels only by changing the name. As far as I'm concerned, this app is worthless!

Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 3
 (Keeps freezing) Great app except for it keeps freezing.

Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 1
 (Can't book from Tokyo) I'm living in Tokyo and I can't even search flights via the app because its not available in my location -_- I can with Travelocity...

Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 2
 (Pretty Bad) It would be nice to be able to change search locations from the map.  Alternately or in addition- it would be nice to be able set the search radius. 

Also does not show very many search results.

Version 2.3 2013-02-27 2
 (Why is the last update stuck on installing) ....

Version 2.3 2013-02-26 5
 (Very easy to use) App is very easy to use.  Wish I could book multiple rooms at the same property at the same time.

Version 2.3 2013-02-26 5
 (Easy to use!) Just used the app to book a spring break hotel in Miami. Super easy to use, a monkey could do it.

Version 2.3 2013-02-26 1
 (Rubbish) Book a flight? But not on the ipad... Useless

Version 2.3 2013-02-25 1
 (BEWARE!) Expedia sent me to a hotel with a bad reservation. I wasn't able to stay at the hotel and Expedia still is trying to charge my account. The prices shown in the app aren't true to the real price and change after the reservation. Expedia is a scam!

Version 2.3 2013-02-25 2
 (need to add car rental) what's missing from this app is a car rental icon so we can book a car rental.

Version 2.3 2013-02-25 1
 (Expedia navigation horrible) Cannot find flight search. Really poor app.

Version 2.3 2013-02-24 5
 (Useful) Very easy and helpful to find hotels in small towns.

Version 2.2 2013-02-23 1
 (Bad) I only fly first and business, this app is unusable for me...

Version 2.3 2013-02-23 5
 ("Go to" site) Live in Maine, travel south often.  This is the go-to site when looking for reservations!

Version 2.3 2013-02-22 1
 (Garbage.) What's the point of the aircraft logo AND the name without being able to search flights??? Idiotic app!

Version 2.3 2013-02-22 1
 (No good) Where are the flights?!!

Version 2.3 2013-02-21 3
 (Hotels, but no Flights) Why would you call an app Expedia Hotels and Flights if you cannot book flights.  It did a good job for a mobile app to help me find, choose and book a hotel, even let me log in with my Expedia credentials.  But there is no way to find or book a flight.  Either fix it or rename the app.  Rookie move.

Version 2.3 2013-02-21 1
 (What happened?) Someone goofed big! Can't get flights! Unusable!

Version 2.3 2013-02-21 1
 (Ridiculous) None of the functionality of the website. You can't even log into your Expedia account. You can't book flights. A laughable app in this day and age.

Version 2.2 2013-02-21 2
 (Little functionality) This app provides little functionality compared to their website. You can do simple searches but not robust or detailed ones. And there is no place to put your account info to save your information, trips, etc. If you book on their website, you won't be able to pull the trip up in this app. Needs work.

Version 2.2 2013-02-20 1
 (Why is "flights and hotels" in the title when you can't book flights) Can only book hotels.  Lame!

Version 2.2 2013-02-20 5
 (Expedia) Great app

Version 2.2 2013-02-20 1
 (Shameful) Have been using Expedia for over a decade and was a great fan. Recently booked a room in Naples for $90 or so with it and was very happy.
Downloaded the app, and was quoted the same on Expedia web today, yet $180 on the app for same room!
Hasta la Vista...
Downloading Yayak now

Version 2.2 2013-02-20 5
 (Great) Awesome app!!!

Version 2.2 2013-02-20 1
 (Horrible) This app is terrible. You can only book trips for a single person... who goes on vacation alone?

Version 2.2 2013-02-19 3
 (It is OK) Worth looking at to get an idea of what hotels are around, wished they et al. would have a pet friendly search option, as is, can not use since we travel with 2 dogs.

Version 2.2 2013-02-19 1
 (Worst app ever) I never leave a review and this app is so bad I must.  Nothing more than one log advertisement.  Not usable.  No access to my itineraries.   Just plain bad.

Version 2.2 2013-02-18 1
 (Prices) I love Expedia and have used them for YEARS.  I was excited to get the app since i use the site so much but found prices on the app and the prices on the website were so different. The app quoted almost $100 more than the website!  Old school shopping for me.

Version 2.0 2013-02-18 5
 (Convenient, fast, quick and easy to read reviews and access location) Very easy to use - all the important stuff: location, reviews, price

Version 2.2 2013-02-17 5
 (This app is amazing!) It looks great and works really well.

Version 2.2 2013-02-17 4
 (Good App, not suitable for slow people) Not sure why so many people gave this such bad reviews, saying they couldn't book flights/round trips. Perhaps there's been an update in the past coupe of days since they wrote those reviews (or perhaps those people are a bit slow....in which case I guess the app needs some improvements to make it easier for *everyone* to use).
Personally I found it very easy to use, the interface was great, especially compared to using the website on my phone. I'd give it 5 stars, except there doesn't seem to be a way to book a flight for more than one person at a time - I looked everywhere. Perhaps I'm slow too?

Version 2.2 2013-02-17 1
 (Awful) Just awful.  You can't even book flights or more than one night in a hotel.

Version 2.1 2013-02-16 1
 (Scam) Why no flights? There are only hotels...

Version 2.2 2013-02-16 1
 (Traveling Man) Am I the only one who couldn't get a price on round trip just 1 way? Also could not find choices to pick first class, direct flights or time of day preferred to fly.

Version 2.2 2013-02-16 5
 (Expedia) Great app!!!

Version 2.2 2013-02-15 1
 (Fake advertising) Offered 10% discount for hotels if I use mobile app. The coupon didn't work. Deleted the app, will never use Expedia, booked through kayak

Version 2.2 2013-02-15 5
 (Excellent) Easy to use. Comprehensive. Best price guarantee! What else do you need?

Version 2.2 2013-02-15 5
 (Fun to use!) So quick and easy to use!  Saved us 40% on our first stay!  Thanks

Version 2.2 2013-02-14 4
 (Tman) Great app

Version 2.2 2013-02-14 3
 (Not bad) Doso

Version 2.2 2013-02-14 2
 (no flights? no account info) There's basically nothing here.  Kayak for now!

Version 2.2 2013-02-14 2
 (Terrible) Awful interface.

Version 2.2 2013-02-14 5
 (LOVE N AMAZING!!!) This app was easy!! It saved me $20 on one night stay. That wasn't including my work discount either. I love how the resorts had all my information n room ready n set for me when I came. I also loved this app because it allowed me to c when I checked in n out. It also showed me discounts around the resort.  U MUST USE THIS APP!!!!! I referred this app to all my family n friends!! :) beat my expectations for sure!! :)

Version 2.2 2013-02-13 4
 (Great ads. Good but limited app) I downloaded this app, believe or not, from an ad I saw in the accuweather
app. Although this is not a review of the ads, I feel I need to give the Expedia team thumbs up on creativity. The rotating Las Vegas images are awesome!!

Now back to the app itself. The good news: The app is really beautifully assembled and it is very user friendly. The bad news: needs more work for booking flights and general integration with other Expedia properties.

I think there's lots of potential here, though. Good job.

Version 2.2 2013-02-13 1
 (No Flight Search?!) How can a hotel&flight app without flight searching faction?!

Version 2.2 2013-02-13 2
 (FAIL!!!) One star because it is the minimum and one because it is free so I don't feel cheated by deleting it.

Version 2.2 2013-02-13 1
 (Horrible) Very surprised an app is released that is this poor. Please read the reviews... This is not worth downloading!

Version 2.2 2013-02-13 1
 (No flight search on iPad. You call this Expedia???) How can Expedia put out an iPad app that doesn't search flights? Are you kidding?  This is awful. Quick delete and back to kayak.

Version 2.1 2013-02-13 3
 (Incomplete) Can't see my Itineraries after I book. 
Wish it could save it for offline use also when I am out if country.

Version 2.2 2013-02-12 1
 (Mixed up) Tried to look up rates for a time other than Tonite.  Ap did not allow mr to enter dates when I would be traveling.

Version 2.0 2013-02-12 4
 (Fast and Easy) Very convenient and easy to use. Reliable ratings and Hotel reviews. 
Easy breezy

Version 2.2 2013-02-12 1
 (Worst travel app I've used) This is the only travel app I have ever disliked. There is no access to account info, itineraries, etc. For use as a poor sales tool. As a traveling IT Manager for 14 years it seems some college kids were in charge of this project, not actual users and travelers.

Version 2.2 2013-02-12 1
 (This app could not be more useless) Why would I want to search only one way flights? With no ability to select which class I want?

Version 2.2 2013-02-11 1
 (Really bad) So limited and basic

Version 2.2 2013-02-11 5
 (good) so good sistem.

Version 2.2 2013-02-10 5
 (Well made app) I dont know why other users giving this app bad reviews cause i find it almost perfect in every sense for booking hotels, I guess more work needs to be done for flight bookings.
It needs juat a little more development to be superb. It gives you this map search by visible area which is outstanding. I would use the mobile version just to gather rate information then book on the pc. It would be grear if developers add a feature in which you can check distance between a hotel and a certain address or attraction.

Version 2.2 2013-02-10 2
 (Opening) Will not load flights. Coca error.

Version 2.2 2013-02-10 5
 (Easy to Use!) Simplistic app that allows easy booking of flights or hotels. After I booked my hotel it allowed me to add my booking to the passbook. You can log in to Expedia or book without an account. Fantastic!

Version 2.2 2013-02-09 5
 (EXCELENTE APLICACIÓN PARA CUPO INTERNET CADIVI) Para los venezolanos es una buena alternativa para viajar de forma placentera y económica con el cupo asignado de dólares.

Version 2.2 2013-02-09 1
 (Not good) Deleted after 10 mins. It's useless.

Version 2.2 2013-02-08 1
 (Negative 1) This App is hillarious.  I was attempting to find a flight. I select the originating flight.  Price shows as $178. I select the flight back. Price still shows $178. On the final screen price is recalculated  now it shows $298.  What a waste of time.

Version 2.2 2013-02-08 1
 (This is Not Expedia) The most valuable feature is the ability to launch the Expedia web site

Version 2.2 2013-02-08 5
 (First booking, so far so good) Was able to find and book hotel using my Expedia account. Pics, reviews, maps, pretty much everything you find on Expedia site is there. So far 5 stars.

Version 2.2 2013-02-08 1
 (Only one way?) I tried a few times to book a round trip ticket, but it only gave me the option of booking a one-way flight. I even tried deleting the app and reloading it to see if it would change anything. I tried navigating through the app to see if I was missing something, but I still can't understand how to do it. I guess I'll stick to the website.

Version 2.2 2013-02-07 5
 (Easy and fast) In a matter of min I can search, review, and purchase a room.

Version 2.2 2013-02-07 1
 (Pointless) I would give this app zero stars if I could. There is no flight search and you cannot log in to your Expedia account. Serves no purpose don't waste your energy downloading it. 

Terrible.

Version 2.2 2013-02-06 4
 (Best booking app) I love this app.  I can book hotels based on location and filters.  One thing need to improve is the hotels I booked show mobile booking in my itineraries and I can't tell which one is which.

Version 2.2 2013-02-06 2
 (Hotels only??) I thought that I would be able to check and book flights and access my Expedia account but this app seems only to let me look at hotels.  It is therefore not helpful- I'll go back to web access.....

Version 2.2 2013-02-06 5
 (So easy to book) This app is the easiest way to book a flight or hotel. I travel a lot and It literally took me a minute to book a flight and hotel. Thank you Expedia!

Version 2.2 2013-02-06 5
 (Awesome app) Awesome app

Version 2.2 2013-02-06 1
 (Garbage app) I just deleted this app after several attempts to make sense of it. Despite its name, you can't book flights. And you can't access your expedia account. What's the point of the app then?

Version 2.2 2013-02-05 1
 (Can't view my stuff!!!) What's the point of an Expedia app that doesn't let you see your Expedia account?  I'm deleting.

Version 2.2 2013-02-04 1
 (Wow, Another worthless app) I am really getting concerned about the terrible apps that make it though the review process in Apple's App Store. This should have been rejected simply because it does nothing but show you where you are. Totally worthless and false advertising at that. Good thing I didn't have to pay because its going right to the trash.
I would much rather write a very positive review but my last two reviews have been negative because of crap like this. How is Apple approving these apps that don't work?

Version 2.2 2013-02-04 1
 (Worthless) As an Elite member of Expedia I have no idea why Expedia would release such a useless app.

Version 2.2 2013-02-03 1
 (Scam) No flights

Version 2.2 2013-02-03 1
 (Booking gone wrong) The app and Expedia will spoil your dream vacation. Stay away from Expedia. Just booked a hotel at Key largo and called the hotel a day after. It was not booked! It's been two days now and they always say wait for another day to fix it! Save your sanity and stay away!!!

Version 2.2 2013-02-02 1
 (No flights) Deleting, no flights just hotels

Version 2.2 2013-02-02 1
 (No airlines) The app only lets me see hotels no Airlines.

Version 2.2 2013-02-01 2
 (Deleting. Want to do multiple travelers and flight and hotel together.) Not very useful

Version 2.2 2013-02-01 1
 (Useless) Why I can't book flights for 3 people together.

Version 2.2 2013-02-01 1
 (No flights? DELETED) I guess it is hotels only. False advertising. DELETED!

Version 2.2 2013-02-01 4
 (Very easy to use app!) Really easy to use and very helpful while travelling

Version 2.2 2013-01-31 4
 (Got a hotel fast) Started to do comparison between computer rates and this ap on the phone.  Never got to compare, this ap found a room in the right spot for a good price , so I took it.

Version 2.2 2013-01-31 3
 (Expedia app) Still waiting for the flight app.
Hotel only is not useful to me because I book flight, hotel and car all in one.
Please offer it soon.

Version 2.2 2013-01-31 1
 (Where are the flights?) I can't find the flights in the "Expedia Hotels & Flights" app.

Version 2.2 2013-01-31 5
 (Great App) Easy to use

Version 2.2 2013-01-31 2
 (Not updated or consistent with website) The prices do not match the websites prices for flights , not accurate, needs to be updated some more to reflect expedias website , it doesn't show the lowest price flights that are offered on the website and it also does not show all available flight options. I would rather browse on the website from my phone then use this app

Version 2.2 2013-01-30 1
 (Useless) Cant add a second traveler!!!!! WASTE OF TIME

Version 2.2 2013-01-30 1
 (Only 1 traveler - would have been nice to know...) I wasted an hour on the Expedia app trying to increase travelers from 1 to 2 yesterday after finding the deal I liked. I am a dad of 4 with already thin time margins, so it really tapped me. Then I finally googled an admittance by Mobiata, the Expedia app creator, that increasing travelers was a "feature" not yet included in this version of the app. Expedia has lost my trust.

Version 2.2 2013-01-30 1
 (Usefulness is very limited) The app is named hotels and flights, but currently offers only hotel booking for the iPad version. Why use this app when I can just go to the website and book flights, hotels and cars??? What's the point? Come on Expedia, really? Is this your best?
App deleted.

Version 2.2 2013-01-30 2
 (Not helpful for me) Can't look for deals or flight and hotel packages so not useful for me. Also difficult to navigate unless just looking for hotel or a flight.

Version 2.2 2013-01-30 1
 (No good for Flights) If you want to search hotels, then get it. 
FLIGHTS, totally useless

Version 2.2 2013-01-30 5
 (Great App!!) While PCSing (doing a military move) from VA to TX we needed hotels to stay at and not knowing some of the areas that we were traveling in, this App is awesome! Really easy to use and I love the checkout process! So easy and thought out. I can have my Expedia Rewards added as well to gain points as I book. I also needed a flight back from TX to VA and could do that all on the same App! 

Only negative is that Expedia needs to find a way to do flights on the App on the iPad. At this time you can only do flights and hotel on the App on the iPhone! Other than that I like it! :)

Version 2.1 2013-01-28 1
 (Horrible company) If I could rate them negative stars, I would. I Booked a trip back in May of 2012 through Expedia. It was a hotel plus car package. Turns out Expedia never paid for the car rental even though I paid Expedia. I started to receive letters and collection calls from the car rental place wanting me to pay them. When I asked why this wasn't being handled through Expedia, they told me Expedia was refusing to pay. I honestly cannot believe a big corporation would do something like this and I cannot believe that it's almost a year later and I'm still trying to resolve the issue. Thanks a lot Expedia. Bookers BEWARE!

Version 2.2 2013-01-28 5
 (Fun) It's one of the most funnest app to use. It's simple, interactive and creative. Will continue to use for my travel bookings.

Version 2.2 2013-01-28 1
 (Impossible to use.) I've been screwing around with this for ten minutes, and I still can't figure out how to search flights instead of hotels.  Ridiculous.  Don't waste your time.  Would give it zero stars if that was possible.

Version 2.2 2013-01-27 3
 (Some easy some hard) The search for a hotel was super easy and very thorough. However, figuring up how to set up an account was not easy at all! I had to go to the website to figure it out. Then go back to the app to book the hotel.

Version 2.2 2013-01-26 5
 (Great app!!!!) I love this app!!!

Version 2.2 2013-01-26 2
 (What the hell?) I can only book one ticket at a time? This is next to worthless. Only good for answering the question of what the price range I could expect is. Would never use this to actually book a flight.

Version 2.2 2013-01-26 1
 (Deleted) Downloaded and deleted within 5 min. Can't search flights it gives error.

Version 2.2 2013-01-26 1
 (Trouble downloading app???) I have an iPhone and have never had a problem downloading an app before. This app installs 1/2 way but then gets locked up (installation never completes).

Version 2.2 2013-01-26 1
 (Why no flight info?) Ridiculous that we can't see or book flights on this app.

Version 2.2 2013-01-25 1
 (NO FLIGHTS?!) What's the point of calling it "Fights & Hotels" if you can't book a flight on the iPad version?!

Version 2.1 2013-01-25 5
 (Great tool!) Great app to use for traveling. Although I don't travel very often I still find it very helpful when I need it.

Version 2.2 2013-01-25 1
 (Mostly Ads) I always check my own city to see how a travel app works. This app produced dismal results for an area with at least three excellent hotels. It was all hotels that had obviously paid to be recommended. Not at all useful. And I am a rewards member!  Deleted it

Version 2.2 2013-01-25 5
 (Perfect service) I messed up on my reservation, I called them and they had the change reservation fees waived.  Saved me money and they were extremely helpful.  Great app.

Version 2.1 2013-01-25 1
 (No flight info) Deceiving... Only hotel info no flights. :(

Version 2.1 2013-01-25 1
 (Pathetic company) Seems the company only cares about the bottom line. After booking into a hotel that only had two rooms left and both of them set to 52 degrees F. I could not remain there. Outside temp was 32 degrees F and falling. 

Expedia refuse to refund me. Use Travelocity or any other company instead.

Version 2.1 2013-01-25 2
 (Can't find where to book flight on iPad) I get info to book hotel, but can't find how to look at flights.  Frustrating!!!!

Version 2.1 2013-01-25 1
 (Dr.) Seriously. The flight options only include one way, not round-trip.

Version 2.1 2013-01-24 5
 (Really helpful app!) I don't travel much anymore compared to what I used to.  However, using this app on are cent trip to Montana and back to Birmingham has been a treat. As it is able to help me find hotels in the area and price range I wanted and then book it online so I know that I have room confirmed for the evening and the address I can input into my GPS and go straight there makes me wish that it had been available when I travelled more.  BTW, each time I arrived my information was already there and my room keys waiting for me making checking in very easy.

Version 2.1 2013-01-23 5
 (Absolutely Awesome App) Worked flawlessly and gave great info. Whoever developed this should be given a big raise.

Version 2.1 2013-01-22 1
 (Hotels only?) For some reason, this app claims to have the ability to lookup flights but the developers forgot to include that functionality.  

Running on an iPad and I can't find anything like a 'main screen' where I can search for a flight.  Seems to be stuck in hotel mode.

Version 2.1 2013-01-21 1
 (Only for novices) If you want irrelevant notices pinned to you smartphone screen, with no way to delete them, this is the app for you!

Version 2.1 2013-01-20 4
 (Great app! I have some suggestions!!) The app is awesome! It should have a way to save the hotels you like for future searches...

Version 2.1 2013-01-20 4
 (Good App) Clean, easy to use

Version 2.1 2013-01-20 3
 (No flights) When will we be able to book flights?  Nice app, but why leave the main part out...doesn't make sense.

Version 2.1 2013-01-20 5
 (great) worked great. found cheaper hotel price than any other sight and I looked at a lot of sights. forget kayak.

Version 2.1 2013-01-20 3
 (Passenger) Can't add more then one passenger for some reason. Frustrating.

Version 2.1 2013-01-19 4
 (Gorgeous app!) Gorgeous app. Really easy to and just beautiful.

Version 2.1 2013-01-19 1
 (Yuck) App is easy to use, but when trying to search for a flight the only options are for departure and arrival airport and dates. Not able to say dates are flexible...

Version 2.1 2013-01-19 5
 (Expedia) Great app!

Version 2.1 2013-01-19 1
 (Bogus) No flight info, just hotels. Deceptive.

Version 2.1 2013-01-18 5
 (Great!!!!!!) AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!

Version 2.1 2013-01-18 5
 (Impressed!) Super, super easy to book a hotel. I was impressed! Also, if you search and then close the app (even remove it from the multi-tasking), when you open it again it will remember exactly what you searched for!
My only complaint is you can't search by the number of stars a hotel has, only the rating given by users. Otherwise, I'd use again!

Version 2.1 2013-01-18 5
 (Love it!) Super easy to use and is very fast.

Version 2.1 2013-01-18 5
 (Fantastic app) I just booked my holiday through Expedia app was really easy and fun I recommend everyone to use it. 
Thanks

Version 2.1 2013-01-17 3
 (Mr) It was easy to use for booking a room, but I couldn't find a way to add a rental car to the room.

Version 2.1 2013-01-17 1
 (Not a good app does not link to your profile in Expedia.) Not useful.

Version 2.1 2013-01-17 1
 (Horrible) Really?  Really Expedia?
Shame shame shame.

Version 2.1 2013-01-17 1
 (Useless) No support for flights! They should rename this to just "Expedia Hotels".

Version 2.1 2013-01-16 5
 (Great App!!!) 👍👍✈🏨😊

Version 2.1 2013-01-15 1
 (Does not gave an option for multiple passengers.  What is that?  Stupidapp!!!) Bad really wast of time. 
1 star is too much.

Version 2.1 2013-01-14 1
 (Where's the flight search?) App title says flight and hotel. Don't waste your time. Come on Expedia!

Version 2.1 2013-01-14 1
 (Worst app ever) Really?  Don't waste you're time.  This app is useless.

Version 2.1 2013-01-13 1
 (Useless!) This app is completely useless! I wasn't able to do anything that I assumed I could do with the app.... Like search flights etc. Deleting this app right away.

Version 2.1 2013-01-13 4
 (Great app!) Super easy to use! Very convenient for booking a hotel. Loved the ability to see the map & move around.

Version 2.1 2013-01-13 1
 (Seriously?) Ok, what is the one thing you might want to do with an Expedia app?....Search for flights right?  Apparently Expedia has not figured out how to do this.  Save your time and download a real travel app. Sorry Expedia...not sure you deserve the one star I gave you. :(

Version 2.1 2013-01-12 1
 (Expedia) I, too, am not seeing the option to look up and book flights. I am only presented with a map and list of hotels. Useless for me without flight booking.

Version 2.1 2013-01-12 1
 (No Fligth Search) You can't search for flights.

Version 2.1 2013-01-12 1
 (Not good) I agree!! they need to completely revamp this App, Cant believe they released it!

Version 2.1 2013-01-12 1
 (Now options!!) You can not add more people and all prices are one way! No round trip option! Waist of time!

Version 2.1 2013-01-12 1
 (Awful!) Can't find round trip selection and the app won't let you back out and Chang dates. Stupid.

Version 2.0 2013-01-12 5
 (Very easy) Very easy to use. Save peak time.

Very easy to use. Save peak time.

Version 2.1 2013-01-11 1
 (Really!? how do you select more passengers!!!?) !!!

Version 2.1 2013-01-11 5
 (Nice!) Very easy to use. Gave me a gazillion choices!

Version 2.1 2013-01-11 5
 (Super Easy) Have only used it once so far, but was super easy to use and very user friendly.

Version 2.1 2013-01-10 5
 (Very slick) This app was a breeze to use. Wow!

Version 2.1 2013-01-10 2
 (Not helpful) This app was not helpful.

Version 2.1 2013-01-09 5
 (Only App I Use) I have always used Expedia for a great deal of my travels. The newly designed app for my droid and my iPad is so easy to use and I really like the layout. It just motivates me to use it more. It's so quick and easy. If you don't use the app, you're missing out.

Version 2.1 2013-01-09 4
 (Just Fine) There are so many reviews stating that this app only offers hotels and not flights. If that were the case, it's not a problem for me because I drive a few hours to my home away from home, San Francisco. But, I'm confused because on the main menu page it shows at the top "Hotels" on the left,"FLIGHTS" on the right. Very easy to see. The website doesn't feature the hotel+flights+rental option. So, if you use that option frequently, this app won't be satisfactory. But, it moves more smoothly than compared to the internet site on my iPhone and I've had no problems with it. If you're debating whether to download it, it's free, and if you don't like it you can always delete it.

Version 2.1 2013-01-08 1
 (Slim features) The app has cool animation features but I was hoping I would have access to my Expedia itineraries and/or could tie together my complete travel plans even if I did not purchase via Expedia. 

I'll be deleting the app since I would rather use the kayak app to search for flights, hotels, etc

Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
 (No flights) I am mystified why this was released with no flight functionality. Completely useless to me, as I rarely stay in hotels. And with no explanation of this, I spent long minutes staring at the app, trying to unlock the secret room that would allow me to search for flights. This would be like downloading a Yahoo Email app and then having it only let you look at Flickr pictures.

Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
 (No flights) Crap, just use Safari. No flight search (or booking), and I only need flights, not hotels.

Version 2.1 2013-01-07 5
 (Tim) Nice clean room for an xlnt price. Staff service very good.

Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
 (No flights?) Can I give this zero stars?

Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
 (Hotels only?) Change the misleading name, to Expedia Hotels, since it has nothing to do with flights.

Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
 (Horrible app) It's well design with effects and stuff, but doesn't even offer the basics from the website, like combining flight+hotel+car (actually it doesn't even offer car rental at all), and believe it or not this app won't even allow you to book a flight for 2 persons, you gotta buy 2 separate tickets. Get it together Expedia, I decided to buy my package through Orbitz since you can't deliver...

Version 2.1 2013-01-06 2
 (1/2 the app 1/2 the stars) I first purchased the app for the iPhone then added it to my iPad for convenience. This app is great for booking hotels. Simple easy to use and easy to understand. Where it falls short is in booking flights. The problem is you can't book them. Only with the iPhone app can you book flights. The app icon clearly indicates that flight booking is available within the app and Expedia is known for booking flights. Though this is not the case. I recommend if you want to book a flight via Expedia on your iPad use Safari instead of the Expedia app.

Version 2.1 2013-01-05 5
 (Convenient!) Did a bunch of research on different hotels that was easy, fast, and had all the information I needed. Also booked a hotel and it was very simple and fast. Great app!

Version 2.1 2013-01-05 5
 (Super fast) Used the app on my phone to book a hotel and flight for a weekend getaway in seconds! Great mobile deals on hotels in Vegas!

Version 2.1 2013-01-04 1
 (SRSLY?) It's called "Expedia Hotels & Fights."

But it only has hotels. And I only need flights.

Words fail.

Version 2.1 2013-01-04 2
 (Where's the old App???) Pretty ridiculous that you can't book for multiple people as well as your flight and hotel together. Although I'm seeing flights, I can only book one way tickets??  The fact that it looks good is the only good thing this app has going for it unless you're only flying one way or just looking for a hotel.

Version 2.1 2013-01-04 5
 (Great app. Easy use for traveler.) Booked a perfect three person room in Florence, Italy in less than five minutes. Easy payment entry and booking. Would recommend to anyone.

Version 2.1 2013-01-04 1
 (No help) No multi city option, no flight and hotel option. Just use safari.

Version 2.1 2013-01-04 1
 (Cannot book for multiple person) Really shocked to see that the application cannot book flights for multiple persons. I tried to book flights for my wife and my 6 year old but can only do one person at a time. So I booked my wife's ticket first and tried to book my son's. But the app won't let me because my son is not 18 yet. I had to call Expedia to rebook everything. What a waste of time.

Version 2.1 2013-01-04 1
 (Flights???) There is no capability to search for flights!?!

Version 2.1 2013-01-03 5
 (The best, but need social sharing) my favorite booking app , but need to add social network & email to share .

Version 2.1 2013-01-03 4
 (Worked like a gem) World like a gem!

Version 2.1 2013-01-03 3
 (Finds flights) Not sure about other reviews - looks like it finds flights to me

Version 2.1 2013-01-03 3
 (Good place to stay) Last night my girlfriend and I traveled to Boston and asked for a room at last minute via mobile advertising, we didn't know we had to make a deposit otherwise we couldn't stay there. The room was very clean and quiet. We liked the place, very nice. We'll go back soon.

Version 2.1 2013-01-03 1
 (WHERE ARE THE FLIGHTS?) It would be better if they remove the Flight part of the name of the app since there are no place to be found. It is only for Hotels.

Version 2.1 2013-01-02 1
 (Double charges) Used this app to reserve 1 night each at 2 separate hotels and was double charged both times. Once by the hotel and once by Expedia for the full price of the stay each time.  Thanks for wasting my money and time.

Version 2.1 2013-01-02 1
 ('and flights'?) Why call an app 'hotels and flights' when there is no 'flights' functionality in the app?. Uninstalling immediately.

Version 2.1 2013-01-02 1
 (What?) It's called Expedia Hotel & Flights, but you can't look up the prices with "hotels and flights"...... Something misleading about that.

Version 2.1 2013-01-01 1
 (Not Functional) This app only allows you to search in certain areas. Lacks details on hotels, just an overall disappointment.

Version 2.1 2012-12-31 1
 (Terrible) Only flight and hotel options.

Version 2.1 2012-12-31 1
 (Frustration) Easy to Book a flight for yourself but where is the multiple traveler option? Expedia can only book one flyer at a time? Stupid!!!

Version 2.1 2012-12-31 1
 (Stupid app for iPad) This only shows hotels, not flights. This is nothing like the Expedia website.

Version 2.1 2012-12-31 1
 (terrible no flights.) this app is hotels only for ipads....stinks!!

Version 2.1 2012-12-30 4
 (Where's the flight) The hotel part of the app is very easy and user friendly. But I am unable to book a flight. What's up with that?

Version 2.1 2012-12-30 1
 (No way to see flights on iPad!!) I love this app on my iPhone because it opens with a choice between flights and hotels. No such luck on the iPad--you can only see hotels. Do not recommend!!

Version 2.1 2012-12-30 5
 (Piece of cake) People that gave this one star are not smart. To book return flight simply follow the direction at the top of the departure calendar, that is, tap the return date also. I give one star givers one star, and this is only my second app ever.

Version 2.1 2012-12-30 5
 (JetsetATL) Expedia is my go-to for discount travel. Very pleased with the app; however I've only used it on my phone for BOTH flight and hotel purchases. Not sure why it would operate differently on the iPad.

Version 2.0 2012-12-30 4
 (Like) Very user friendly! Can book a hotel in about 2 minutes. And love how it sends a confirmation e-mail! 😀

Version 2.1 2012-12-29 5
 (Expedia app) Amazingly easy to use, great when you're on the road and need to MKE bookings on the fly. Only used it for hotels though, but all worked smoothlessly.

Version 2.1 2012-12-29 1
 (Flights? What flights?) Would be nice if there were a way to get flight info on the iPad. Seriously??????

Version 2.1 2012-12-29 1
 (Why say FLIGHT. And hotel?) Just say hotel. Where is flight info? Title of the app is very misleading.

Version 2.1 2012-12-29 1
 (Needs flights) search for flight bring it to iPad !!!!!!

Version 2.1 2012-12-29 1
 (only one way fly why??? why???) why!

Version 2.1 2012-12-29 1
 (Just google it.) Free Luna Blue Hotel! Expedia doesn't respect consumers or small businesses.  Just google your destination, and yelp it to find the best travel values. Always book directly from the hotels, airlines, and rental co.

Version 2.1 2012-12-28 1
 (Useless) No flight booking or info on the iPad. Totally useless.

Version 2.1 2012-12-27 5
 (Wonderful app!) Very convenient and functional! Highly recommended!

Version 2.1 2012-12-27 1
 (Useless) Why does it only show one way flights???

Version 2.0 2012-12-27 5
 (Awesome App) Even easier than using the website!

Version 2.1 2012-12-27 5
 (Great App) Easy to use and navigate. Get the guy who made this app a fat bonus.

Version 2.1 2012-12-27 1
 (Useless) Can't book or look up flights. Why bother putting this piece of crap out to the public

Version 2.1 2012-12-27 1
 (Not very friendly) Why can't you select packages on the app? I can't even change the number of travellers. I would not install this app again as it is not very user friendly.

Version 2.1 2012-12-26 5
 (Easy to use!) Easy to use!

Version 2.1 2012-12-26 1
 (Apps-less) Great Hotel app for the iPad. No flight app for the iPad. Note hotel and flight on iPhone.  Missed the mark on iPad.

Version 2.1 2012-12-26 2
 (No flights) Apps looks great, but there is only one very bad problem, there is no way to book flights. Nice omission Expedia!

Version 2.1 2012-12-26 5
 (User friendly) Extremely easy and very user friendly

Version 2.1 2012-12-26 1
 (Who created this POS app?) Expedia is about to lose my business. Can never check out with either of my saved credit cards. Have had to either call or pay full price. Very inconvenient while on the road. Expedia customer service is too gabby for my taste. Should learn the art of being succinct. That's why I would prefer to book via smart phone.

Version 2.1 2012-12-26 2
 (Flight?) If this is called hotels & FLIGHTS, why is there no place to look up flights?

Version 2.1 2012-12-25 1
 (Packages?) How about package deals that include both hotel and air?

Version 2.1 2012-12-25 5
 (Fantastic app) Brilliant app. Great work. Fantastic user experience.

Version 2.1 2012-12-24 5
 (Hotel Reservations) Ridiculously Easy! I love this app for booking stays. Easy easy easy!

Version 2.1 2012-12-24 4
 (Hotel reservations) This app works great for hotel reservations.  Easy to search, easy to look at maps for location details, and fast.  I made a hotel reservation in about 3 minutes.  A nice timesaver.

Version 2.1 2012-12-24 1
 (Useless) I downloaded this app to look up flights and I can't see any flight information only hotels. Get it together Expedia

Version 2.1 2012-12-24 1
 (Too complicated) Too complicated, doesn't give enough info about flight details also how to select more than 1 passenger?

Version 2.1 2012-12-23 5
 (Great App.) The interface is easy to use for booking the hotel. Passbook integration is super nice!

Version 2.1 2012-12-23 1
 (Horrible) This is ridiculous. There is no way to look up flights. Terrible interface. Once you are in the hotel lookup, it's impossible to figure out how to look up flights. F-, poooooor design.

Version 2.1 2012-12-23 1
 (Not even close to Kayak) Difficult to use and not even possible to book flights.

Version 2.1 2012-12-22 1
 (Seriously?) Are u kidding??  You can't even look up flights on an App for hotels and flights.  Nice work.

Version 2.1 2012-12-21 5
 (Just booked a Vegas hotel.) Fast, straight forward and simple. Works for me.

Version 2.1 2012-12-21 1
 (Not worth the trouble) You can't book for multiple people.

Version 2.1 2012-12-21 5
 (Great app) Great prices, easy to use, very convenient

Version 2.1 2012-12-20 4
 (Still missing key features) Adding multiple travelers

Version 2.0 2012-12-19 4
 (Near perfect) Love it. One of the most dynamic and user friendly travel apps ever. The only thing missing is access to itinerary & purchase history info.

Version 2.0 2012-12-19 5
 (Awesome) Very user friendly, one of the best apps ever.

Version 2.0 2012-12-18 5
 (Easy and amazing) This was faster and easier than the website. Thank you Steve jobs. Thank you expedia.

Version 2.0 2012-12-18 5
 (The best) Good and easy app

Version 2.0 2012-12-17 5
 (Good, quick booking) I'm happier with this app than I thought I'd be. I'm on a cross country road trip and just booking hotels as I travel based on how far I feel like going each day. This app has made it super easy!

Version 2.0 2012-12-17 5
 (Excelente) This app is excellent. We have been waiting for too long for a good Expedia app and this is it. Amazing!

Version 2.0 2012-12-16 3
 (Fantastic App!!!!!!) App made booking a hotel extremely easy & received Best Price Available! THANK YOU for taking the worry out of travel. One less thing to stress over during the Holidays!

Version 2.0 2012-12-16 1
 (Not good) This app great for booking but no function to tracking my flight, wreack,

Version 2.0 2012-12-16 5
 (Good app) Works well, updates are nice.

Version 2.0 2012-12-15 5
 (Excellences of service) This is a great tool! Keep up the good work

Version 2.0 2012-12-15 1
 (No ability to review flights?) Where are your marketing folks? Amazing way to wreck a brand!

Version 2.0 2012-12-14 5
 (Travel) Very quick and easy!

Version 2.0 2012-12-14 2
 (Doesn't allow for multiple travelers) The flight search is great, except I want to book a flight for me and my wife (2 travelers) and there is no capability to book a multiple traveler trip.

Version 2.0 2012-12-13 1
 (Wow...no flights for ipad?) The Expedia site keeps telling me I'm not choosing in between the proper dates and now I can't a flight because the app flight schedules either....how stupid is that?

Version 2.0 2012-12-13 5
 (Great for hotel reservations) Very easy, straightforward and good deals

Version 2.0 2012-12-12 5
 (Good) Like

Version 2.0 2012-12-12 1
 (Ho humm...) Says it is for hotels and flights... No flight capability. Grrrr.

Version 2.0 2012-12-12 5
 (Awesome app) Awesome app... Never use anything else to book travel. Easy to use and always has the best deals.

Version 2.0 2012-12-12 4
 (Convenient) Great app. Easy to use. Round trips are available despite what people say, but it's hard to see. Upgrade I would suggest is having a place to view all your itineraries

Version 2.0 2012-12-11 5
 (best travel app in the UNIVERSE!) everything about this app is brilliant - the windows, backgrounds of the city you search for, easy-to-use interface and so much small details! 
you should check this app even if you don't really wanna buy a ticket.

Version 2.0 2012-12-11 1
 (Useless for searching for a flight) App opens up ready to search for a hotel but there is no way to search for a flight.

Version 2.0 2012-12-11 5
 (Liked it a lot) not bad really helped on my vacation!

Version 2.0 2012-12-10 1
 (Not good enough) No round trip for the flights, I hope it's gonna be better

Version 2.0 2012-12-10 5
 (Great) This new app is great, very easy to book hotels!

Version 2.0 2012-12-10 5
 (So amazing!) Booked a hotel and checked-in 10 minutes later!  So easy and so awesome!

Version 2.0 2012-12-10 1
 (Mr) I just did a hotel only search and could get "no results" for Seattle San Francisco and new York city. Messed up.

Version 2.0 2012-12-09 1
 (iPad version) I don't see any way of booking flights, just hotels.  I'd like to see the ability to book flights, hotels and cars all in the same place and at the same time on my iPad.  Until then I guess I'll stick to my computer.  :-(

Version 2.0 2012-12-09 4
 (Expedia app is awesome) This app is more useful that Expedia website. User friendly

Version 2.0 2012-12-08 5
 (Love it) Love this App!! Easy to use and compatible with passbook!!

Version 2.0 2012-12-08 1
 (I would give it zero stars) The iPad version is fairly useless - doesn't do much except for some pretty col animation. Stick to the web site

Version 2.0 2012-12-08 4
 (Works Great) Excellent app.  Intuitive and simple.  Does the job with minimum hassle.

Version 2.0 2012-12-08 5
 (Works great!) Wish had more hotel options only.

Version 2.0 2012-12-08 4
 (Easy to USA) I like it.

Version 2.0 2012-12-07 1
 (Doesn't work the way it's supposed to) The app only shows the hotel search page, not the flights, and I can't log in to my account. There doesn't appear to be a main menu to select from on the iPad version.

Version 2.0 2012-12-07 5
 (Easy) Great app reservation done in munutes

Version 2.0 2012-12-06 5
 (Great app) Very helpful for my vacation to the Florida Keys.

Version 2.0 2012-12-06 5
 (Fast and easy) Reserving is easy. Only problem is that you can't add spa packages from what I saw, but that can be added later.

Version 2.0 2012-12-06 2
 (No Packages...) This app has the greatest UI for booking flights that I have ever seen. Unfortunately I can't use it as I usually need to add a rental car to my booking. Please add packages !!!!

Version 2.0 2012-12-06 4
 (Expedia) It works! That's all ya need to know when you're on the road an need a room like we did. A little thin on content. That's why only 4 stars. Keep up the good work! Thanks.

Version 2.0 2012-12-05 5
 (Great App) Nice app. It's flawless. Full descriptions of the hotels we were considering were at our finger tips. Nice crisp clear photos of the properties. We booked two rooms it took less than 5 minutes.

Version 2.0 2012-12-05 3
 (Multi city) Can anybody tell me how to search multi city flights? Thanks!

Version 2.0 2012-12-05 4
 (Needs a few tweaks) Need a space to add special requests on booking (hotels). Need option to sorting results by price high to low, AND low to high...same with ratings.

Version 2.0 2012-12-03 3
 (Hm) Hm

Version 2.0 2012-12-03 5
 (Best rates) I was stuck at CDG in Paris - within 2 mins of downloading the app, I had found the best rate, booked and paid for room.  Effortless process

Version 2.0 2012-12-03 4
 (Good for hotels) Only used for hotels good location based and deal based choices, like the layout

Version 2.0 2012-12-03 1
 (Junk) No airport code cross reference?  What a joke.  So you expect me to Google airport codes and then go back into your worthless app?  Joke.

Version 2.0 2012-12-02 2
 (No iPad!) This app will not show the flight menu in your iPad. Will show only hotels.

Version 2.0 2012-12-01 5
 (Amazing) Not only is it fun and pretty, but you can book right from the app!!!  Great work!

Version 2.0 2012-12-01 2
 (Doesn't work for flights!?) Did Expedia really release an app that doesn't allow you to search for flights by class, non-stop or airline? Is this really Expedia?

Version 2.0 2012-11-30 5
 (Love this app!) I already love Expedia online but once I got my iPhone I'm now hooked to this app when I travel. Combine it with passbook and google maps and its all I need for the perfect vacation planner!

Version 2.0 2012-11-29 5
 (Hoteles) Excelente app para reserva de hoteles. Me fue bien con las reservas en Argentina y el exterior.

Version 2.0 2012-11-29 1
 (Can't book flights) I don't know why they advertise you can use this to book flights. It's for hotels only.

Version 2.0 2012-11-29 1
 (Can't book a flight) App is showing hotels only and no flight options!

Version 2.0 2012-11-28 1
 (Not a useful app) This app does not give you the flexibilty of choosing what can be useful options such as time ranges, flight options like direct or 1-Stop. 2-Stop etc, for flights you want to search for. Also I cannot see anywhere in the application configuration where I can add my persona Expedia account information. Where is that? Even if its there somewhere, it is not very intuitive as I was not able to locate it.

I do not think I will ever use this app to actually make any reservations or bookings. I do not see a real good use this app can be put to so may even delete it later..

Version 2.0 2012-11-28 1
 (Can't book flights!) Seriously. Seems like a blatant limitation and false advertising for an app named "Expedia Hotels & FLIGHTS." If you need to book a flight, look somewhere else.

Version 2.0 2012-11-28 3
 (Tapjoy) Downloading for free platnium.

Version 2.0 2012-11-27 2
 (Not for "Managing" your Expedia Trips) Very pretty.  Good UI and overall a nice App for booking travel.  But let's be clear, this  does not allow you to manage already booked trips via Expedia.  On Expedia site is says download the App to  "Manage your trip--any trip--on your iPhone! Get flight status alerts with the FREE app from Expedia"  Just not accurate.  The description on iTunes is much more accurate.  Great for generating new biz, but ignores those of us already on board.

Version 2.0 2012-11-27 1
 (app did not work) Installed app. 5 attempts to get flight info from Atlanta to Washington DC.

3 times the app displayed an error message "500 cannot connect to server". 2 times the app sat and spun when trying to load data.

Version 2.0 2012-11-26 1
 (Don't book anything! It's stupid) No star
I only booked one room through this app, but the hotel shows I booked FOUR ROOMS by itself!
And it took Expedia more than half hour to figure out what's happening and cancel the extra rooms. 

People, be careful with this app.  

Even though I like the layout of the new update but it seems still having lot of bugs. So PLEASE fix the bug.

Version 2.0 2012-11-24 5
 (Easy and convenient booking!) Very easy to use.  Took me a few mins to figure out how to change default values but one I got that it was super easy to use!

Version 2.0 2012-11-24 5
 (AWESOME!!!) Fast And Easy! One Of My Fav. Apps Hands Down!!!😝👍👍👍

Version 2.0 2012-11-24 5
 (Great App!) This App is so easy to use. My wife and I were on a road trip in California and needed a to book a last minute place to stay for a night. This App told us what hotels had availability in the area and booking the hotel was fast and easy.

Version 2.0 2012-11-23 4
 (Alkesh Gandhi) Great application. Easy to use. good offers. Hotel booking was never so easy.

Version 2.0 2012-11-23 5
 (Very easy to use) Very easy to use.

Version 2.0 2012-11-22 5
 (Best travel app on the App Store) The new app is fantastic. Really functional and well thought out.

Version 2.0 2012-11-22 4
 (Good app) Good app! Easy to use! Flights soon so it should be better! Also it would be great to link the Expedia point account directly to the app. Overall super special! Specially to Vegas! Would recommend this app!

Version 2.0 2012-11-22 5
 (Awesome for last minute mobile bookings!) In Nola with no hotel in Thanksgiving day - in comes Expedia. Awesome, easy, and fast. $71 for two people in 3.5 star hotel with breakfast included. Yah!

Version 2.0 2012-11-22 1
 (Only hotels on iPad app) Uninstalled since cannot book flights.

Version 2.0 2012-11-21 3
 (Pretty good but needs work) The app is good but there are some missing elements. The biggest one for me is not being able to buy for one traveler at the same time. Or if there is a way, it's not very intuitive on how to change it.

Version 2.0 2012-11-21 5
 (Awesome App!) Easy to use, and very attractive to look at. Retina users rejoice!!

Version 2.0 2012-11-21 5
 (Awesome App!) This app was perfect for booking rooms. Showed reviews, pics and a way to link with PassBook. The only thing was that I couldn't book two rooms in one reservation. No button to select number of rooms only guests. Had to do two reservations.

Version 2.0 2012-11-20 5
 (Perfect perfect perfect) Easy to navigate ,very simple and easy I love it

Version 2.0 2012-11-19 5
 (Easy to use!) Thank you for creating an App that works great on the go.

Version 2.0 2012-11-19 1
 (Crappy) No flexible date support (+/- 3 days). You cannot buy more than one person's ticket in one go :( The only star is for the airplane window you see and can open and shut when the app is finding tickets. :)

Version 2.0 2012-11-19 5
 (ninja) Super easy to use. Love the zoom in feature on photo and map modules.

Version 2.0 2012-11-19 4
 (Multiple rooms booking) App should allow to book multiple rooms like on the regular Expedia web site on your PC - otherwise great app.

Version 2.0 2012-11-19 5
 (wonderful app) this is absolutely amazing! love it!

Version 2.0 2012-11-19 4
 (works well) very useful

Version 2.0 2012-11-18 5
 (Great design) Simple and friendly. Love it

Version 2.0 2012-11-18 5
 (Great app) Very simple and intuitive functions. Love that they have TripAdvisor reviews. Just excellent.

Version 2.0 2012-11-18 5
 (Impressive update!) Didn't like the previous version, but I really like how it turns out now! Great job! :) and if I can sign in my expedia account, it would be awesome!

Version 2.0 2012-11-18 5
 (Great app) Easy to use, good looking.

Version 2.0 2012-11-17 1
 (Sign in) I can't sign into my account! Please fix ASAP :/

Version 2.0 2012-11-17 5
 (Clean!!) Awesome new UI and simplified UX. Love this app update!

Version 2.0 2012-11-17 1
 (Back to the drawing board, Expedia) I downloaded the new Expedia app and attempted to book a flight for my husband and I on my iPad, but the option was not available. Next, I went to book the flights on my phone, but I wasn't able to book a flight for two at the same time. Being able to book for more than one person at a time seems like basic functionality. Back to the drawing board, Expedia. 

I ended up booking the flights using the Orbitz app. I was able to book both flights at once. I also received a coupon code for 15% off of my hotel booking. Win, win Orbitz!

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
 (Simple and brilliant) Good UX, straight to the point

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 1
 (Only hotels?) The iPad version seems to only let you book hotels.  Useless, because I only use Expedia for flights.  Correct me if I'm wrong?

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
 (Gorgeous new app!) Everything is so smooth and beautiful. They really kicked it up a notch.

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
 (Reservations) So,so easy, I should have used it before now!!!

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
 (The best hotel app) I love that it downloads all of the hotels at once. It makes searchin so much faster.  I travel 2 times a month and this saves me loads of time when I have to make last minute reservations on the go.

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
 (Best App icon ever!) Wish all developers pay more attention to App icon, because its gonna hang there on our home screen for a while, so make it worth it , beautiful and realistic! 

-Travel Application must all follow a Pattern so we can have a wonderful Travel page on our home screen that we are proud to show off to everyone
  +like the suit case ( you used)
  +a Ticket Maybe
  +Airplane (3D-like) or just fin 
  +Pilot hat (popping out like if it is really there on the home scree!)

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 4
 (Wow) Newest version is awesome. Flights, hotels, all so easy and looks sharp.

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
 (Awesome) This app makes life easy.

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 1
 (Happy Place) App does not work on iPad very well. Deleted it. How can I give zero stars?

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 3
 (!!!) Amazing app. Beautiful design. But can't log in my Expedia account!! Hope do some corrections soon.

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
 (Wonderful) This app is visually stunning. Everything about the design makes you excited to travel - even the loading page! It runs smoothly, and is a joy to use.

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 1
 (Virtually useless on iPad) Can't search for flights on iPad; can't sign in to my Expedia info. Useless until they come out with an iPad app.  Deleted it.

Version 1.5 2012-11-16 1
 (I rather call hotel direct.) Next time I will called hotel directly so I knows my room is on bottom floor. Also front desk clerk gave me free upgrade. Front desk clerk told me that most hotels would match all online rates if you call hotels directly and may also give free upgrade or promotional rate better than online rates. It's better to give a try calling hotels directly before making reservations online.

Version 2.0 2012-11-15 5
 (Amazing) I really can't quite believe how beautiful and functional this app is. Truly amazing and a must for everyone who is on the road a lot to add to their phone.

Version 2.0 2012-11-15 5
 (Impressed) Best travel booking app ever!!! The flight layover bar is so easy and visually appealing!

Version 2.0 2012-11-15 1
 (Lots of bugs) Lots of bugs. Won't pick up my location so I can book a room tonight!

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
 (This App is beautiful) The reverse waterfall home page that shows local hotel deals helped me find a great hotel deal for my road trip to Seattle. And the flights shopping experience is so good. I would recommend to my friends!

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
 (Amazing app) That's the sexiest iPhone app I've used so far. So easy so slick. Must use

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 2
 (Question???) How do I buy 2 tickets at once??? 2 Travelers!!!

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
 (Brilliant update) The flight search feature is incredibly easy to use and does a great job depicting flight time and duration. Same with the hotel search.

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 1
 (Not Seeing It!) I'm not seeing any search capability on my iPhone 5 with this latest update. Seems to work OK on the iPad. Appears frozen on the Visible Map area hotel search.

Anyone else detect a lemon?

LCBenz

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
 (Love the new interface!) It looks great, is functional, and booking a flight was AWESOME! Awesome job, Expedia Team!

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 4
 (Good app - but not seeing flights on iPad) Nice interface, flights available in iPhone but not on iPad. What's up with that?

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
 (Real smooth!) Booking flights is a breeze w this app! The clever UI makes it a rival even to the web sites. Easy to find the best matching flight based on price, times and duration. I like how simple it is to book for family and save their deets for later. Would like to see how changing the dates a bit impacts the price, manual selection of seats and when there are limited seats left.

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
 (Beautiful, fun and easy) This app makes finding the best flight fun and easy. You can feel all the time and attention they poured into this beautiful app.

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
 (WOW!!!!!!) I'm seriously luving the layout of the this new app. Great job guys! :)

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
 (Beautiful app) This app has always been useful and gives great rates and discounts, but now the UI is top notch. The UI change wasn't needed but very welcomed.

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 3
 (Where are the flights?) Anyone else not seeing flight options on iPad? I see on the iPhone after the update,but nothing on the iPad. Was hoping they'd made a better app, not so sure now.

Version 2.0 2012-11-14 2
 (How do I look at existing reservations?) App is great for booking a room, but after booking how do I see that reservation again within the app?  For instance, after a reservation I hit 'no' for  a passbook entry.  Then I wanted to add a passbook card for the reservation later but there is no option to view itineraries. Take a cue from airline apps like the United app. I want to be able to open this Expedia app and see app based and web based itineraries. I want to be able to add a passbook card after the point of initial reservation.

Version 1.6 2012-11-12 5
 (Best prices on hotels) The mobile app has better rates than Priceline! Love the design and the fact my credit card info is saved for later.

Version 1.6 2012-11-12 4
 (Good enough) Easy to use and fast but can't seem to book multiple rooms.

Version 1.6 2012-11-10 5
 (Easy!) Very easy to use! Very fast booking time!! Awesome app!!!

Version 1.6 2012-11-10 4
 (Great App!) The only missing function is to be able to use maps to get directions of how to get to the hotel before booking it. 
Besides that it is prefect!

Version 1.6 2012-11-10 5
 (Awesome Stay) I booked a room 1 hour before checking in and it was awesome. No issues with my reservation.

Version 1.6 2012-11-07 5
 (Bekaar) Excellent hotel, would stay every time I am in Houston

Version 1.5 2012-11-07 4
 (Expedia iPhone App) Good app. Easy to use and quick. I don't think it lists all of the hotels available on the Web site.

Version 1.6 2012-11-07 1
 (????) I keep trying to open it and it won't 'allow' it! Frustrating! I even reset the phone, after deleting and reinstalling!! What gives

Version 1.6 2012-11-07 5
 (Très pratique et utile) App très utile. Facile à utiliser et en plus très esthétique :) j'adore.

Version 1.6 2012-11-06 4
 (Good App) Quick, easy, very clear. Setting the dates was a little challenge but no complaints here

Version 1.6 2012-11-06 4
 (Info) Nothing but the truth!! Works for me.

Version 1.6 2012-11-05 5
 (Fast and convenient!!!!) I was at work and needed to book a hotel quickly and easily on my iPhone.  This ap worked perfect!!!!

Version 1.6 2012-11-05 1
 (Poor phone service poor room) Got a horrible experience being transferred from front desk . The woman on the phone was so rude and did not care to help . We paid for a pool side view , and next to our room was a huge fan ! We couldn't sleep all nite

Version 1.6 2012-11-05 5
 (Excellent) Reliable, fast and supportive...

Version 1.6 2012-11-04 5
 (Amazing~!) I use this app while I'm on the go. It shows great deals and is very up to date. I like that it shows the hotels in your surrounding area and elsewhere for quick information! Very useful for quick hotel bookings.

Version 1.6 2012-11-04 4
 (Great) Too easy, no issues here. So far I love it!

Version 1.6 2012-11-02 3
 (Nice App. But) It is very nice app but it would be gr8 if they would add flight booking also.

Version 1.6 2012-11-02 5
 (Great) Great app

Version 1.6 2012-11-02 5
 (Great app) Easy to use. No problems. Works well with passbook.

Version 1.6 2012-11-02 5
 (Easy as 1-2-3) Straight to the point. No hassle.

Version 1.6 2012-10-30 5
 (Excellent!!!!!!!! I can't live without this app.) MUST HAVE!!!

Version 1.6 2012-10-29 3
 (Rude.) I hope this is a joke. The counter attendant made us wait holding our bags at her check in desk while she smoked a cigarette with another hotel employee outside. After a 6 hour drive in a storm, I would've never expected that the rudeness of this employee would've been the worst part of the drive. Nice location though.

Version 1.6 2012-10-28 1
 (Expedia ruined my trip) I paid 180$ for a room using Expedia app. When I got to the hotel the front desk informed me that they only charge 109$ for the room. Very terrible never using them again and would not recommend them to anyone make a couple phone calls save 50-% shame on you Expedia for advertising your self as making good deals and instead marking the price up 100%

Version 1.6 2012-10-26 5
 (Love it!!) Out of the 3 hotel apps I looked at this was the best design & most importantly best deal & description. I like that there is a link for everything you can think of. Even to do the google map thing where u stand in the middle of the street. Loved it!

Version 1.6 2012-10-26 5
 (Sweet App) Very well designed!

Version 1.5 2012-10-26 5
 (Awesome App - one of my most used) I use this all the time when traveling - highly recommend!

Version 1.6 2012-10-23 5
 (Great App!) I used this app to book a stay in San Diego with my dog.  It worked great and I found a great deal!

Version 1.6 2012-10-23 5
 (Outstanding) Outstanding app. Intuitive. Easy. Reliable. Customer oriented. Info is well presented. I book my hotel nights in minutes, with great prices , all information I need, and other customer feedback. A must app !

Version 1.6 2012-10-22 5
 (5 Star App!!) Intuitive, friendly, stable app.  Love it!

Version 1.6 2012-10-21 5
 (Quick and easy) I downloaded the app and was able to find and purchase a hotel room in less than 5 mins. Really great and I know I will use it a lot.

Version 1.6 2012-10-20 4
 (Review) Very easy to navigate and plenty of options

Version 1.6 2012-10-20 5

Version 1.6 2012-10-19 5
 (Very good) Very good

Version 1.6 2012-10-16 4
 (Just hotel no flights!) Overall, it's a good app. I like the mobile exclusive rates. It's cheaper!

Version 1.6 2012-10-16 5
 (Great App!) Super easy to use and had everything I needed to book hotels and save lots of money.

Version 1.6 2012-10-15 1
 (I'm in trouble) I tried this app it looks nice is functional but it screwed me real nicely. I booked 1 room and the app was real generous and gave me two rooms instead. I have used this app before and never had a problem so I know how to use it. So now I get $400 deducted from my bank account instead of $200. I remember reading a review about this happening to someone else but just figured they did something wrong. Now I'm the guy. I will just use this app for reference and never  book anything with it. By the way to try and get this cleared up with Expedia you have to leave a call back number with a 1 to 2hr wait. Hope I don't bounce any checks waiting to get my money back. Hope this doesn't happen to you.

Version 1.5 2012-10-14 2
 (Double charges) I like the convenience of the app and ease of booking. Too bad it's double charged me for a room, twice! 4 hours on the phone to get my money back.

Version 1.6 2012-10-12 5
 (Very helpful app!) I was able to get all info necessary to make the best hotel choice very quickly. Easy to navigate and thorough information. Booking was fast and easy. Will definitely use this app for my future travels!

Version 1.6 2012-10-12 5
 (Wow) Really easy to use, and fast!

Version 1.6 2012-10-11 5
 (Very easy to use) Found this app easy to use and quick

Version 1.6 2012-10-11 5
 (Easiest hotel booking app ever!) This app makes vacations more enjoyable.

Version 1.6 2012-10-09 5
 (Fantastic) Amazing and user friendly!

Version 1.6 2012-10-09 5
 (Very easy) For those of us who are Expedia aficionados this app is awesomely easy to use. I just booked a hotel on the cheap rapidly between clients.

Version 1.6 2012-10-08 2
 (Could be more useful) I love Expedia & book all my students & professors through them.  I would love if their app allowed me access to my trips, my account & details without transferring me to their online site.

Version 1.6 2012-10-08 3
 (Good interface, wish passbook would work) I always use Expedia and I am always happy with there service. However this app does not work with passbook, it gives me an error 503 when ever I try to add my reservation to passbook. Hope this gets fixed so I can take advantage of this cool feature.

Version 1.6 2012-10-06 1
 (Worthless - Deleted) This app is worthless. Upon entering a destination in the search window the app begins to fill in proposed areas of interest. But upon selecting any one the proposed list of destinations the app returns with message "No Hotels Found".  It will only show hotels correctly near your current location. Deleted it after multiple failed attempts.

Version 1.6 2012-10-06 5
 (Badran) Gr8 app gr8 prices

Version 1.5 2012-10-06 5
 (Good convenient) Easy, convenient, fast

Version 1.5 2012-10-05 2
 (Disappointed) It was ok before the update. Now I can't even get it to start. Also I already had a hotel reservation thru Expedia that I got on my computer but there's no way to see it on the app. Please add that feature! And make it work!

Version 1.5 2012-10-05 3
 (Expedia app) I needed to book two rooms at the same time but I had to do it separately. Also the pictures of each type of room can be wonderful so I will know what I'm buying. Other than these two things, it is great app.

Version 1.5 2012-10-05 5
 (Expedia app) This was easier than calling the hotel!  There were plenty of hotels from which to choose. Much better than trying to find a place to stay by reading billboards on the interstate

Version 1.5 2012-10-05 1
 (Hotel search doesn't work) No results found. That's all I get from this app. iOS 6 with iphone5

Version 1.5 2012-10-03 1
 (Doesn't work) I thought this would be a good app but I can't even get it to start! It freezes and won't work. Quite disappointing, I was honestly expecting more from Expedia 😣

Version 1.5 2012-10-02 5
 (Awesome app for the business man) I don't usually take time to write a review or rate an app even if I really like it but this app is amazing! Very quick and efficient, especially if you have an account set up with Expedia! I us this for work all the time! Great job guys!

 (Very user friendly) Very easy to use; helped me find a deal and place to book within minutes :)

Version 1.5 2012-09-27 5
 (Love this app!) It was so easy to use. I could find places anywhere and the toggle between the map and hotel info was easy. T didn't have to wait for any pages to load or go back etc. To make reservations I just logged in and my info was already there, easy to edit and book a room. Thanks Expedia !

Version 1.5 2012-09-26 5

Version 1.5 2012-09-14 5
 (Simple and cheap) I always use this app for booking hotels. They usually have the cheapest rates. The pics and reviews really help to know what kind of hotel you're getting. I also like "hotel tonight" app.

Version 1.5 2012-09-14 5
 (Simple cheaper and easy) Much cheaper than on a computer

 (Love the app.) Very functional app.  Works perfectly.   A street view option on the maps would be nice. Or a way to open the hotel's location on Google Maps.

Version 1.5 2012-09-05 5
 (Love this app) Great mobile savings

Version 1.5 2012-09-04 4
 (Review Itineraries ?) Very handy app. I did not find a way to review an existing itinerary, though, without logging into the Expedia site separately.

Version 1.5 2012-09-04 5
 (Expedia App) Made it very simple to find and book a room... GREAT APP!

Version 1.5 2012-09-04 5
 (Unbelievable!) I downloaded the app yesterday and tried it for an upcoming concert. Unfortunately, I did not double check the dates and went along through my day thrilled with the ease of use and availability of the hotel I had chosen. Last night, I received my calendar reminder about my reservation for that day (not Friday as I had planned). I panicked, but easily located the customer service number for Expedia and spoke to Jackie, who was completely wonderful. She called the hotel and cancelled the reservation and convinced them not to charge the standard fee for my mistake.  She was so helpful and even suggested I call the hotel directly to attempt to negotiate a similar rate for the night I had actually planned to be there.  Given the amazing customer service I received, coupled with the amazingly easy to navigate app,  I will be booking on Expedia from now on!  In this computerized age, there is no substitute for companies that still practice exceptional customer service. Bravo Expedia!

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-23 4
 (Used while traveling Europe) For all intents and purposes this app worked well for me while traveling Europe. The only plans I had were the countries I would visit beyond that I had no reservations. I used this app to book my travel while on the go and it worked great. The customer reviews were helpful, and so was the amenities breakdown, e.g., Wifi in room, breakfast included, and if these had surcharges. I would book up to 20 minutes before entering hotel(s) and never had a problem. However, upon walking in I did find that a few of hotels had cheaper rates than what I booked, but if you wait until you walk in your not guaranteed a room so...

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-22 5
 (Wish it did air and cars too) Well done app. Intuitive and easy to use, quick, nicely presented. Worth the download if you're a regular Expedia visitor.

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-21 5
 (Get this) Absolutely amazing!!!

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-21 5
 (Works Great) Love it, works very well.  Very easy to use to find nearby hotels.  One thing I'd like to see is ability to drag point of interest around to show hotels nearest that point.  Otherwise currently you can look up a point of interest, address, etc

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-21 5
 (Awesome) Very Useful

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-20 5
 (Consumer) I use this app ANYTIME I even start thinking about traveling to help budget. It's quick and easy to use and provides plenty of information from reviews, amenities, nearby locations and real reviews from people who visited the places.. Awesome APP

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-20 5
 (Better than the website!) This app is lightning fast and gorgeously designed. Fast way to filter and drill down in your searches. Great way reviews and photos are displayed. Map integration and purchase confirmation screens are great. Love the "add to calendar" and "view property in maps app" after purchase.

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-20 5

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-14 5
 (Easy!) Easier to book a room on this app than from pc at home.

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-11 4
 (Nice for booking...not for viewing itineraries) This app is awesome for booking a room. Easy to use, choose dates, locations, number of guests, etc. Has lots of information about each hotel. Highlights deals for you. You can even read the reviews from other guests through the app. 

One area where this app is sorely lacking is the fact that you can't view your itineraries for future trips. It seems to me that this would be an obvious thing to be able to do from the Expedia app!  Huge oversight!!!

Other than that it is a great app if you are just booking a room.

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-11 5
 (Awesome app) Staying at one hotel here in NY... Not too happy so went to this awesome appt and within minutes I'm book in another. Love it!!!!!!

 (Works when it matters) Reached Chicago, had forgot to book a hotel. Search by location - hotels show up - simple credit info form. Bam! Hotel booked. Clean interface is a big plus. Thumbs up to the mobile team at Expedia.

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-05 4
 (Great App) This app showed me a hotel that was not on the other apps. It was a luxury hotel with a Christmas time special. Got a great deal and saved money

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-04 1
 (Easy but more expensive) All the others review rates high on the level of the app development and easy usage.  I am on the road often and in EVERY CASE the rates were AT LEAST 15 present higher.  I am guessing tat is the commission Expedia profits. If you don't care about your rate and a lazy planner rather than calling the establishments and talking to someone ten this apps for you!

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-04 3
 (Good app) I like it

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-03 5

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-27 5

 (Very easy to use) I like how this presents the hotel choices and I like how it shows a breakdown of your final cost before you book the room.

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-23 4
 (Nice app!) Very nice app and user friendly.  I like the fact that I can modify search criteria without having to re-enter other data over again.  I would like to be able to edit payments within the app or add and save another card.  I made multiple reservations and was required to re-enter my new info each time.  Fix this and I would give app another star.

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-23 5

 (Great for on the fly (or on the drive into manhattan)) I gotta tell you, for an impromptu trip into New York city, I couldn't have done it without this app! Just go by "popular" selection and it should steer you in the right direction.

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-15 5
 (Excellent) Has done well by me worldwide

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-14 5
 (Great App) This app is great for booking a room on the go.  I've used it many times now!

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-13 5
 (Excellent for hotel on the go) This app is perfect for my use: trying to find last minutes hotels when I am on the road. It allows you to open a map and search for all hotels on the map screen. It puts them on the map with the pins and you can select pins to see prices. You can also view in a sortable list format.

Very easy to book and review hotels.

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-13 5

 (good app) love this app

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-05 4
 (Web site is much better) I love Expedia!!!  I have booked over US$50,000 in travel through the web site.

The App is OK, but lacks the review details by "Room Cleanliness", "Service", etc. that I have come to expect.

I found myself checking out the hotels in the website and then booking through the App because that part really is better in the App.

I know they will make it better, I just hope that they do it soon, as I find myself checking Kayak more everyday to search for Air tickets, cars, and hotels.  They should be able to do something like Kayak has done, which is really great...

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-04 1
 (Bad) Price always higher than booking ,, you can check ... There is no customer service in the APP

Version 1.4.1 2012-06-30 3
 (Cave man xpedia) So we're in the 21st century and this app feels like it was made in the 19th century by a 5 year old. Literally, im into os development myself so I really appreciate good work but this seriously one of the WORST APPS of all time. I say this because Xpedia is a BIG COMPANY how do they come up with this Lolololol? Just use grupon, way better. 
Reason why I'm complaining is that there are virtually no good filtering options, no categories, and getaways within a certain range of your location are limited to 10 miles!!!! Oh and once you find a location that you like YOU CANNOT DIRECTLY ACCESS GOOGLE MAPS THROUGH THIS APP! If that wasnt bad enough, you can't even copy the address location so that you can leave the app and find how to get to your destination. 

Pros (the few): 
Large variety of hotels 
Xpedia does have one cool thing that you use the map to literally find a hotel in the area that you can see.

Version 1.4 2012-06-29 4
 (Works Great) Simple fast process.  
Room was $109.00 reg.  paid $85.00

 (Major app booking error!!!) I was in Punta Cana Dominican Republic on a Wednesday. I booked a hotel in South Beach. For the weekend starting on friday, instead the app booked me for that same night. I'm still in Punta Cana  and Expedia nor Loews in south beach would change nor cancel the reservation and I had to pay for the 300.00 night not the special. Expedia cancel my account, this was the second time i have had a problem with them  I will never use them or their app again !!  Oh and I stopped payment.

Version 1.4 2012-06-28 4

 (Fasting Booking!!!) This app was very helpful and easy for me, I booked a flight and hotel with any inconvenience I recommend it.

Version 1.0.2 2012-06-23 1
 (Bad customer service) Used this app to book a room at the Luxor in Vegas.  Was charged an extra $20 'resort fee' when I checked in. When I called Expedia I was told that they had used hotels.com to book the room and that I would need to call them to resolve the problem... Huh?? This app is being deleted. From now on I will call the hotel directly.

Version 1.4 2012-06-22 5
 (Clean, simple, easy app) Very easy to search and book a room.

Version 1.4 2012-06-21 1

Version 1.4 2012-06-06 5
 (Awesome) Found hotel fast, booking was simple. Great app

Version 1.4 2012-06-05 1
 (Horrible) This app is horrible. When picking a date for a trip, it set it back to the day of, meaning instead of getting the date for the weekend it gave the time of purchase. Plus the conformation was never sent. Leave it to Expedia to find a loop hole not to refund this error.

Version 1.4 2012-06-04 5
 (Fantastic!!!! Easy to use, works great) Needed to book a hotel. Started on the web site from my iPad browser and decided to stop and check if they had an App for that. Sure enough, they did!!! It was so much easier to use than the web site on the iPad.  Booked my hotel faster than ever before...

Version 1.4 2012-06-04 5

 (Easy Booking!) Love Expedia and almost always use it when booking for plane/hotel! This app is user friendly and made booking our hotel a synch! By logging into my Expedia account, booking was one-click away! Would def recommend.

Version 1.4 2012-06-02 5
 (Easy and efficient) I love this app! It's so easy to use. Yu can search by address, are etc. any way you can on the computer. Once you hit "book" you're booked, no re entering all your info. Quick and easy-just what I like in an app.

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-31 5
 (Expedia) Love this app makes traveling a lot easier

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-30 5
 (Great app!) Has made my travels and room searches an ease.

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-30 1
 (Dishonest Agents) Dishonest Expedia agents will push what they tell you is "the last deal available" on what you're looking for, when that is not actually the case. The last one I spoke with was incredibly pushy and outright rude. I don't plan to give Expedia my business any longer. There are too many other companies in this business that don't treat their customers this way.

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-30 5
 (VERY USER FRIENDLY!!!) Easy to maneuver through the site. Was able to hit the "back" button without starting all over. WILL USE APP AGAIN!!!! :)

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-30 1
 (Poor interface) Very confusing interface.  No obvious way to sign in to an existing expedia account.

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-28 4

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-21 5
 (Easy, fast....) I was using this app along with looking actually online to Expedia.com, and the app found a better price?!? I recommend it when you gotta book fast.

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-19 4
 (Great last minute deal) Love the map option to search and compare.

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-18 5

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-16 5
 (Woohoo!) We are in a road trip right now and this made booking rooms on the go super easy!  Looks great, easy to use, lots of information on each hotel. I wish I could use it more often!

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-16 5
 (First time use) So far so good. Hotels website said no vacancy, Expedia said vacancy, room booked.

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-16 5
 (Amazing app for travel) I am an Expedia users for years and this application made it even easier! You can auto fill your info from your Address Book (you should have yourself as a contact) and the booking process is fast and easy. Also, I find hotels and deals that I didn't find in other major travel apps.

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-14 1
 (Expedia rewards users stay away from This app!) This is a great app for booking hotels but for expedia rewards users is The worst because before you buy it reminds you to use The same email used in The rewards program so you can earn points, but those points never appear in your account because for The app you are only a guest. Its not so hard to integrate The app with a expedia account and it is not that hard to take out these kind of misleading notes!

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-14 1
 (Terrible App) Had to give at least one star to leave the rating, but really needs a negative star option!!! I read their "policy" about they understand sometimes things change and that if need be you are allowed to cancel your reservations up to two days in advance. Really? What a load of crap!! Tell me why then did you draw the $$ out of my account within days of the reservation being made?? 
Don't waste your time or money!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-14 1
 (Bait and Switch) Be ever so careful when making reservations for anything. They tend to shy away from full disclosure of information. It's still best to actually talk to a live rep so you can dig all the facts out before dedicating to making reservations. If you don't you might get a bad $$$$$ surprise. Having to personally confirm with a rep makes the app pretty useless.

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-11 5
 (Buena aplicacion me resuelve muchos viajes) La recomiendo

Version 1.3.2 2012-05-09 5
 (Great tool) Expedia has been the best travel partner for our family. After working with so many airlines and hotels we have chosen to do all our travel plans with Expedia and this app is just another reason!!! Great job

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-15 5
 (Living this) Living this app! Literally couldn't book on laptop due to slow speeds....so I booked a whole vacation from phone! Flight, car rental and hotel, all through this app. Got email notifications right away as well.

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-14 3
 (Cool app) I wish I could see my reservations in the app for all my trips.

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-14 1
 (Beware:EXPEDIA SCAM TRAVELERS) They couldn't cancel my hotel reservation even i was cancelling it few hours when i booked it on the same day..i went to the hotel and asked them to cancel my reservation but they just adviced me to call EXPEDIA for cancellation..and EXPEDIA said we can cancel the hotel reservation but you cannot get your money back:( sad but true..i was a victim of a one of the GREAT SCAMMERS in the world EXPEDIA..:(

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-13 5
 (Great app) Easy to use and makes it quick

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-13 5
 (Very convenient. Awesome) Great app for the movers and shakers

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-12 5
 (Nice) Very nice app to find a place to spend the night quick and easy while the wife was driving

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-12 2
 (Warning for guest users) Decent app except if you use the guest account to make a reservation but have an Expedia account.  You can't see your hotel information nor link the reservation to your account after the fact.  Not even if you call customer service.  That needs to fixed or at least some kind of warning given.

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-12 1
 (A dump!) Went into my room and the toilet was clogged. Asked the front desk manager for a plunger, to which he told me to call back in ten minutes, to which he would be gone for the evening when I did call back in ten minutes. The toilet paper holder kept falling off.
 The remote control to the TV did not work and the bed just had this icky feeling about. I didn't even bother getting under the covers.

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-12 5
 (Dig it) Easy, breezy for making reservations on the go. Intuitive as well. Ty

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-11 5

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-09 4
 (Easy & Effective) I travel often on short notice. This is such a useful tool to quickly find somewhere to stay.

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-07 3

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-06 5
 (Great app - map feature is awesome) This is a great app. The map function allows for easy area search

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-05 5
 (Easy!) Booked a vacation in less than 1 minute!

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-05 1
 (Always Books As Guest) Wish this app cataloged more info about hotels such as breakfast, pool, and wifi.  Hope they update the app soon so I can book travel using my online Expedia account. Until then it is better to use the web interface or the kayak app so I don't have to enter the same info every time.

Version 1.3 2012-04-03 5
 (Was actually really great) No problems. Easier than the website. 
If I had a comment it would be to add a feature to bookmark hotels as you're making your decisions and sorting out your plans

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-02 4
 (The Friday night experience) Good app never have issues with Expedia. I wish they would tell you if the hotel rooms have other things like a jacuzzi. Or a feature that can tell you how close the hotel is to wherever you're going. But overall very useful and they were cheaper than hotels.com

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-02 5
 (Excellent app!!!) Simple but very useful. Never had booking experience so easy!!!

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-02 5
 (Hotel) Best app ever love it

Version 1.3 2012-04-01 1
 (Fake app Beware) This app needs to be removed because it fundamentally misrepresents the services being provided.  
It may NOT book you through Expedia even though you sign in to your Expedia account, and receive a confirmation email from Expedia. 
The app may actually book you through Hotels.com-and you will receive no credit from Expedia. 
Expedia representatives will tell you that "app" bookings are handled by another department.  However, there is no other department- only the 1800 780 5733 number which is Hotels.com.
Fake.

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-01 5
 (Excellent app!!) Booked my whole 1 1/2 month through south east Asia with this app :)

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-01 5
 (slick, easy to use, great prices) Very very easy to use, and great prices.

Version 1.3.1 2012-04-01 5
 (Very good app) Excellent

Version 1.3.1 2012-03-31 5
 (Butchie) I never travel. Expedia made me feel like a pro. I found prices better than expected. Flight and Hotel. Most important, I Can Trust Expedia! Sounds like I work for there marketing department. Lol! I don't. I'm just a garbage man in WA. Thanks Expedia for making my travel plans stress free.

Version 1.3.1 2012-03-31 5
 (Easy process) Did it with one thumb. So cool!!!!

Version 1.3.1 2012-03-31 5
 (Great) Booked perfectly

Version 1.3 2012-03-25 3
 (Almost good) Would have gotten 4 stars if I didn't have to create a new email address just to book a room because it didn't like the address from my personal domain.

Version 1.3 2012-03-25 5
 (Awesome app!) Strongly recommended

Version 1.3 2012-03-24 1
 (Very poor app) I am a heavy Expedia user for business travel. This app is useless. 
1.  Cannot log in to your account 
2.  Cannot find hotels out of the country
3.  Cannot book airlines
4.  If you do book, cannot use your frequent flier / hotel loyalty account
5.  Cannot enter corporate discount codes or AAA discount

It is hard to imagine his this app was specified or why even of was produced.

Version 1.3 2012-03-24 3
 (Crashes a lot) The app crashes every time I try to view a photo of a room. Very annoying. Please fix it.

Version 1.3 2012-03-23 5
 (Easy to use) Easy to use with lots of info, like how they show which hotels have deals by the color of the pin

Version 1.3 2012-03-23 1
 (Not integrated and simple to make mistake) This does not allow you to sign in with your Expedia profile and it is very easy to make an expensive irreversible mistake while book, poorly designed app

Version 1.3 2012-03-23 4
 (Good App!) Fast and easy to book hotel. Only drawback is couldn't enter AAA code.

Version 1.3 2012-03-23 5
 (Amazing App) Easy to use, very intuitive, flawless!!!

Version 1.3 2012-03-22 5
 (Nice) Great fast and easy to use

Version 1.3 2012-03-21 5
 (Great app!) That was so easy to use!

Version 1.3 2012-03-20 1
 (Disappointed) This has most of the basic features you would generally take for granted in a hotel app, but the inability to select the basic room options, like king or double beds, specify non smoking or hypoallergenic requirements or even request additional options like a roll away or request a high or low floor means you might as well just call the hotel where they will ask you these things as standard policy. It's funny that basic features like these were omitted. Beware.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-20 3
 (So so) I love using this app and get great prices but I reserved 2 rooms 2 nights and for some reason the hotels got 1 reservation other then that great app

Version 1.3 2012-03-20 1
 (Be Aware of the Hidden Service Fees!) Watch out for hidden fees!
Got charged almost $20 for services I don't need! They don't specify this in the page!

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-20 5
 (awesome app) Worked perfectly!

Version 1.3 2012-03-18 5
 (Phenomenal app) I rarely write reviews, but this app was so well thought out I had to mention it. It has great design, extremely fast response and even filled out my booking info from my address app. Wonderful app. Other developers can really learn something from this!

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-15 5
 (Awesome) Thank you what a life saver

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-14 5

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-14 5
 (EXPEDIA) Very helpful and useful app!

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-13 4
 (review) really fast

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-13 2
 (Meh) Good hotel app, but I use expedia to bundle that w/ a car and flight typically, which the app doesn't support. I'll use it if I'm lost somewhere and find a wifi connection to get the nearest hotel, but that's it.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-13 3
 (Easy does it) My last trip has still not been updated to my Expedia account and for some reason my reward points seem to have disappeared. I'm beginning to loose faith.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-12 5
 (Greatest ever!!!) As long as you understand the fact that you get what you pay for, this will be the best in its market....

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-11 5
 (Awesome) Totally awesome

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-11 2
 (Just okay) Compared to the regular website this app is lacking. It will not let you search by address or venue. And when it gives distances it is from city center which in a large city is useless.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-11 1
 (FRUSTRATING!!!!!!) I would love this app, except every time I book a hotel, the hotel claims to never have received the reservation and then I end up spending an hour calling the hotel and Expedia/Hotels.com. Ridiculous.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-10 2
 (😡😔) I really did like this app in the beginning but now every time I try using it it'll start and then kick me out another thing I don't like for myself personally is that it doesn't ask for a smoking or non smoking like the website if these were fixed I'd give it a five but since this glitch has been an issue for a bit of time had to give it a 2

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-08 4
 (Very easy to use) Very nicely done. Quick and simple.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-08 4
 (Wow) Very impressed with this app by Expedia. It's fast, easy to use, and very intuitive. Didn't get a perfect ratings because I couldn't sign in to my Expedia account.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-07 5
 (Firehouse6) It was quick and easy. Just what i needed.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-06 5
 (Love It!) I've used Expedia for years. The app makes it even easier. Awesome job.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-06 5
 (Great app) Used it several times to book a hotel. Easy to use, good deals.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-05 4
 (Works great!) I used this app for the first time today and everything went smoothly.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-04 5
 (Made it so easy!) Great, easy booking. Love this app!

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-03 1
 (Horrible Experience) I usually love Expedia, but this app is awful. 3 times it told me there were problems with my request. I gave up and booked through my comp. Then, 6 hours later, after it's too late to cancel normally, I get 3 email confirmations that my room was booked 3 times. I call Expedia, but after a long time on the phone she tells me these are hotel.com reservations. I tell her that I didn't use hotel.com's ap, I used Expedia's, so they should fix this. Her supervisor had to hear the whole story and he transferred me to another department who had to hear the whole story and tell me she can't help. Call hotels.com. they did help, but it took over another half hours. 90 minutes to cancel reservations I was told were not made successfully by this app, but which actually were, just not via Expedia, and which Expedia help desk can't help on. Why is the app called Expedia?

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-03 1
 (Crash Problems) Have been using this on my iPhone3G for 2 years with great success. But yesterday while booking on my 4S, the app crashed after logging in my credit card. I never got a confirmation # from Expedia, so after deleting, synch & reinstall, could find no record of my reservation going thru. I redid the entire reservation & got a conf email. After we got to the hotel, we found that we had paid for 2 rooms w no refund options. Fortunately, a phone call to Expedia Cancelled the first reservation. Hopefully my credit card will be refunded. The app has since crashed again... So only 1 star for the app for crashing and almost costing me hundreds of $$$ and signif time and phone calls.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-02 4
 (Liked it) Really simple and convenient to search a book a room. New to add functionally to add more than one night.

Version 1.2.2 2012-03-02 5
 (On our way!!) Literally on the road 2 hrs from our destination and booked with this app in a matter of minutes, thanks!!

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-29 5
 (Hotels, Inns, and Motels; oh my!) After downloading several of the hotel apps and running them side by side my conclusion was this was the easiest to navigate and had the lowest average prices of apps. Credit card information was easy, form auto filled from my personal info on the iPad and just like that my wife and I were booked for 4 nights at the best priced inn/hotel. 

One of the other apps wanted me to sign in or sign up for membership...right one more membership in my life.

Thanks for making this easy to locate, price, and book.

 (Great App) Never fails

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-24 1
 (Horrible) Almost impossible to use. What were these idiot designers thinking? Total junk. Shove it up your arse Expedia

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-23 1
 (Booked a room now I can't use app!) This is my first time to book using this app and now that my account has been charged the app won't open and keeps shutting down.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-20 1
 (Amazing apps) Easy to use, attractive but you can't find you itinerary in your account when you book via this app!!!

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-20 1
 (Not what it says it is!) Be very careful - this app is not what it says it is.  I booked a room, got my confirmation email from Expedia but when I tried to change my itinerary it was nowhere to be found at Expedia.  After phoning customer service I was told it was actually a Hotels.com booking . . . news to me!  Not in the reservation info itself, not in the email, no link to hotels.com.   Ridiculous, useless application.  I'm deleting it immediately.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-19 1
 (Terrible Experience) My reservation confirmation did not get to the hotel. I called customer service several times before receiving help was disconnected FOUR times before I got an agent. Finally got through and was told that i had to call hotel.com customer service. Never again will I use Expedia or hotels.com and I will tell everyone I know!

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-19 5
 (App) Great useful easy smart fun fast and clean app.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-18 5
 (Awesome App) Awesome app when you need to book a hotel while you are not in front of a computer!

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-17 4
 (Travel made easy!) I love this app!  Probably one of the best apps out today. Makes travel so easy!

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-16 1
 (Great app bad customer service) I have booked many rooms and flights thru expedia and when I go to receive my rewards for my trips I have a big fat Goose egg on my account.  Then I try and log into my account to see my itinerary and there is nothing there.  Called customer service and they tell me I don't get any rewards because the app is partnered with hotels.com...Please explain to me why is it partnered with hotels.com and everything I receive from expedia about my reservations do not have anything to do with hotels.com and when the guy asked for the customer service number I received at first he said it was for expedia and when I told him thats the same number I received he told me that was for hotels.com...??? really?!?!?! Way to change it up there buddy.  I gave him my confirmation number and Itinerary number and he still could not find anything on my account about my trips...Like I stated before...great and convient app but horrible when it comes to customer service.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-16 1
 (Rmartin) Entered a wrong digit for my security code.  The app would not recognize corrected information after entering security code. Had to use another card to complete booking.

Version 1.2.1 2012-02-15 5
 (Great when on the road!) Used this on our last trip and it was a life saver. 1am looking for a hotel ahead on I95 and it shows pics, amenities, and pricing.  What more can you ask for!

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-14 2
 (Not so good) Now that I've booked once, the darn thing crashes every time I try to open it.

Can't look up my itinerary online even with the provided itinerary number and email. 

Wish it would have let me look at an overview before booking. Now I will probably have to cancel and rebook because it wouldn't let me enter special preferences and I can't access my itinerary without calling Expedia.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-14 3
 (Itinerary Issue) The itinerary does not register on the website even if the email is the same or if you manually use the confirmation number and email.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-14 5
 (Expedia) La compra fue facil y amigable, buen servicio, buenos precios

 (Screw you) This app is a worthless piece of junk

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-08 5
 (Awesome!) Freaking awesome! Saw an ad on drudge report and downloaded it right from there. Just booked my stay for next weekend in 5 minutes. Great app.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-07 1
 (Bleh!) This app is slower than a special needs kid raised by Paris Hilton and Kid Rock.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-06 1
 (Great, but missing key features) The user interface for this app is beautiful.   There is a usability issue in that the "search bar" at the top is actually a location search, but the means of filtering hotels (including by name) is handled by a button at the bottom.  More than once I had done a search and mistakenly typed a hotel name into the location search bar to filter the location which then tried to change my location.  I think it would be more intuitive to make location, sort, and filter ALL be buttons at the bottom so as to avoid this.  Clearly filter can't be handled with a search bar since there are more filters available than hotel name, but location changing hardly requires quick access either since folks tend to book one trip at a time.  

The biggest problem with this app is that it is separate for the Expedia Trip Assist app.  You cannot use your Expedia Account to login and have the reservation tracked on your account under itineraries.  This also means you cannot cancel or change your reservations through the app.  I had to call an 800 number to make a cancellation.  And the only official confirmation you get is by email.  If that email gets lost you have to call Expedia and try to track it down by name and phone number and see if they can help you. 

Anyway, this app is beautiful but looks like it needs a few revisions or merging with other apps before replacing the Expedia website.  This is sad because the native app experience should be better than the web app experience.  Looking forward to updates.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-05 5
 (Great APP) I use Expedia all the time and this helps me book something while on the go. International selection and pricing is also fantastic.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-04 5
 (Best) Da best

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-02 5
 (Best use of an iPad) I just used this app to make my hotel reservation and it worked much better than expected. No glitches, no problems and the layout is very well thought out.  The tools inside allow you to narrow your choices by stars, area, etc. as well as on a map.  After making the reservation I was able to send the confirmation to a second email address.  With an option button in the App, it was entered in my calendar. Wow. Thanks Expedia.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-02 5
 (Awesome app) This is the easiest app to make hotel reservations. It took less than 5 min. from the time I launched the app until I received my confirmation for the booking.

Version 1.2.2 2012-02-01 2
 (No pet sorter) I would like this app if I could sort out hotels that allow pets.

Version 1.2.2 2012-01-31 4
 (Great travel app) I have had this app for a while and never used it. I finally got around to using it to book a hotel stay. 
Easy to use, no glitches. Great product. Thanks

Version 1.2.2 2012-01-28 5
 (Helpful) Intuitive

Version 1.2.2 2012-01-28 5
 (Expedia) Awesome easy to use and Expedia even help me make a change with no problem. I always use Expedia and always will.

Version 1.2.2 2012-01-28 1
 (BEWARE, this app is misleading!) Do not use this app if you are an Expedia customer wishing to earn rewards, or have your itineraries show up in your Expedia account. 

This app outsources to Hotels.com. You cannot view your trip from within your Expedia account or Expedia's TripAssist app. 

I booked 5 different hotels with this app last week assuming I was booking through Expedia, only to find that I could not access my itineraries in one place. 

This app is Misleading! Why does it not say the reservations are handled by Hotels.com? 

The Expedia phone support told me to call Hotels.com and cancel all 5 reservations then rebook with Expedia if I wanted the rewards and centralized itinerary information. I THOUGHT I HAD BOOKED WITH EXPEDIA.  

Bad Mojo.

Version 1.2.2 2012-01-27 5
 (Expedia iphone app!) As usual easy to use and never fails!

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-25 5
 (Super Easy!) Typed in where I wanted the hotel to be close to and BOOM, done. Easy and simple. Zac Brown Band here we come!!

Version 1.2.2 2012-01-25 5
 (Easy App) Has easy as using the iTunes....took less than 3 minutes from start to finish

Version 1.2.2 2012-01-23 1
 (One MAJOR Flaw at the moment...) Loved the app however there was a bit of a snafu when I tried to make a reservation.  I was able to get all the way to the end but after putting in your info and credit card info, you click "submit" and the app crashes.  Please fix this otherwise the app is next to useless save for checking on prices.  Thanks!!!

Version 1.2.2 2012-01-22 5
 (Straight Forward Booking Info) I like creating my bookings on this site. The info presentation is easy and straightforward.

Version 1.2.2 2012-01-21 1
 (Stopped working) This app was great, but now it can't connect to Expedia. It seems something went wrong with the upgrade.

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-20 1
 (Double-charged me, and now app crashes on start - DO NOT USE!) I downloaded this yesterday to make a fast booking while I was traveling.  There was no option to log in with my Expedia account, so I had to fill in my address and credit card number.  The next time I started the app, it crashed after two seconds; but I did see a confirmation in my email, so I thought things were okay.

Today I arrived at the hotel and they told me that I have TWO reservations.  I checked my bank's app, and sure enough -- two debit card charges.  I had to bring up Expedia's site to find a customer service number (because this app always crashes now!) and they had to transfer me to the other company that manages this app. I stayed on hold for fifteen minutes before reaching a much less friendly rep, who asked me to hold for "four or five more minutes" while she confirmed with the hotel that I was only using one reservation.  I was then hung up on.  I haven't confirmed yet whether the second charge was reversed.

It's one thing for an app to crash on start.  It's another for it to cost me money and then give me no effective way to get resolution.  Technically and financially, this thing is a disaster.  I've had nothing but positive experiences with Expedia until now.  They shouldn't have put their name on this third-party failure.

 (Expedia will steal from you) Used this app one time and expedia stole money from me. Scammers they are. No customer service. Was hung up on and treated like a felon. Service rep manager even confirmed it was because of a known system error they are working on, but refused to help at all  they are crooks. DONT USE THIS APP OR EXPEDIA. Will never look at them again after this. Deleting app. Hope more people will think twice before throwing money away by using this app. Do yourself a favor call hotel directly. Only getting one star because i have to select something. They wanted my family to walk home 300 miles because of this known system error. Never again expedia, after reading some on internet im not alone in these complaints. Run away from this app and expedia. Not sure how they are still in business

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-16 5
 (Great App!!) This app allows me to book hotels room any where any time.

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-15 5
 (Easy as 123) From the point of installing this app to receiving confirmation of my bookings it only took me 5 minutes and I got a 10% discount. Awesome! So easy and clear to navigate through.

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-15 1
 (Misleading app) First of all they double booked me.
Second it books thru hotel.com which it doesn't  disclose.  I called Expedia and they said no reservation found you have to call hotel.com, they transferred me to another country and the problem was not corrected or found.  Very bad service.  Long wait and no help.  So I am calling my cc company to refute the charges.  use a computer @ Expedia.com instead.  On top of that no cancelation or refund for the extra room the booked.

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-15 1
 (Double booked!!!) This app is no good and customer service does not help at all!! Took me a half say to get my money back!

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-14 1
 (Crashing) App keeps crashing whenever  I lookup for a hotel in London, UK

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-13 5
 (Para los viajes) Excelente app!!

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-13 1
 (Disappointed) I was really exicted about this app, since I book frequently through Expedia. Used it for the first time this week and it double-booked me. I find the app very limited in that as far as I can tell, you can't book a complete package, only fliight, then hotel, then a car, which is a pain! Additionally, you can't sign-in to your Expedia account from this app, so anything booked doesn't show up on your iteneraries (and therefore doesn't get applied to your point accumulation). Overall I have been very disappointed and have deleted the app.

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-13 1
 (Unelegant user experience) Sure, it's simple enough, but be very wary:
If you fat-finger it, you could mess up up your dates.
Which means you could go to a hotel. And have the wrong reservation dates. 
Which then means you have to call Expedia. Only they don't hold the actual reservation, per se; it's through hotels.com. 
So you wait.
And wait.
And wait.
Eventually, it gets fixed. But not after you spend half an hour on the phone. Trying to get it all worked out To make it even more awesome, try doing it it in a foreign country.
Beyond the touchscreen, it is a very inelegant UX. shame on you Expedia.

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-13 5

 (Double booked!) Tried to reserve a room and a prompt showed up saying that the room was already booked so I booked another room which was successful. Only to find out that I had now reserved 2 rooms. Now Expedia will not give me a refund due to user error!!!!!

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-09 5
 (Makes my life easier!) I have used this app over and over and it has never failed me. I just made a reservation at a boutique hotel - and the app's price was 20% off the hotel's Internet rate. It seriously rocks.

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-09 5
 (The great traveling app) Fantastic! Absolutely love the ease of using this app and the abilities it has. Have only used it a few times, but has really helped in booking hotels last minute on the go as I love to travel spontaneously.

 (Great App) Great interface, information, and everything else! This app has everything you need to plan a vacation.

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-08 1
 (Malfunctioning App) One star is way to high! This is the third reservation I've tried through this app and EVERY TIME it has double booked and double charged me. While Expedia is quick to take my money, they are not so quick to return it. Instead of simply voiding the transaction, they have been processing as a return. USERS BEWARE!

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-02 4
 (Could be better) Great potential if they would add combined hotel and flight, as well as a longer calendar of dates.
Also, It crashes every time!!
-Overall.. For being free.. Not terrible. But not good either.

Version 1.2.1 2012-01-01 3
 (Good but need to fix bug.) This app is good and very convenient to book hotel. However, sometimes the app books the hotel room twice. Then u have to call the customer service. They told me they will give me a refund only if the hotel gives refund to them. I got my refund but I wonder what if... Funny thing is I did not even know the room was booked twice until the hotel told  me I had a reservation for 2 rooms.

 (Outstanding) Downloaded the app and made my first hotel booking inside of 3 minutes. Worked great!

Version 1.2.1 2011-12-25 1
 (Great app but got billed twice) The app is great except for the fact that I received two confirmation emails = two bookings for my reservation. Once I noticed this I spent 15 mins on the phone with Expedia who explained that hotels.com did the bookings and that they could not help me. The call transfer to hotels.com failed and hotels.com doesnt have a support line for calls from outside the USA... Anyway, bad first experience with this app.

 (crashes when pushing the Book Now button) How many stars should you get when your app is made for booking but crashes every time the Book Now button is pushed? I say ZERO but the don't have that here, so 1 is what you deserve!

Version 1.2.1 2011-12-24 4

 (Easy to use) Helpful

Version 1.2.1 2011-12-23 4
 (Easy and functonal.) Great app. I seamlessly searched and booked a hotel while visiting family.

 (Lousy when trying to find rooms at arbitrary location) I liked HotelPal (by Mobiata), and wrote them with a suggestion once which they responded to promptly. But they essentially directed me to this app. Today is first time I'm looking at it in preparation for traveling halfway across the country for the holidays, and wanted to locate a place to stay at various points in the trip. My problem with the app is that you cannot  drop a pin on the map in an arbitrary location and see properties around the pin. I can look at stuff near my Current Location, or search for  say…Cleveland,OH. But trying to look for rooms out on the interstate 50 miles away from Cleveland is, if not impossible, at least undocumented and not as simple as HotelPal. Why the pin-drop was apparently left out of this app (being essentially just a redesigned version under Expedia's brand) is a mystery to me. Sad too because I had emailed developer about including user reviews for properties in HotelPal, which do seem to be in this remake/rebrand,.

 (Hotel Booking App that can't book) I really want it rate 5 stars since I love the UI, but I've booked twice through this app and had problems both times. Once it wouldn't take my credit card (had to book directly through site instead), and the second time I was double booked (resulting in a 20 minute call to customer service). I see I'm not the only reviewer with this problem, so I'm hoping this will be addressed.

Version 1.2 2011-12-20 5

 (Super quick, super easy!) I have to admit, I'm a bit of an app snob. If something is not intuitive within 30sec of me opening it, whether realistic or not, I close it, and often just delete it. Clearly someone at Expedia did their app homework! I found this at 2:35a one morning on App Store, and it's 2:45a now. In that time, not only could I install it, figure out how to use it, find what I wanted, narrow it to the hotel I wanted, book it (at a great rate I might add), and I'm writing this review to you! All in less than 10mins. And frankly except for entering my credit card info (the app found my name and phone as I was typing it in my iPhone Contacts!), typing this review has taken far more time than finding and booking the hotel itself! 😃 One surprise is that it didn't auto fill my address as well, just name, email, and cell number. And it wouldn't switch to landscape (told you i am a snob!).  I'm sure they'll get those in the next release. Everything else was perfect. If you like Expedia, you'll like the app too!

Version 1.2 2011-12-09 1
 (Horrible customer service) I agree with previous reviewers - while the app is ok for searching for good deals, do your booking elsewhere as Expedia's customer service is as bad as off-shored customer service can get. It took me 10 phone calls with uninformed representatives, waiting on the line for a total of 2 hours, a few 'we will check and call you back' calls that were never followed up on, and over 2 months of waiting before I managed to get a refund for a flight that was cancelled by the airline..

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-08 1
 (No matter how good the app may be, DON'T use Expedia!) Expedia has the absolute WORST customer service I've ever experienced.  They *will* leave you hanging out to dry and if you ever manage to reach a real person on the phone, they will basically tell you "TOO BAD".

I cannot possibly stress how poor this company is at looking after it's customers.  Escalate your problem and they won't even call you back.  It's all foreign call-center nonsense and form-letter email replies.  If you're lucky enough to have your trip go smoothly with Expedia, consider yourself fortunate.  But if you run into any problems, believe me: you're #~(<%*!!!

And just like AOL in the nineties, they make it impossible to close your account online.  Go ahead.  Try it.  See what happens!

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-04 5
 (Great travel app) Gotta love an easy to use, straight forward app!!

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-04 1
 (Great app!!) Best app for hotels, is not compatible with Expedia rewards... Skip it until they fix it!

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-03 5
 (Apps are better) The works 100x better than the website

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-02 5
 (Buen buscador) Muy bueno lo recomiendo

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-02 5
 (Good app) Easy to search and book.

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-01 1
 (Terrible) This app is awful for Expedia account holders.  It does not make reservations through Expedia at all.  Rather it makes reservations through Hotels.com.  The user will not have access to the itinerary on their Expedia account and will not get rewards credit for the reservation.  The Expedia operators are completely confused about the app and cannot access the itinerary or provide any support.

Version 1.1.2 2011-12-01 5
 (Awesome) Works like a charm on my iPhone 4 with latest operating system.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-26 3
 (Great info but lots of crashes) I don't know why the Expedia app hates me so much. After selecting a hotel and entering my credit card details, the app crashes about 2/3 of the time when I try I submit my reservation. It's great for finding hotel info but VERY frustrating for booking.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-26 4
 (Good app) Easy to use, accurate. I wish there was a spot for "note for the hotel" or "email hotel with additional information" so I could be sure they know we have a pet. Otherwise, good app.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-25 5
 (Very Efficient) Awesome service!!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-25 5
 (Love it) Friggin awesome sweet deals. After trying to find a place to bring a lady of the night I decided to download this and book a room. Even though I only had the room for 40 mins was easy to book a room with this app!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-24 3
 (Excellent Deals!) Nice deals on my recent trip it's a great app on my new device!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-23 1
 (Can't pay!!!) When trying to book my reservation I keep getting error message, saying invalid security code on my credit card! I tried three different credit cards! What is this all about?  When calling Expedia they could not explain it nor give me the promotional price that's posted on the app! Not happy!!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-21 5
 (Excellent App) I've never reviewed an app but after using this Expedia app for a last minute booking of a hotel room I have to give this app five stars.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-20 1
 (What a B.S!!) Don't get this app, period.

Version 1.0.1 2011-11-20 5
 (Love it) Love it

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-20 5
 (Great hotel app) I love this app. It's easy to use, has so many ways of narrowing your search.  I just wish you could narrow by hotel name and that the app meshed with Trip Advisor

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-20 5
 (Great) Expedia is a great ap to plan vacations on the go so easy to do. Highly recommend this app!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-19 5
 (Awesome app very fast and easy!) Very very fast and easy :)

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-18 4
 (Nice App) Great deals must have application for all travellers!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-17 5
 (Go-to hotel app) This has been my go-to app for finding hotels while traveling through the USA. Great for last minute bookings.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-17 5
 (Incredible) This is the future!! I've used it a few times and every time I've gotten a cheaper deal than anywhere, including both web and actually at the hotel desk. Nothing is better than standing at the hotel desk and showing the price I'm paying to the desk clerk and they're like "how is it so cheap?" haha!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-16 5
 (Easy, current and thorough!) Easy to use, well designed and organized, photos and details of amenities, fees, etc. great to compare when deciding on hotels. Up to date availability.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-15 5
 (great app) great app

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-14 5
 (I hope they make this for the iPad) I love this application. I love the whole 3D experience you get when you first tap on it(very, very cleaver). It is accurate and lists all of the hotels next to me(much better than all of the other applications I've used). I love all of the photos of the hotels and more importantly the reviews others have given them so that I can minimize my chances of booking a bad hotel. 

i would love to see this on the iPad and would love to see the 3D animation carried over to the tripAssist program.

This is the best app for this …..

Version 1.1.1 2011-11-13 5
 (Love this app!) All the motel info I need to make quick comparisons of choices.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-11 5

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-10 5
 (So quick and easy!) Booked a hotel in mins!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-10 5
 (Cool app) Just booked a hotel near Disneyland. IPad app is pleasure to play with (can forget that the purpose is to book a room). Easy to read, check a property on a map, scroll to pictures and read reviews. Booking is easy and nicely arranged.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-10 5
 (Expedia trip assist) Perfect app,fast and easy. Booked multiply places and didn't have to re-enter customer info making it quick and easy.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-09 5
 (Love trip assist) Some apps seem like they will be helpful, but I only end up using them once or twice. I use trip assist all the time! Great App!!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-08 3

 (Perfect) Fast and easy, exactly what you are looking for!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-04 5
 (Awesome app) I use a ton of different apps to locate hotels as I travel all the time for work. This is the best and easiest I've come across yet!!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-03 5
 (Great app!) Booked several hotels on the fly when my laptop was not available! Awesome!!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-03 5
 (iPhone 4gs) Nice easy to use

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-02 2
 (Missing key components) Gray on gray text is very difficult to read, and you are only able to sort by class stars, not reviewer stars. That means you have to open one at a time to see which ones to avoid. I also noticed the lists are severely limited and are a fraction of what's online. Same with reviews; not all are visible on the app.

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-01 5
 (Easy to use!) Great app and real easy to use!

Version 1.1.2 2011-11-01 5

 (Gayleb) Just booked a room as we were driving down the interstate, what a way to go!

Version 1.1.2 2011-10-28 4
 (Easy to use) Very enjoyable experience using this app to research and ultimately book a hotel. And quick!

Version 1.1.2 2011-10-28 5
 (Map view & filters!) I much prefer Expedia's hotel app to Kayak's hotel search. The UI, map view, filtering, reviews, photos and prices are superb. 

The only feature that seems to be lacking is a way to "star" or favorite some hotels to easily compare a few places you might want to stay. Add this and you've got an unbeatable app!

Version 1.1.2 2011-10-25 4
 (Best for my trips) Looking for this kinda app, and i found it the appstore thank you

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-25 5

 (Awesome app!) I love this app!!!

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-19 5
 (Cool app) I just downloaded this app, booked a trip to san fran, and was confirmed on the spot. It then prompted me to add to my calender. It was all taken care of with a few clicks. Very cool!

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-16 5
 (Love this app!) Has the best prices and I love the pictures on the app of the hotel they look clear and beautiful! Great information of the hotels too!

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-15 5
 (Love It!) Expedia.com is great and I've used it for more than 15 years to book travel. This app bring that experience to your phone in a very convenient way. I actually prefer this app to the website. Bravo expedia!

Version 1.0.2 2011-10-13 5
 (Great App) Very easy to use and very accurate and detailed info.

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-13 2
 (Crashes in Map View) Crashes every time I look at the map. Deleted the app.

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-13 5
 (Travel time!!) Such a great app for quick booking

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-12 5
 (Nice app) Simple to use but would be nicer if filter had more options, like pool, Internet, etc.

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-08 5
 (Excellent & Easy to book and use!') 5 stars!

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-07 5
 (Awesome) Sooo quick n sooo easy! Luv it!!!

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-06 4
 (Better then booking online!) I've been using Expedia for ever... Booked airline tickets, rented cars, booked hotel rooms. This was the easiest thus far... Pulled my info from my phonebook and booked it!  Great app!

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-05 5
 (Great App!!!) I love this APP! I use it all the time! I never travel without it.

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-04 1
 (Needs a few more features) I love Expedia, and their Trip Assist app. This hotel finder needs some help though. I can't filter out hotels that are booked full on the nights I need them. Also, this would be the perfect app if I could get flights and rental cars, I normally never just book a hotel.
Update: I just realized that this is a third party app that's not part of Expedia. I need my reward points, so I'm deleting it now. I'll just use Expedia's website.

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-03 4
 (Not bad) It only took a few minutes.

Version 1.1.1 2011-10-02 4

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-28 5
 (Cool) Cool app

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-28 4
 (Nice) App had a lower price than the web site. Expedia also had the hotel $17 less than all other sites.  It was very quick, fast, and easy.  I would like to be able to sign into my expedia.com account when I use the app.  Otherwise, I really thank you for it.

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-28 5
 (Good app) Very handy

Version 1.1 2011-09-27 1
 (Didn't work for me) Booked hotel yesterday and got confirmation # and says charged to credit card. Hotel had no record. Even got confirmation email. Called expedia. State no record. Sure hope I don't get charged twice!!! Usuallly have no problems with expedia.

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-27 5
 (Great app!) I really like this app, it's fast and easy to book. The only bad thing is I read the review under me that said you can't get credit to your Expedia account, I've booked this way 3 times already. I wonder if the price is the same though. I just booked next Monday the newly opened Plaza in downtown LV where the entire property is completely redone and the deluxe room was $20. Going for our anniversary & really like downtown so we thought we would give this place a shot. The mayor we had here for 12 years is opening up an upscale steakhouse called Oscar's plus there is another to die for restaurant called Hash House A Go Go. So I figure it has to be a great place. Guess we will see soon!

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-26 1
 (DO NOT USE THIS APP IF YOU WANT REWARD POINTS!!!) I booked a room thru this app.apparently they outsource the booking to hotels.com.expedia told me they couldn't credit my rewards account for this trip since it was not booked thru expedia...??? customer service wouldn't help me, supervisor wouldn't even take my call.told me that i could cancel reservation and re-book thru expedia.thought i booked thru expedia the first time. will not use this app again....

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-25 4
 (Great user experience) Super simple to use with no annoying registration steps. The ability to select your address from your addressbook was slick and helpful.

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-23 4
 (Ferfect) Easy to use!  Awesome!

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-22 5
 (Booking is a breeze) I have found great rates and been able to make affordable short term plans.

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-19 5
 (Good app) Very easy to use and navigate, lots of useful pictures and info to help me find the right hotel. I used this app to find a dream hotel in Santa Cruz, and my partner said it was one of the best weekend getaway ever!

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-16 5
 (Viviana Santiago) This app is awesome

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-16 5
 (So easy to use!) Found hotel and info in 3 minutes.

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-14 5
 (Cheapest I've found) I've downloaded many apps and this one by far had the best pics, prices, and hotel search results than any other.

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-12 5
 (Very helpful) I loved the auto fill option, smart dudes. The info is highly reliable: I checked for hotels on Kayak, TripAdvisor and Google and none gave me useful info like this app, plus I got a deal that was (anonymously) posted on Priceline at a lower price, since there are no fees here.
Congrats

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-12 5
 (Awesome App!) Just booked my hotel with it for our Hawaii trip!

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-12 5
 (Why did I wait so long?.....) I always thought this app would be a waste of time as I have the other Expedia app also, how wrong could I have been, this app is really useful and gets straight to the point, you can easily compare prices of rooms, change dates easily. It's never crashed on me so this app gets all 5 stars, best of all it's free, well dine Expedia!

 (Expedia Expedia & Expedia) This is really the best application ever for hotel and flights reservation. 
I'm traveling to shanghai and I found incredible prices that I didn't find in any other websites...
It's really great....

Version 1.1 2011-09-08 1
 (False Ads) The app works fine...but to say it is affiliated with Expedia...must be a lie! I booked a hotel with them, I am a user of Expedia (the real thing), but you don't get reward points using this app.
If they are going to claim affiliation with Expedia, you should get your award points.
DO NOT USE THIS APP,

Version 1.1.1 2011-09-08 1
 (Crashinggggg) Same here tried to search and crashedddd everytime!!!!

Version 1.1 2011-09-07 1
 (App shuts down after data entry) I can enter search parameters and it will retrieve a listing/map of hotels, but once a hotel is selected the app shuts down and crashes every single time.

Version 1.1 2011-09-03 5

Version 1.1 2011-08-27 5
 (Great app) One of the best looking, most user-friendly, and functional apps out there. Very well done! May more follow Expedia's example.

Version 1.1 2011-08-27 5

Version 1.1 2011-08-22 2
 (Crashes a lot) For some reason the app crashes frequently. Tried it with my iPod and iPhone and it's the same. It needs some bug fixes soon!

Version 1.0.2 2011-08-21 5
 (Easy & convenient) We were @ a concert a couple hours from home & decided to stay overnight- other companies won't let u book after 11pm, but we were able to book our hotel after our concert & it was a great deal!

Version 1.1 2011-08-21 4
 (Expedia) Very easy to use.  :)

Version 1.0.2 2011-08-19 5
 (Really easy to use!) So easy and fast ... Found a booked a Nashville hotel in 5 minutes!

Version 1.1 2011-08-19 5
 (Easy to use) I really liked this app. It is easy to use and runs efficiently. Some room for improvement on integration with Tripit and with my current expedia account. I shared the confirmation via email to plans@tripit, but Tripit couldn't interpret the confirmation properly. However, forwarding the confirmation email received from Expedia afterwards worked as usual. Being able to copy my contact info from my Contacts is really good, but I would like to get that info from my Expedia account itself. At Expedia.com I already have credit card and frequent flyer numbers associated with my account.

Version 1.1 2011-08-19 5
 (Awesome) Awesome app!

Version 1.1 2011-08-19 5
 (Really good app) Saved my day in LA, got the app, got a room, less than five minutes. Easy to use. I looked at the hotel website for a room and none were available. This app got me the room, and a great price!

Version 1.1 2011-08-19 4
 (Great app!) 1 minute to make a reservation and pay!  That's exactly what apps are supposed to do.  Great time and money saver.

Version 1.1 2011-08-18 5
 (Nice and easy) Easy to use! Love it

Version 1.1 2011-08-18 5
 (User friendly) Easement of use, hotel app for dummies is more like it! Very prompt and quick transactions with confirmation email, very secure as well!

Version 1.1 2011-08-17 5
 (Superb!) Very user-friendly, quick and easy to use! If only all apps were like this! Nicely done.

Version 1.1 2011-08-16 5
 (Autofills your info!!!) Made a reservation in minutes and it autofilled my info with the autofill button!

Version 1.1 2011-08-16 5
 () So far so good. Simple & fast.

Version 1.0 2011-08-15 5
 (Excellent app!!) Works great, easy to use, and fast.

Version 1.1 2011-08-14 5
 (Works like a charm) I was able to find and reserve a hotel room in minutes. Effortless!

Version 1.1 2011-08-12 5
 (Best App - better than the website.) I was using the expedia website to try and book a room last minute that was fairly priced, conveniently located, and highly rated. unfortunately, after 35 mins of browsing, I downloaded the app. To my surprise, I was able to book my room within 10 mins and find exactly what I was looking for! The map feature was killer and they definitely need to include this on the site.

Version 1.0.2 2011-08-11 5
 (Great deals & easy to use) App has great deals listed & is very user friendly!

Version 1.0.2 2011-08-11 5
 (Great App!) Easy to use! Excellent for last minute traveling.

Version 1.1 2011-08-10 1
 (Worst App Ever) The application would popup a "communication error" popup when I tried to select 50% sale.  I had to contact expedia.com to get the special and they still made an error with the stay duration.  Subsequently, after a ~2.5 hours trying to book my reservations with this app and working with the expedia representative we managed to double book my vacation package.  Now I'm trying to correct this issue.  This is the last vacation I book with this app or expedia.

Version 1.1 2011-08-10 5
 (Best app) Never rate but I just had to show some love. Good job guys!

 (Fast and easy) Great app, easy to use

Version 1.1 2011-08-10 5
 (Smooth!) Super easy to book, would like a user profile to store data for next time.

Version 1.1 2011-08-10 4
 (This is why I bought an iPhone) This app is amazing. It makes last minute traveling stress free. The map feature is great for making the right choice as it pertains to the area and price.

Version 1.0 2011-08-09 5
 (Awesome) Quick & fast. Expedia is awesome

Version 1.1 2011-08-09 4
 (Good all around booking tool) Way better than travelocity app

Version 1.1 2011-08-09 5
 (Awesome!) Easy to use, quick to use! Love it

Version 1.1 2011-08-09 4
 (Wow that was easy) Checked this against other ways to book from smart phone and this was no hassle, easy and great results

Version 1.1 2011-08-08 4
 (Great app) Does all that it needs to do, and does it well. Only things missing are an option to see satellite images on the map, and a way to log into your online expedia account.

Version 1.1 2011-08-08 1
 (Bugs, bugs, bugs...) Crashes doing the simplest of tasks.  Going from the map view to almost anywhere else crashes.  Needs major work before it is usable.

Version 1.1 2011-08-07 5
 (Love it....) Quick and Easy..... 

Version 1.1 2011-08-06 5
 (Fanastic!) Thanks for your help while in the Virgin Islands! Perfect and an easy to use app.

Version 1.1 2011-08-05 4
 (Easy...) I've booked 4 different vacations with this app, and each was as easy as one could hope for.

Version 1.1 2011-08-03 5
 (Awesome) Perfect app, smooth and easy to find hotels at a good price. Also includes access to reviews and amenities list. Super easy to make a reservation, and they email you a simple and clean receipt.

Version 1.1 2011-08-02 5
 (Awesome App) Very easy and quick. Found and booked a hotel in less than 2 minutes. Sweet deal.

Version 1.1 2011-08-01 1
 (Bad) Horrible! App is fine but customer service is horrendous! Phone lines are down, and that's the only way to change a reservation.

Version 1.1 2011-08-01 4
 (Expedia Hotels) The app is easy to use and works well. I definitely recommend it!

Version 1.1 2011-07-29 5
 (Phillies Phan) I use this app to find hotels in philly when going to see the Phantastic Phillies. It is fast fast fast...dependable and the prices are great too!

Version 1.1 2011-07-29 5
 (Great app) Super easy to use. Great stuff expedia!

Version 1.1 2011-07-28 5
 (Great!) This App. Is super easy to use, love it!

Version 1.1 2011-07-28 5
 (Does what it says!) I tried Orbitz and Bookit - horrible apps. Expedia worked like a charm and very easy/quick to use. Booked my hotel in less than 5 minutes!

Version 1.1 2011-07-27 5
 (Ridiculous) App is on point. Super smooth & easy to use. Definitely the best hotel app by a longshot.

Version 1.1 2011-07-26 5
 (Expedia) Incredible app, lightning fast, using current location is great, fantastic.

Version 1.1 2011-07-24 5
 (Great app!! Get it!! It's free!!) What an amazing app- was at hotel lobby check in desk - online rate was cheaper- booked it while I was standing at counter and they immediately received my reservation and checked me in quicker than if I would have checked in with the hotel at the desk and save $20.00!! It's fast and easy and it locates all hotels from where your current location is - WOW!!! I have never gave a review before- but this app deserved one!!!!!

Version 1.1 2011-07-24 3
 (Great but) Really an awesome app but you need to be able to look at your account and itinerary info after you book the hotel not just click to be sent to the website in safari. Also you should be able to review a hotel from the app.

Version 1.1 2011-07-24 5
 (Lifesaver!) Great App fast and easy!!! A++

Version 1.1 2011-07-23 5
 (Wonderful) Couldn't be easier

Version 1.1 2011-07-22 5
 (Great App) Very quick does exactly what it says.  Just booked my first hotel!

Version 1.1 2011-07-22 1
 (Crashes...) ...can't do anything. Zero stars.

Version 1.1 2011-07-20 2
 (Not the same Expedia!) Excited at first by how fast and easy to search for hotels, but soon realized not all hotels are listed in this app. Bottom line...useless.

Version 1.1 2011-07-18 5
 (Awesome App!) Really easy to use. Took hardly any time to find a hotel I wanted and booking was fast and easy.

Version 1.1 2011-07-18 5
 (Very User Friendly App) Downloaded and used this app for the first time this evening. Was able to easily find the hotel I wanted and book a room for the dates needed from the comfort of my chair on my iPad. Will definitely use this app in the future.

Version 1.1 2011-07-17 4
 (Easy to use but...) Very easy to use, but it doesn't have the option for smoking or no smoking room. Other than that it was great.

Version 1.1 2011-07-17 5
 (Nice and easy) Very user friendly!!!!   I will continue to use this app when booking rooms. 1st transaction was unbelievably easy and painless. 5 star !!!!!!!!

Version 1.1 2011-07-17 5
 (Just awesome) Looks beautiful and very intuitive!  Great work Expedia!

Version 1.1 2011-07-16 5
 (Great app) It is a life saver. I used it to book my room while I was boarding and when I got off the plane my room was ready.

Version 1.1 2011-07-16 5
 (Only Hotel App You Need!) After sitting in the hot sun on a motorcycle on I-70 waiting in an accident related backup for two hours it was obvious my hotel plans needed to be changed. With sketchy 3G service I downloaded 3 other, and higher rated apps only to find that they did not do what I needed. I needed to plug in a city and find a list of available rooms that included rate information and the ability to book the room without the hassle of being sent to a different browser. This app does it all in one stop, it could not be simpler. Wow a free app that is useful! When  booking hotels just a few hours before you will need them because you are unsure where you will end up (road-trip mode) this app will deliver. It just plain works, there are several sort and filter options, and it is intuitive. Get this one!!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-15 4
 (Update appreciated) Profound to the new update, this app was far from user friendly. I'm now impressed with the ease it took to book a room. Go job, Expedia.

Version 1.1 2011-07-14 5
 (Love the update!) Very happy with the added search options and user reviews! Great app and great team behind it!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-14 3
 (Works great - in the States) We booked two hotels within hours of check-in, and while on the road, with great results.  Unfortunately, while trying to book a hotel in Europe, the app keeps highlighting my billing street address as a problem.  I used the website to book the same hotel using exactly the same billing street address and was successful in booking.  Is this a bug, Expedia?  I think I updated versions between my States bookings and my overseas attempt to book.

Version 1.1 2011-07-14 4
 (Amazing update) Design is pretty awesome

Version 1.1 2011-07-14 4
 (Useful) While the iPhone app doesn't have the full functionality as the website, that's to be expected, it's a quite effective alternative on the go. New filters and sorting capabilities are a great improvement. Nice job!

Version 1.1 2011-07-14 5
 (Such a delight to use) Wow!  This is one of the best apps I've used.  Even sitting in front of my computer, I'll turn to this app before the website because it is much easier to use than even the Expedia site.  Nice touches include:

- Very fast, even with spotty Internet connection in the michigan's U.P.
- Autofill contact details from my contact with quick checkboxes to decide amongst my phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses in a couple quick taps.
- Map integration worked great.
- Navigating reviews was fast and easy.
- Images of hotels scrolled by with no work on my part, but I could swipe amongst them with immediate response.

Altogether, a real delight to use.

 (Bad Update) Crashes tje instant you click tje list format. Also crashed when click pn hotel name. Pls fix.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-11 5
 (Excellent!) This app is so easy and efficient. I love that it is organized by price, saves your address but not your credit card number, and adds the dates right to your iPhone calendar. Also there are no mix-ups if you need to cancel because the hotel's policy is spelled out before you confirm. I would highly recommend it.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-10 5
 (RN) Efficient, fast and saves money! The app is easy and hasn't let us down!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-09 5
 (Great for road trips!!) Very quick and easy to search and compare amenities and photos!! Will be using this often!!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-09 4
 (FabYardman1) Awesome AP. Awesome prices and shows location and map even in different countries..

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-09 5
 (Booking hotel made easy) Great apps, Fast, easy and clean user interface

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-09 5
 (Hotel app) Great app. User friendly. Super easy to use.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-08 1
 (Not linked to your account! Do not use!) Silly me, I assumed Expedia created this standalone app for hotels to make my life easier. Wrong! You'll notice in the screen shots that there is no user signed in. That's because you can't. Which means you end up with an orphan booking that does not appear in 'My Itineraries' on the website, which means no rewards points. Awesome! FAIL!!!!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-08 5
 (Amazing!) Worked great!!  Easy to use!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-08 5
 (Better) Better then priceline

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 2
 (Fairfield Marriott) Left us with much to be desired. No refrigerator or microwave. The room looks like a 1 or 2 star hotel. We were surprised that Marriott has their name out front.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 3
 (Fantastic Booking Flow...Needs Detailed Customer Reviews) Expedia did a great job with this app. It's one of the easiest hotel booking workflows I've ever seen. 

The one huge omission is detailed customer reviews. It's possible I just couldn't figure out where to find them, so if they're in there, my score jumps to 5 stars.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 4
 (Super easy) This was so quick and easy!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 1
 (Deleted it) In my humble opinion, just not enough customizable options. Especially for a family of six.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 5
 (Professional Driver) Excellent app! So fast and easy to use. Highly recommend it. Two thumbs up!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-06 5
 (Great App) This is a great app to browse hotels their prices and location.

Great layout and easy to use.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-05 5
 (So Easy!) I love this app. No need to shop around, Expedia makes travel arrangements quick and painless. So why not take a vacation!?  Really!?

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-05 3
 (Expediaapp) So simple and easy! I love this app!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-05 5
 (So easy!) This app is so fast and easy to use. I like it more then the actual website!

 (Fantasic app) Very easy to use, quick results!

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-04 5
 (Excellent app) Driving down a two lane highway in the hill country with little service and was still able to book my hotel for work this week, gotta love this app.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-04 5
 (Very nice) Excellent app.  Very easy and fun to use. Much faster than searching and booking over the computer.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-03 4
 (cool and fast - hotel notes and this won) Loved it, it was quick but I needed to add a note.  On the old Expedia version you could a note/request to your hotel you've booked.  In our case I was bring our pet, I to call the hotel directly and then call Expedia about my travel points.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-03 5
 (Awesome!) Real time inventory on 4th of July.

Version 1.0.2 2011-07-03 5

 (Great ap!) So easy to use and fast!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-28 1
 (Consumer beware!) I was prompted to download this app when I tried to go through an expedia email link on my Ipod Touch. Downloaded the app & didn't realize several of the fields were defaulted until after reservation was made (& charged). When I called expedia to revise the registration moments later, horrible customer service ensued & there was a bait & switch & they did not honor their clearly stated cancellation policy (which I read verbatim to them from their own email). Now I have reported them to the Better Business Bureau, have been charged 3x the advertised rate, & will never use them again.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-27 4
 (So quick n easy!) So quick n easy!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-26 3
 (Not expedia) Received the best rate but is not linked to expedia.com, very mis-leading

Version 1.0.1 2011-06-23 5
 (Great) Got a 150$ room for 54$!!!!!!! Great will def use again!!

Version 1.0.1 2011-06-23 5
 (Ez) Very easy to reserve. I like it.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-22 1
 (Easy booking!/IMPOSSIBLE to cancel reservation!) I am changing my review, from 5 stars to 1 though it should be ZERO! God help you if you have to cancel your reservation! On the phone for 20 minutes and STILL holding, prior to that, was being helped sort of. Expedia gives out 12 digit itinerary numbers except on this App. So a transfer call and the waiting begins! BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-21 5
 (Woot woot!!) EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED. Search in your area, or any desired destination, check your room, select, plug in your info and you're done! It took me five minutes max to find an affordable clean and comfy hotel in the rush of everything in Island of Adventure! Cool App

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-21 4
 (Cha-Ching!!) Just as promised. Quick, easy, and a FREE app to boot! Thanks guys, it's just what I needed!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-20 4
 (Very polished) I'm really impressed with this app.  Expedia clearly put a lot of time and thought into it.  It's very responsive, polished, and has a wonderful layout.  I just booked my first trip.  Thanks Expedia!

P.s.  This app is better designed than your website!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-20 5
 (Great app!) Just booked a hotel in no time!!! Fast intuitive and very informative. Good pictures of the hotels also was plus.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-19 2
 (Names) I couldn't figure out how to search for a specific hotel. The Expedia mobile site is much better.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-18 4
 (Nice app) Nice app. Processing image is awesome. Features are very nice. Look n feel is very nice. 4 because I cannot select freebie options before search.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-17 5
 (Awesome App!!!) Gave me a choices for hotels in Ibiza that were not even on the sites. 
Scored a room at a luxury boutique hotel in the middle of everything cheaper than mid range hotels on the island.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-17 5
 (I usually hate most apps. But this one...) This one is the best one ive ever downloaded. If i can give it a 10 star i would

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-16 5
 (Great app!!) Easy to use. Great interface, fast and lots of features.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-16 5
 (I love Expedia Hotels.) This is the best way to make a hotel reservation. It has all the details I could ever want and the prices as always are very affordable. Thank you to the developer, and please keep this in the App Store forever.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-16 5
 (Great) This app is easy to use and provides plenty of information. I just booked a room for a vacation trip in July, with no problem. A great app to have if you travel a lot; I highly recommend using it!!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-15 1
 (Don't use this app! No Expedia reward points!) Yea thanks a lot for the old bait and switch routine.  I used this supposed Expedia app. Only to find out after many phone calls to, I guess India, that this app booked me through Hotels.com, even though the confirm email said it was from Expedia!
I used this app so I could get the Expedia points! But that didn't happen because this app books you through Hotels.com which I was told by some of the sometimes hard to understand (outsourced to India)
But pleasant phone techs that Hotels.com is an affilliate of Expedia. Well that's great but the people who designed this app forgot that someone might likely use this app so they would get points credit for their reservations. 
Conclusion. After wasting hours on the phone  I cancelled the reservation and booked through Expedia.com on my laptop, and got my deserved points.  I will likely never use this app again and I will tell all my friends to do the same.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-13 4
 (Great. Thanks!) Wish we could save or favorite for later though.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-13 5
 (Awesome app!) Easy to use, fast, user friendly! I've used it several times already!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-13 1
 (Crash!) Weird that I'm the only one with this problem. I had iPhone 3GS and this app crashed every time I tried to search out of my local area. I thought it might just be my phone. I recently upgraded to iPhone 4 and the app crashes before opening. So, it's not my phone. Interesting that this app has 4 stars. Good thing it's free!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-12 5
 (Awesome) Very user friendly, fast, and easy...best free app I have:)

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-12 5
 (Awesome) Faster, better and security Thank you Expedia

 (Love the App) Quick and easy specially on my IPhone

Version 1.0.1 2011-06-10 5
 (Love it!) Very quick and easy! It works perfectly for me!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-10 5
 (Fantastic app) Really well done, I just wish there was an iPad version.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-10 1
 (AT&T iPhone 4) Nice app that won't accept my card info; therefore, I cannot book any of the hotels it located. Bank has confirmed that the problem is with Expedia. Oh well...

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-09 4
 (Works for me!) Had 10 minutes while sitting in traffic and I found a reasonable hotel for the next night. Traffic started up and I was done -- all on my phone. TY Expedia mobile.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-08 5
 (Nice) Quick and easy to use.

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-08 3
 (Great BUT ...) This app is really useful but when u want to cancel ur reservation or booking it does not let u know who did the booking.. I booked by this app n received my confirmation by email from EXPEDIA .. Changed my plans wanted to cancel my booking surprised it was booked by HOTELS.com .. Even though both r partners in booking but I wasted my time with the one n then it's the 2nd company .. I expect to receive my confirmation from who did my booking .. That's y I gave it a 3 star ..

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-08 5
 (Superb Work) This may be the best performing app I have ever used.  Where in the world have you been?

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-07 5
 (Great!!) I love it!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-07 5
 (Wow) It works as expected and very helpful

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-07 5
 (Awesome) Awesome app on the go..!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-06 5
 (Great first experience) Entire booking process went without a hitch - especially considering I was making the booking riding a NYC cab!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-05 5
 (So convenient) Easy to use!  We live out in the suburbs and decided to spend the night in town rather than drive back home. We downloaded the app and booked a great hotel within walking distance at a great price in under 5 minutes!

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-05 5
 (Fast, EZ to use,) Fast, summary informations, EZ to use

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-04 5

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-03 4
 (Easy to use) User friendly,calendars easily available ( a novel idea other travel sites haven't quite figured out) now all they have to do is get rid of the annoying brunette on their commercial and I'll give em the 5th star

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-02 5
 (Easy!) ^^

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-01 5
 (Cool and helpful app) Faster than using a computer. More precise and accurate results

Version 1.0.2 2011-06-01 5
 (That was easy!) Nothing more to say.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-31 5
 (Great for road trips!) Used the app for the first time during a cross-country road trip... Rates beat the price offered by calling ahead.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-31 5
 (Great app!) Fast & efficient! Great photos & info about each hotel. I love the cross reference features of the maps & tripadvisor reviews! I'll post an updated review after my trip.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-31 5
 (Fast. Efficient. Easy.) I download this app, found/reserved a hotel room, and received a confirmation - all within 5 minutes. Enough said. :)

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-31 5
 (Great app) Easy to navigate! I do wish you could log into your account and see my trips.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-30 4
 (Very easy to book) We booked our hotel from the highway..... Easiest hotel booking I've ever done!

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-30 5
 (Awesome!) So easy to use. Highly recommend.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-30 5
 (Love it!) Love the app, it makes everything easier.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-29 4
 (Awesome and well designed.) Just like everyone else, I wish I could use the info saved in my Expedia account to make booking faster. Outside of that tho, it does exactly what it says on the tin.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-29 5
 (Super Easy) Very simple and effective.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-29 3
 (Convenient but could be better) I agree that linking to online account would make this app perfect.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-28 5
 (Great) An amazing and very handy app!!!!

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-27 2
 (Good for finding hotels...) It's just not very convenient for booking if you have an Expedia account. That's why I have my info saved, so I don't have to enter it every time. If that were fixed, it would be practically perfect!

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-27 3
 (Good But!!!) App work Great does everything it claims.  One thing that I think stinks I'd that it doesn't tie into your Expedia account like the flight app does.  It would make sense for it to do that and have flights and hotels and car rentals all there.  Unless I missed something this is just stand a stand alone app to book a room.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-26 5
 (Great app) Love it

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-25 5
 (Perfect) Great functionality and extremely easy to use. Found what I was looking for in an instant! Great app!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-24 5
 (Excellent!) Excellent!

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-24 5
 (Wonderful; functional) Very simple yet elegant and fast app that did exactly what I wanted. Allows you to search hotels for an area, compare star ratings, includes brief write-ups, and let's you book your room, all with a surprisingly few number of clicks. Couldn't be happier.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-23 5
 (GREAT!!!) Super easy navigating and booking!

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-22 5
 (Awesome) Traveling the US on my KLR650. Can book any hotel from anywhere. Prices are great, details are great. Perfect for people on the move.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-19 1
 (Does not work) This app isn't working.

Version 1.0.2 2011-05-19 1
 (No hotels found) Having the same problem.  No matter what dates I search.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-19 1
 (NO RESULTS!! WONT WORK!!) Keeps saying "no hotels found" needs to be fixed ASAP!!! Once fixed I'll give more stars but for now it's ZERO stars!!!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-17 2
 (No link to account ??????) Easy to search and navigate, but why wouldn't this app be linked to an existing account? Should be better integrated with the trip assist app for an easier booking experience. It was easier to go to the website via browser for booking than having to input all my billing info again.…

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-15 4
 (Great app) Easy use

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-14 2
 (Neat app) Very easy app. Havent got to check in to make sure booking is as smooth as it seems. So will be back to rate better. Afta i do.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-14 1
 (Keeps crashing!) This app stinks - it won't even start since it crashes within 3 seconds of starting!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-14 5
 (Too Easy!!!) I was done in less than 3 minutes...including the search!!
Love it!!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-14 5
 (Amazing App!) This app makes finding a good hotel at a great price so easy...it took me less than 5 minutes to find and book a hotel.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-13 5
 (Too good!) Simple yet amazing app. Very user friendly. Provides the right amount and relevant details about hotels. Please add car rentals as well.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-12 5
 (Better than the site) Same great prices, but more streamlined layout, very quick and easy to book. Recommend!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-11 5
 (Excellent AAA+++++) Always got better rates from Expedia compared to walk-in from  $20/day to as much as $50/day with Marriott, Hyatt, and Hilton. Super APP!!!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-11 5
 (Great app!) This app is great! I haven't checked in the hotel yet but we just booked a room and I don't think the process could be any easier!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-11 4
 (Easy to use) Good app to book rooms when on the go.

Only drawback you can't logon to your existing expedia.com account or I would have given it 5 stars.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-10 4
 (Good, but can be better) Great deals on here that not even expedia.com has online. Just need better integration between app and online account.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-08 5
 (It can't get any easier!) Tried a number of different apps and methods and this one makes it the easiest to book the best price at some of the best hotels. And no taking gambling with naming my price and being locked in to a possible mistake. 

Love it!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-07 5
 (Awesome!) This app is great to book hotels with! Just put in a location and you can find a place either on the map or scrolling thru a list. It's very clear and easy to use. I highly recommend this app.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-06 5
 (Wonderful prices!!!) I am so happy with this app. We got cheaper prices than had we used our military discount which is usually quite significant. Everything is very fast and convenient, a good one-stop app. Will recommend it!!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-06 5
 (Wow!) Quick and to the point. Very attractive interface. Great photos and reviews. Who needs a computer anymore!?

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-05 5
 (Quick and easy!) Great app will use it from now on easier to book hotels

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-05 5
 (This app is da BOMB!!) I really like this app! Cheap rates. Pictures, special rates/sales, booking is so easy!

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-04 4
 (Great app!!!) Excellent user experience interface. As a web/graphic designer I appreciate the aesthetics of the application as well as the ease of use. 

We were driving from Orlando to Miami and had no place to spend the night. We were not only able to find a great deal (given the timeframe) but also made the reservation in just few easy steps. Loved it! 

Only thing i would suggest is the ability to place a call to the hotel (if needed), and the ability to enlarge the photos for  a better view.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-02 1
 (Beware Expedia) I'd like to share my experience with Expedia.

I was on my way to Las Vegas and needed a room. After checking sites I booked a room through Expedia. When I arrived the next person to come to the check-in desk didn't have a reservation—and got a room for $20 less than what I'd paid Expedia. Normally, I would expect that the hotel would match the rate, but since I'd booked through Expedia they couldn't.

When I shared this story through the Expedia site they disallowed it, and it wasn't posted. (The tone of my comments were similar to those here.)

That has been my only experience with Expedia. Can you blame me for not giving them more chances?

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-02 1
 (Expedian't) Nice interface. But it takes 2 hours for the order once they charge your card to get to the Hotel. I had a last minute booking and I when I got to the hotel 2 hours later they still had no record. And with no way to fax an order in I had to cancel with Expedia and book directly with the hotel. For me and this first time use it was useless and certainly did not live up to an "Expedia" name. In this digital age why should ANYTHING like this take 2 hours? Next time I'll use pigeons.

Version 1.0.1 2011-05-01 1
 (U can't get rewards points with this app) I used the app to book a hotel and my purchase was "outsourced" to hotels.com without my approval. I got a expedia email with a hotels.com confirmation number and I didnt get my expedia rewards points. Everyone at expedia thought i was crazy when I tried to explain this problem to them. Better to purchase directly from their site or use priceline instead.

Version 1.0.1 2011-04-29 4
 (Great info. Needs login option) Super app but should be able to log into your expedia account.

Version 1.0 2011-04-29 2
 (Pretty App... But lacks a lot of functionality) Can't sign in or retrieve trips. Page curl is annoying in the hotel list since it occasionally works. Does not have a lot of hotels compared to the site.

Version 1.0.1 2011-04-29 3
 (Sign in???) Won't let me sign into my account. Pain to fill out personal info and credit card every time. Old app didn't do that.

Version 1.0 2011-04-25 5
 (Very nice app) Really easy to use and the map view really helps in shopping for hotels . 
Wish expedia will integrate this with flights and car booking.

Version 1.0 2011-04-22 1
 (Cavs) R

Version 1.0 2011-04-20 4
 (Very good) I hope to add travel offers app

Version 1.0 2011-04-20 5
 (Great travel companion!) And to think your commercials used to make me want to change the channel! Now thanks to this app, I will always book with expedia!

Version 1.0 2011-04-20 5
 (Fast and easy) Great program

Version 1.0 2011-04-19 5
 (Great App) Better than Kayak, Travelocity, and Priceline. Easy to use. Very nice UI and lots of details about hotels.

Version 1.0 2011-04-19 5
 (Great App) I used it to look at hotels in the area I would be in, and ended up booking through this app. It was very easy and convenient to use.

Version 1.0 2011-04-18 5
 (Awesome) Worked like a charm!

Version 1.0 2011-04-18 3
 (MAPS!?) Very nice app! Only thing I don't understand is why will it show where the Hotel is on the map but won't give you directions to the hotel via GPS/ Google maps? It's one thing if the hotel is near where you live but if your out of town and don't know the area? You would have to back out of the app then type the address into the GPS  on the iPhone. Link would be nice.

Version 1.0 2011-04-17 5
 (What a Blessing this app is!!!) Couldn't make it to destination last night - downloaded Expedia app with only one bar showing on my iphone - in the middle of the mountains - launched Expedia app & searched for hotels - so quick - & what a great deal! Check in was immediate, about 5 mins. This is a fantastic app! Don't delay download it today!!!! What a blessing that I had it to use last night to find some physical rest! God will use anything to bring glory to Himself & grace to us in our time of need!

Version 1.0 2011-04-16 5
 (Fastest and Best design I've ever seen) This is the perfect App for those that want to see what's around and book a room in under 2 minutes. Quickest booking I've ever done and still felt like I saw every detail of the hotel I booked. Expedia is doing it right!

Version 1.0 2011-04-16 4
 (Almost Great) Good app but it takes two more things to get five stars in my eyes... (1) design for both iPhone & iPad and (2) fix a couple of bugs when searching from the visible map area and then changing the date range.

Version 1.0 2011-04-15 5
 (Remember, these are Expedia rates!) If you have a special group or rate code (AAA, etc.), you can't take advantage of it with sites like Expedia—you're better off booking directly through the hotel. 

Other than that, this is hands down the best-looking app of it's kind that I've seen. Absolutely beautiful. Well done!

Version 1.0 2011-04-15 5
 (He'll ya) Great prices my new booking agent

Version 1.0 2011-04-14 3
 (Slick, but not terribly useful) I love using expedia on the web for hotels. The app, not so much. They need to have a location search like Orbitz's app (its ugly though). So let's say you want a hotel downtown Chicago. On expedia app you give dates and the city-- and ALL chicago hotels are listed. There's no way of knowing which are downtown or suburban or wherever. At least on the crudely looking Orbitz app you can refine your Chicago (or wherever) search to predertimined areas: downtown, south side, airport, etc. Which is EXTREMELY helpful- and saves a lot of time.

Version 1.0 2011-04-14 4
 (No longer available?) I love this app but my wife wants it on her iPhone and when she tries to download it she gets a message saying that it's no longer available. What gives?

Version 1.0 2011-04-13 5
 (Love it!!!) Used this app on "the fly" while in providence. Worked like a charm. 10 minutes to book n check in. Great!!

Version 1.0 2011-04-13 4
 (Not bad) Pretty darn good app but it needs phone numbers to tap and call

Version 1.0 2011-04-13 5
 (Nice) Great app very clean and easy to use, one recommendation would be to add more specific room info, ie king suite includes ocean view 550 sq ft. bathrobes, honor bar, etc. and possibly specific room pictures/virtual tours if available. Overall round one, great job!!

Version 1.0 2011-04-13 1
 (Search Problem!!!) When search the app crash....!!!!

Version 1.0 2011-04-13 5
 (Love it) Easy n fast NICE!!!

Version 1.0 2011-04-13 5
 (Best hotel app ever!) Graphic are awesome. So smooth and easy to use. Love it and will use it. Beats all other hotel apps. Way to go Mobiata and Expedia.

Version 1.0 2011-04-12 1
 (This has to be a joke) It won't search by typing city state, or using iphone  gps on or off, this app needs to be Repaired!!!! Why should this app need to have iphone gps turned on?

Version 1.0 2011-04-11 1
 (Needs a lot of improvement!) Nice app, but needs a lot of improvement! When I book a hotel I want to be able to not only book the hotel but also have the flight included or maybe even a rental car. You can't even search by name of hotel! Retarded. This app is way too basic, I'll stick with Kayak Pro.

Features Needed:
• Ability to search/book for Hotel+Flight+Car.
• Search for Hotels by "Name"
• Read and Write Reviews.

Version 1.0 2011-04-11 5
 (Great looking app needs a few additional features in the next version) This is one of the smoothest apps I've seen... great interface and fantastic images ( I hope it performs OK on 3G as well as wifi!)

Needs link to trip advisor app to read reviews.

Version 1.0 2011-04-11 5
 (Love it; travel made easy) Just browsed some hotels nearby; good display and love the ability to switch from the map view to the list view.

Version 1.0 2011-04-11 2
 (Lack of options) Very nice looking but that's it. Whe you choose a period of your leave and the number of people you will be, it gives you only the price of the room pervnight, not for the whole period. Other thing I do not like is that I cant read other people reviews and cant wright one. Not many options in the Settings menu.

Version 1.0 2011-04-11 4
 (Wow) Now this is a cool app!! Every hotel search app needs to be like this!

Version 1.0 2011-04-11 1
 (Keeps crashing) Every time I try to click on a search result, the app closes.

Version 1.0 2011-04-10 4
 (Nice place to stay) I've stayed here lots of time it's a clean  place and in the center of Sandiego close to all

Version 1.0 2011-04-10 5
 (Perfect!!!) Wonderful app. Easy to use. Searching is a breeze. Great job!!!

Version 1.0 2011-04-09 5
 (Pleasant experience) I'm shocked at how much I enjoy using this app. The UI is really well done and the results are relevant. Very nice job.

Version 1.0 2011-04-09 5
 (Very nice!) Even if you think you can get a cheaper rate through another service, this is the best app for viewing rooms, locales, pics. 
Please keep adding hotels to your database expedia. Thanks!

Version 1.0 2011-04-09 3
 (Turn off the location service) I am not sure why the app needs to default to your current location.  Its pretty seldom that I don't actually have a place when I am actually on-site.  If I was stuck in an airport in Chicago, I suppose it could come in handy.  But even then, I could just type "OHare".   I suppose it would come in handy if I didn't know where I was.  But the last time that happened, I had been kidnapped and was in the trunk of a car, so I wasn't really concerned about a hotel.  It just wastes my time when I open the thing up and the phone has to first search for my location using the GPS.

And if you are going to default to current location, I think you could at least have a sort option for "distance".

Another issue, limit the total distance in a search, especially if you sort by price.  I don't think I need to know that the cheapest hotel available is the Stinkpot Motel 42 miles south of my target location.  Maybe 10-15 miles is a good place to stop.

Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
 (Simplistic Genius!!  Packages Please!!) These guys totally redeemed themselves with this one...expedia's other attempts have been terrible and should be removed from the store (their brands have suffered enough from these embarrassing "apps"...this plants the seed for greatness, where's the flights, packages apps:)?  If done right, expedia could reclaim their glory...and, I'll be one happy euro traveler!

Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
 (Best UI ever.) And the rest of it works, too!

Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
 (Best Hotel Booking App!) A must have if you are constantly on the go and need a quick way to find a hotel at a great rate.

Version 1.0 2011-04-08 4
 (Very nice!) Very cool app and easy to use! Would have given a 5 but you cant read reviews, which I believe would be useful to everyone.

Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
 (WOW!) It takes a great app. for me to type up a review and this is one of them. This is the best hotel app. ever. So easy to use and the interface is beautiful. Nice job, Expedia!

Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
 (Great app.) And for free app, it's amazing app. Especially for travellers!

Version 1.0 2011-04-08 4
 (They've done it again…) Those Mobiata Masters of UI design have actually made the task of finding hotels fast and fun. Kudos!

Would be nice to see customer reviews and a mechanism to bookmark/favorite the hotels you're interested in (-1 star).

Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
 (Great app) Great, nice graphics, map view, list view.

Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
 (Great!) Quick, easy to use.

Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
 (Awesome) Very nice and clean UI. Easy to use and to navigate. Great job Expedia!

Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
 (Easy to use and on the eyes) The Expedia app has a great UI and I mean GREAT. The date-range picker is the best I've used! The app is fast as well. It finds hundreds hotels near you within seconds and shows you their price, location and availability. And with the unbeatable price, it's a no-brainer. A must-have for travelers!

Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
 (So easy!) I like this a lot! So much easier than dealing with their website. I do hope they add flights and cars eventually.  5 stars for this implementation.

Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
 (Nice job Mobiata) Another great, best-class user experience!

Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
 (UI is awesome!) This app is useful and even better it is well designed! The UI is easy to understand and clean. Awesome app. Thanks.

Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
 (Nice looking app!) Seriously whoever put time into the design of this app is from the future. The intro screens rocking door hanger, hash marks on the scroll to indicate trip advisor ratings, and the, very easy to use date selector (Apple take notes) on the calendar. Superb!
