I downloaded this app because I had no luck with the mobile site on my tablet. The title of this app is misleading. It says "hotels & flights" but you can neither search nor book flights with this app. What a waste of cyberspace. Neither your mobile website nor your app would let me do what I want to do, which is to give you money. What a terrible mobile strategy. You lose. I go to orbitz.com.
Version 3.5.3 2014-03-25 1
You can't search flights on the app for flights and hotels?  How can it be rated differently?
Version 3.5.3 2014-03-25 1
Why can I not book my hotel?! Message saying they're having a problem keeps popping up. Not convenient if that keeps going on!
Version 3.5.3 2014-03-25 4
I love the app. I was trying to book on the website and had no luck, due to too much traffic. I was able to use the app to book a room for my husband with relative ease.  It isn't the most intuitive, but it was also the first time I've used it.

I love Expedia & this app.  It makes booking a flight & hotel so much easier. !!
Version 3.5.3 2014-03-23 4
I had no problem, finding, & booking a hotel. The hotel even popped up on my app,when I was looking for the address.
Version 3.5.3 2014-03-23 1
Can't book vacation from the app, and hard to use for searching!! Take time to refresh when open it. Don't know why Expedia not even focus on improving the functions of the app!!!
Version 3.5.3 2014-03-23 1
Was booking the hotel anyway and got lured in with a false promise of a $25 coupon.  Of course it doesn't work!  I like the app...but pretty mad the coupon code doesn't work!
Version 3.5.3 2014-03-22 1
Expedia is the most priciest travel site out there. Sometimes airlines sell tickets cheaper than Expedia does. Try kayak instead, much better app and cheapest than everything else out there.

I really like the Expedia app; it has a great user interface. The app is very straight forward and easy to understand. However, it really frustrates me how I can't share a hotel/flight directly from the app; instead I'm jumping through hoops; opening in Safari, then sharing from there. It's a pain. (The convince of technology is important) The app would be 100% better with that feature. Beyond that one thing, I highly recommend using this app!

This app is so easy to use, it works well, never crashes for me. Expedia offers competitive prices and I love it for booking flights on the go. They are amazing for customer support, I just called and they refunded me my ticket for cancelation even though I was slightly past the 24 hour cut off. 5 stars!

Changes to your itinerary made at the web site or outside if it -- such as airline flight changes, cancellations, etc. not reflected in the app. Had to cancel a trip due to weather and I still get announcements about hotel check out, flight delays. Very annoying and confusing.

This iPhone App seems to be totally useless.  Once I navigated away from my itinerary all I can see is pretty pictures of various destinations.  There seems to be no way to get back to the beginning where I was. I've tried every button and icon I see and I've even tried closing the App and it just reopens to the same place. If I was standing at the airport counter trying to find my itinerary it would be a catastrophe.
Version 3.5.3 2014-02-03 5
cheap prices and fast
Version 3.5.3 2014-02-02 1
I was excited when I first opened the app. The design, flow, integrations were are done super well and I was about to give it 5 stars... Then I tried to actually use the app. Signing in with Facebook made me link accounts, and linking account hang. When I tried to go around the login and just enter the itinerary code for my flight it wouldn't let me copy paste the info in the app! 13+ digits to remember from an email on the device.... Not a chance. So basically using the app is useless for me other than finding flight which I already use Kayak for. Fail.
Version 3.5.3 2014-01-31 1
I've downloaded the app but it is stuck open in my App Store and prevents me from looking for other apps or updating the ones I have.  Please help!

Hello,

I don't really write to
many reviews however, this little app saved my skin several times during my trip. First it reminded me that I could check-in 24-30 hours prior to, which ensured my family sat together on the plane and, coupled with the car rental it was seamless. The car rental direction option really saved my bacon because the rental cars GPS malfunctioned and the app
on my iPhone in tandem with maps of course lead me right to the parking spot
for the rental. This app was really well thought out and, I was an Expedia fanboy before however, this just brought it all together for me. Thank you Expedia.com, you put the planning in the back ground and reserved that time for whats important and , in my case it was the utilization  of every moment of family time.

Very Respectfully,

J. P.
Version 3.5.2 2014-01-29 3
Thats all..
Version 3.5.2 2014-01-26 3
I would like to see this app have more functionality line the website. Every time I want to update my current quote I have to redue the entire process. It's frustrating because an app is supposed to make searching the same if not easier than the website. It doesn't need all the flair as much as it needs more functionality.
Version 3.5.2 2014-01-26 4
It is a very nice looking app, and works fairly well, but it has a glitch that I could find no way to report.  I booked three different cars, and even though the Expedia, and Enterprise sites both say I rented a Midsized SUV, the app says I rented a Midsized Car.
Version 3.5.2 2014-01-26 5
Add to that they have great coupon codes you can apply!
Version 3.5.2 2014-01-26 5

can only search within 10 miles? horrid. using booking.com and hopefully it will be better.

update: not sure if expedia prices are better, but the booking.com app is much better!! you have a lot more to search with and filters. expedia's app is so horrid it makes me cringe.
Version 3.5.2 2014-01-25 3
Tried to use Expedia app to book flight tickets.  For number of travelers, the app does not allow to put in children.  There is a difference in ticket price between adult and children tickets. Need to correct this bug.

Version 3.5.2 2014-01-23 2
The screen turns black and if I wish to continue I have to delete the app and download the app again.
Otherwise when it was working fine I was able to track my itineraries, was a good app.
Version 3.5.2 2014-01-23 1
Searching the same flights on a PC web browser will quote prices approximately $100 lower than when using this app.    I have tested this three times over the past three days. The same flights appear from both access points in parallel searches, but all prices are $100 higher from the app.
Version 3.5.2 2014-01-22 4

This is such a bad app. You can only search for a flight or hotel. No packages, no cruises, no cars. The hotels are missing vital information like the distance to near by attractions. The only thing it's good for is telling you if your flight is on time.

I downloaded this just to warn everyone of expedias terrible business practices. Expedia is one of the most indifferent and illegitimate travel companies when it comes to customer service. They have given my entire family the run around for 3 days now, including disconnecting us, and telling us they will call us back and then never following through. All our family wants is to be recognized as human beings and to see some effort from the company. After being ignored for this long we will never use Expedia again, and furthermore will let our friends and colleagues know of our terrible experience. All you had to do was show some humanity.

My family and friends can finally track all my flights in the app! I've been waiting for this feature for like ever! Thank you Expedia, the app looks amazing and you guys keep adding features I love. When are you guys updating the iPad app?
Version 3.5.2 2013-12-22 2
I wasn't able to use the app to book 2 rooms!! I entered 4 guests but app won't let me split it into 2 guests per room.
Also I tried using my Amex card and app kept asking me to enter the cvv on the back of the card but the done button won't activate until I enter a 4th digit. Thinking it's a 4 digit validation for Amex, I entered the code on the front of the card but the app won't accept it and the cars auth kept failing .

Oh yeah I can't book hotel and flight together with this smart app as well, let alone other options.. 

Dumb app!!

The app works well, but it seems like you only get a subset of search results versus the full website. This renders the app useless. If they have separate deals, one has to search both!

I believe the app is great if you're flying with all adults but I am flying with an 11-year-old and a 14-year-old this app will not allow me to select anybody under an adult I think this app needs an update so you can select how many children you will be flying with an age appropriateness for an accurate price range thank you very much

The app shows different prices then the ones shown on the website, it doesn't allow you to choose when to pay for a hotel(immediately or on check in) and it doesn't warn you about those things too. The login experience is terrible and there is no option to modify your account via the app.

Otherwise, it is usable and the GUI is nice and smooth.

I would give a five star rating if they fix the aforementioned problems.

It was easy as 1, 2, 3 to buy a plane ticket and gave me unobtrusive hotel option in case of an emergency. Do not waste your time with Orbitz or Travelocity! I wasted a lot of money with Orbitz, and I saved hundreds with Expedia. Thank you for getting me to my family! Easy 5 star rating from me.

I am an Expedia Elite member, as I book over 350 rooms a year on my account. This app runs very poorly and has a lot of user issues. Other than the fact that about 30% of my bookings on here don't go through there are many other problems. My main problem is that you can't book multiple rooms at a hotel at a time. I book at least 3 rooms per night on tour (as a band) and I have to use the app 3 times for each night (at minimum, since it often doesn't go through). I love the deals on Expedia but they need to put some money and time into their app or get quicker phone service (as I often have to call in about app issues).
Version 3.5 2013-11-21 5

Love every part of this app. Real time notifications are probably the coolest feature. It even tells you when your gate has changed!
Version 3.5 2013-11-20 1
So Counterintuitive.  Their web page works just fine.  On this worthless app you cannot figure out how to combine a flight with hotels, and cars for that matter.  Sorry for the disaster in the Philippines, but this is a crap Filipino product.
Version 3.5 2013-11-20 3
The app is super easy to navigate and user friendly.  However, the app does not have the function to search for hotel/flight vacation packages.
Version 3.5 2013-11-19 3
But there is still room for improvement. Price offers are not the same as on the web. 
No matter what you select every time you have to log in again after starting the app.
Version 3.5 2013-11-19 5
Expedia has really knocked this one out of the park and I love the real time alerts!  I was sitting at the airport in Chicago and received a notice from Expedia that my flight was delayed, but the airline showed it was still on time.  Sure enough, five minutes later, American Airlines updated the gate info to show the delay, but Expedia's data was real time!

This is good app for the ipad. I was able to see the same hotel and airfare availability as on the full internet site. 

The only issue I have is that the MOBILE25 coupon code does not apply to MANY if not ALL the hotels I can ever think of staying at! Where CAN you use this at? The fine print is so long with non-eligible hotels!
Version 3.4.1 2013-11-14 3
Meh, Kayak is a much better app. I wish we had the option (+/- 3 days) or something because I'll trying to find which day of departure would be the cheapest but this app requires me to KNOW when I want to leave
Version 2.1 2013-11-14 1
Don't waste your time and money. The forgot to book my reservation, so I had to got to another hotel. Asked for my money back, and they said it was impossible. Also: after comparing directly with the hotel, the "special quote" they "found" for me was exactly the same as the one of the hotel.
Version 3.4.1 2013-11-14 1
This app is good for nothing. The website is a thousand times better than the app.
Version 3.4.1 2013-11-13 3
Cool
Version 3.3 2013-11-13 2
Don't forget to watch for a place to enter the coupon code. I generally prefer booking travel on my computer, but got this app specifically to use the coupon mentioned in the description. I never saw a place to enter the coupon code, but the app said something like "the price just went down" so I thought that maybe that was the discount. Not so! Only after I'd booked my hotel did I realize that I got the same price as on the web. And I can't figure out how to complain.

This smacks of bait & switch.
Version 3.4.1 2013-11-13 1
Since the last update, the App crashes on my iPhone 4S. I hear the iPhone 4 is affected by the same issue as well. 

It had been a couple of weeks now and Expedia has not fixed this. Please do something. Otherwise you will be losing a lot of business. 

The only reason I did not give it zero stars is that it is not possible.
Version 3.4.1 2013-11-11 5

When I got this app I was very impressed with the user interface and ease of use. But there are three things that make it unhelpful for frequent flyers:
1. The name of every itinerary is "Mobile". If you book several flights you can't see which is which. 
2. You can not enter your frequent flyer number - even when it is available on your profile. You have to go into the web version to add in your FF number. If you forget, you will miss upgrades and points.
3. The app only does round trips or one-ways. You can not set up a multi-step itinerary.

If expedia can solve these three problems and I will give it 5 stars.

Great concept Expedia.  Why don't you check to see how competitive u really are though.  

You should really consider downloading this app if u want to pay more money for your rooms and not have the ability to cancel without Paying a penalty!

Here's your sign.......

I like it!
Version 3.2 2013-07-30 5
Good
Version 3.2 2013-07-30 3
It is is 2013 the app should have an "add to passbook" option if you want Expedia to make the extra mile towards user friendliness ~ I see no reason why other apps include the passbook option and Expedia does not. Besides that, well designed interface.
Version 3.2 2013-07-30 5
Very good Love it
Version 3.2 2013-07-29 5
Very good app. Very very usefull

We stayed with our two young kids. The bathroom was filthy. Hair in the shower, bathroom floor and the sink by the refrigerator. We had 4 people staying in the room and had two towels. The tv kept freezing up and didn't work half the time. The room smelled like cigarettes. Im not 100% sure the bed was clean. carpet was dirty. It was an awful stay. Do not stay there.
Version 3.2 2013-07-28 5
Great!
Version 3.2 2013-07-28 5

Great app all around!
Version 3.2 2013-07-09 1
Trollllllll
Version 3.2 2013-07-08 1
Very slick app but beware of getting baited with a cheap price and switched at the end of transaction with higher price charged to your credit card.
Version 3.2 2013-07-08 1
WHEN are you going to make this a FULL Service App and add Rent A Car providers and bookings so users can book their Complete and Entire travel package? Can I rate you a ZERO until then?
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-08 1
This is the worst app. As if booking flights and hotels wasn't stressful enough this app takes it to a whole new level! Not only does it take one thousand years to find the specific hotel you're looking for, despite the fact that you ENTERED THE EXACT ADDRESS, it also won't let you use any coupon codes, just for the hell of it. Unless you like the urge to literally smash your iPhone against a glass wall and feel the shards of glass slice open your limbs.... DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-08 5
Best Western hotel was clean and Friendly. Great breakfast as well I loved it
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-08 5
Love this app!
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-07 5
It help me do the math for going to New York
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-07 3
I used to use this app for such a long time but it's been crashing on startup so much, I've been forced to go to another app for my hotel needs. Fix this soon Expedia
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-07 3
This app is good for this summer
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-05 5
Easy to use! Love it!
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-04 1
Only certain hotels qualify (prepay Expedia hotels) for the $25 off discount advertised when you sign up. This app does not tell you which hotels qualify which is a glitch within the app itself. After speaking to 2 different Expedia representatives, they admitted that there was a glitch and reported it but would not honor the coupon code even though it was their mistake. Decided to cancel the reservation and go with another company. FYI- Priceline had my same hotel room for $7 cheaper nightly rate. App is user friendly but worthless when company behind it does not honor it. Will not use Expedia again!
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-04 3
Beautiful and easy to use, but no way to book flights and hotel as a package. Major flaw.
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 1
Every time I try to book a hotel, the app crashes and I can't have a cheap, memorable vacation
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 5
This app just works perfectly when you needed it, can only recommend. Quick, easy to use and responsive! I just live it and would recommend to all out there! The passbook save of reservations is a great addition, thanks!
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 5
Can't imagine any improvements. Very cool.
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 3
The app itself works great; I have no complaints about that. I however feel pretty scammed after seeing that I could supposedly receive $25 off my first $100+ booking but the having the coupon code fail to deliver. I thought at first it might be a glitch with site, but after seeing other reviews detailing the same problem I realized it's a hoax. Nice, Expedia.
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 5
Es increible esta aplicacion en 3 sencillos pasos tienes todo la busqueda muy simple, la sescripcion y el pago en dos pasos..... La mejor aplicacion del mundo para reservas....  Diafrutenla....!!!!
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-03 5
Great appl!
Version 3.1.1 2013-07-02 5
Love, love, love this App! I do a lot of leisure travel and this app makes booking super convenient and they offer great discounts.  I all really prefer the mapping functions on the app vs the website.  Excellent and I'm looking forward to using it during my travels.
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-30 5
This app is great for finding hotels near your destination point.  The map is very helpful.  Full color photos and lots of reviews to help you find just what your looking for.
Version 2.2 2013-06-29 3
I got here from a slender app seriously
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-29 5
I can book anywhere!!!!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-29 5
This hotel was great! The staff...I can't even describe how hard these people work to make your stay feel so good! Not only was everything within walking distance, it made life so much easier. The room was so comfy as well. We had a blast! Thanks to everyone at the Washington Plaza!!!
Version 3.1 2013-06-29 5
So easy to use and find exactly what you need quickly.
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-28 5
This app was super easy and I was able to email confirmation to those needing copy.
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-28 1
I was supposed to receive 5% off of my hotel booking by using the Expedia app. I used the Expedia app and it did not work.
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-27 4
Easy to use, great features and pictures, I may find it cheaper elsewhere but I love Expedia and their tools!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-27 5
Loved it
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-26 5
Extremely easy to use and esthetically pleasing! Most travel friendly app!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-26 4
Fast, Easy ... Good Prices!
Immediate Confirmation!
My Mobile Hotel Finder From Now On!
Version 1.4.1 2013-06-25 5
Easy to see hotel and ratings and pics and just book with my already existing acct
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-25 5
This was awesome for last minute booking while driving from Texas to the Keys!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-24 5
It's very good because all time I find best price in the US
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-24 5
works great with retailmenot's codes for online bookings :)
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-24 5
Fast clean booking
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-23 5
Better than the others
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-23 3
Maybe I'm missing something, but you can't search air & hotel as a package.
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 4
This is by far the best hotel app.  If you have an Expedia account, it makes it extremely simple and quick to find, look and pay for a room anywhere.
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 5
Easy to use and actually had prices lower than Kayak on a few searches.
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 5
Works perfectly!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 4
Thankz expedia love this app!!!!!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 4
Easy from the get go to use.  However, unless I didn't see it, I would love a filter allowing me to see only the hotels within the map view as I change it.
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-22 1
Keeps crashing!!!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-21 5
We are a road trip, booking rooms as we go and this app is a lifesaver!!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-20 5
this app is much more easy to use and very simple! highly recommended!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-19 5
Very easy to use
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-19 5
Super easy!!
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-18 2
Expedia advertised its app on Tapjoy with a 333 (quite large) bonus points.... But at least for me it failed to deliver.

+ App works fine for finding a location, a hotel.

- App does not provide / allow for government /military rate discounts
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-18 5
Used the new app for the first time and pleasantly surprised.
Version 3.1.1 2013-06-18 4
Easy to use and fast to book
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-26 5
Well designed.  Intuitive interface stepped me through the best deals for each hotel near my destination.  30 fresh reviews available even for a hotel off the interstate in a small town.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-26 4
Proper functionality
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-25 1
I tried to book and date was well hidden, so booked hotel 11 hour drive away for same evening as booking and Expedia wouldn't help to change. Just charged card. Hotel was much more accommodating. 
Be careful they will try and deceive and just take money without offering service. 
App about to be deleted from iPad. Goodbye Expedia, hello others with good service reps.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-25 1
Even when it says that the app is also for flights it doesnt let you search flights. It is only for hotels. Unlike the one for iPhone.
Version 2.3.1 2013-04-25 5
This app is awesome. That one touch add it to calendar button really sealed the deal, but everything else already seemed really well designed, both functionally and aesthetically. By far one of the more pleasant experiences on such a small screen. Great job.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-24 4
The is real good once you book your flight. Nice graphical view with every detail being user friendly.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-24 1
This is repeated daily spam on my FB newsfeed and I am so sick of seeing it as a suggested app.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-23 4
Looks like the iPad version is only for hotels. Good thing I'm not  the only one having this problem. I thought I was blind or going crazy.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-23 1
You can't book flights with this app, even though you can on the iPhone.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-22 1
Why do I shop Expedia? For FLIGHTS! The App will let me shop for flights on the iPhone,  but not the iPad. Not much good it does to plan a trip on the iPad when you cannot shop for flights.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-22 5
You will need it for sure when you are on vecation
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-21 1
And update was indicated. It's now been "installing" on my iPhone for the last 3-4 days & I can't stop it. Maybe someday. Annoying.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-21 5
It is much faster to complete bookings with this app than the pc....
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-21 2
Mostly useless without the ability to book flights
Version 1.5 2013-04-21 1
Can't make flight reservations. What is possibly the point?
Version 1.6 2013-04-20 5
Thank you, this app rocks! Nothing easier!
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-20 1
Can't books flights on it. Worthless.
Version 2.1 2013-04-20 5
Very impressed with the redesign of their app, this is coming from a software engineer who knows a thing or two about GUIs.  Loved gyroscope
Door hanger thing used as a loading screen, very easy to input billing information and it works exactly as you would expect.  Only suggestion is add a filter by name field or at least a sort by name, had to search by city then find the specific hotel on map rather than by name but not a biggie.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-19 5
Read super accurate reviews and selected two hotels and booked them both, all from my phone.  Awesome app!!!
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-19 5
Itinerary viewer is just so intuitive and (not to mention) beautiful!! 
I look forward to future updates and designs. 
Good job, Expedia
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-18 5
Beautiful app. It's so easy to use, flies seamlessly on my iPhone 5. I love it.
Version 3.0.2 2013-04-18 1
Apparently some of this functionality is available via iPhone/iPod, but not iPad. Until I can book flights, hotels, car rentals, and activities from my iPad, this app isn't much use to me.
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-18 5
After trying several other apps, I settled on this one.
It has become my favorite. Great app!
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-17 1
This app always gives me issues the web site is a lot better
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-16 1
Can't figure out how to search for flights. This app is not user friendly at all!!!
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-16 1
I asked for a hotel based on current location and they gave me location 40 minutes away. Thinking it was close and then booked it. When I realized my error I asked for refund 10 minutes later and the nice folks at Extended Stay America would not refund even a cent.
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-16 3
Please add!! Great otherwise, but I want to use this on my iPad.
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-15 1
Can't find airport based on city name. Stupidest search function ever!
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-14 5
Great app!!
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-14 1
Nice, I can look at Paris hotels. But, no flight info? What?
Version 3.0 2013-04-14 1
Is it me or is this app incapable of booking a simple flight from a city you're not in to another city you're not in? No need to answer, I spent 5 minutes on it before I realized no app has that long a learning curve and will now delete it. 

Another triumph of Marketing people over common sense.
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
I have used this app several times and have never had a problem!!!!
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
Paid 87.00 per night at a Hampton Inn very nice place. Has pool and hot tub!
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 4
BUT !!! 

The itinerary is the best feature but it list trips by locations so when we have 6 different ppl going to the same location it's hard to find your flight. 

Next. Could we please look at the return trip info and details. !! The app shows that u have a trip home but you can't  click to view the details have to log onto the website to see all that info.
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
This app makes reservations as quick and easy as possible. Much more intuitive than Travelocity.
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 1
Why launch an app for the iPad that doesn't search and book flights?  Unless you're looking for an app to book a hotel only...don't waste your time.  Stick to the website.
Version 3.0 2013-04-13 4
I gotta say. I was very excited for the redesign of this app. And it was very well implemented. But a few details could make it an even better app. It has a lot of potential to become the 'must have' for any traveler. 

One feature that would be welcomed is Passbook support. Another would be to see the saved itineraries on your account. And also check points balance. 

Keep up the good work! I'm sure you'll make it even better. :)
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
I book a lot of travel and this app is the best!  So user friendly with great details and pictures to help me make the right hotel choice!  I am super thrilled with this app!
Version 3.0.1 2013-04-13 5
I've reviewed this app a few times but I want to note that this app is getting continuously better. Well made! I'd like to see an "add to maps" and "add to calendar" function one day.
Version 3.0 2013-04-12 1
Poorly organized as there is no option to explore flights. Once you open the app and enter your current location, it automatically takes you to hotels in your area with no (obvious) way of searching for flights. Needs to be fixed. Orbitz, Travelocity and other travel apps have a much easier user face.
Version 3.0 2013-04-12 1
Your new site is very inadequate and lacks old sort capabilities. Very frustrating!
Version 3.0 2013-04-11 5
Great hotel info and lightning hotel and air travel booking!
Version 3.0 2013-04-11 5
This app is flippin FANTASTIC! It's easier to use than the website! LOL!
Version 3.0 2013-04-11 1
You can't look at flights on an iPad which makes this app worthless.
Version 3.0 2013-04-11 5
Lo mejor para planificar un viaje. Mo te complica en nada y es muy intuitivo.
Version 3.0 2013-04-11 4
Pretty good
Version 3.0 2013-04-10 1
Won't support flight search on iPad?  DELETE. Back to Travelocity.
Version 3.0 2013-04-10 1
Like another reviewer...no flights...half an app or an use interface so poor we can't find one of two major buttons.  And the annoying swinging door sign...work on functionality, clean and effective not gimmicks!  I am an Expedia VIP ( ie use it a lot) and might use it even more if the App worked.
Version 3.0 2013-04-10 3
I cannot figure out how to access the flight portion. I click on trips and shop but it defaults back to hotels. Please update to fix bug. Thank you
Version 3.0 2013-04-09 4
Love the app, I would like to have a few more options beyond flight and hotel.
Version 3.0 2013-04-09 1
I put my itinerary # in and it keeps saying they can't find anything.. What's up with that? I wanted to look it up just out of curiosity. I'm not to sure about this app.
Version 3.0 2013-04-09 3
Does not allow for multiple destinations on the same trip or arriving and departing from different airports. The controls are not intuitive.
Version 3.0 2013-04-08 5
Excellent app super fast
Version 3.0 2013-04-07 4
Would like to be able to buy multiple rooms in one session
Version 3.0 2013-04-07 1
No flights? I am disappointed...
Version 3.0 2013-04-07 5
I am miffed by the large number of 1 star reviews. Though I do understand the need of 1 stop shop, there is not 1 single hospitality service provider on this planet that knows my preferences and budget. Therefore, transit and stay are 2 components of the travel booking experience that cause friction when joined in one checkout pipeline.

This app, hotel only, should be reviewed as such and and not against a standard that isn't met by anyone on this planet.

For ease of use, visual appeal, fluency and price point I am giving this app 5 stars. Never ever did I experience such a frictionless hotel booking experience. So critical booking elements such as price, selection and ease of use were all met.
Version 3.0 2013-04-07 5
This has made my life soo much easier. Booking travel while running in a treadmill or going through security.... So much nicer than any other travel app! Well done guys! Keep pushing the pretty pixels!
Version 3.0 2013-04-07 1
How can you call this app hotels and flights when a user cannot book a flight.  Worthless app! Uninstalled
Version 3.0 2013-04-07 2
I don't get it. Isn't flight booking is a big part of your business? This app is pretty useless without it. The mobile division of Expedia should have thought about that before releasing the app
Version 3.0 2013-04-06 3
Nice but missing the car rental option
Version 3.0 2013-04-06 3
Missing flight booking. Aside from that it works well and I enjoy the look of my itinerary.
Version 3.0 2013-04-06 1
Where is the flight search option. Stupid app ever.
Version 3.0 2013-04-06 1
What is the point of an Expedia hotel only app? I want flight info!! No thank you for this app.
Version 3.0 2013-04-05 1
Installed this app to save my itinerary in the "trips list." It wasn't able to find my itinerary while I was able to access it on the website. Tried multiple times, still no good outcome. Useless.
Version 3.0 2013-04-05 1
Haven't been able to load one search. Always times out. If I new wireless Internet ill be at my comp...
Version 3.0 2013-04-05 5
Easy and great to use
Version 2.2 2013-04-04 2
Doesn't offer both the hotel & flight unless you go to their website, which I have to do. However it's an okay app for just browsing places.
Version 3.0 2013-04-02 1
Every day (and multiple times daily) i get a notice for updating the app. Each time i hit update, it doesnt work. I've never had an app act so strange
Version 3.0 2013-04-02 1
Just skip and go directly to main website if your looking to bundle your flight and hotel. I can't believe this app doesn't offer that option.
Version 3.0 2013-04-01 1
The whole point of Expedia is to have a one stop shop for flights, hotels, and activities.  I don't just want to see rooms.  Don't bother with this app-just go to their website.
Version 3.0 2013-04-01 1
I have selected a flight, made a wrong choice and can only proceed to checkout?  I can never pick another flight, back to the website.
Version 3.0 2013-03-31 5
Thanks for such wonderful app!!!
Version 3.0 2013-03-31 5
Found a mobile only rate that was cheaper than online and booking over the phone.
Version 3.0 2013-03-31 1
Seriously u can't do both like the regular site. Ill never use this till its fixed.
Version 3.0 2013-03-31 1
On my iPad and can't find flights or packages, only finding hotels.
Version 3.0 2013-03-31 1
crap app what is this junk who the Fu put 4 star? for what?
so ffff app
Version 3.0 2013-03-30 1
I am in Brazil and the app doesn't allow me to login into my US account. #fail

Also when I tried to access the app page on App Store they redirected me to iTunes. #fail
Version 3.0 2013-03-30 5
I almost want to book hotels by just using this app. Amazing and smart user interface, very Applelesk, very clean and to the point. Great job guys!
Version 3.0 2013-03-30 1
Like other reviewers, I can't see how to search for flights.
Version 3.0 2013-03-30 5
This is now the best travel related app. Each update has improved its usefulness, and it is beautifully designed. Keep it up!
Version 3.0 2013-03-30 1
Is it just me who can't seem to locate the flight search within this app? I'm on iPad, and that flight search is supposed to work as advertised. Leaving out that essential feature while avertising it as a flight search app is unacceptable!
Version 3.0 2013-03-30 1
I updated the app and it does not work anymore
Version 3.0 2013-03-29 1
One star for not able to search for flight even after updates!  This app should not feature flight search if Expedia is not ready to offer it on iPhone.  Considering its rivals all have apps supporting flight, hotel and rental car searches, there is no excuse for the mishap!
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 5
Needed a place to stay the night before we go back home and was close to the airport. 5 minutes! This place was clean and comfortable.  Friendly staff as well.  I would recommend and would come back again :)
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 2
You'll fine better deals at other websites.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 1
Why call it Hotels and Flights if it doesn't do flights?  Wasted my time.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 5
Great for hotel searches! Very user friendly.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 1
I wanted to check on flights, rental cars, etc.  All it would do was hotels.  Meh, not what I wanted.  There was a SEPARATE app to look at flight arrivals and departures, sized for iPhone not iPad, but it also wouldn't price or book anything.  Overall pretty useless...
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-28 4
Wonderful app for booking hotels. Love the pictures you can view and the map showing where the hotel is located in relation to others. May sort them by rating, popularity, pricing, etc.  
Reviews from patrons may be sorted as well. Wonderful app for hotels only, doesn't really work for flights.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 1
I was looking for a flight and saw one on the app for $95.00. It was the lowest price by far. When I went to buy it, the price jumped to $235.00. I can do better with a browser.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 4
What more can you ask for? A lot!  but I love this app nonetheless!
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 1
Cant search and book any flight!
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 5
Booking hotels was easy for experienced Expedia traveler.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-27 1
All it would do is hotels and nothing else. Unless you are looking for hotel.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 1
Couldn't seem to get out of search for hotels in my backyard. Most useful thing was the link to the website.  
Deleted within a couple of hours, too frustrating.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 1
Despite its name, there's no ability to do a flight search (US)!!
Don't waste your time with this app.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 5
Very well designed.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 5
Fast & Easy. Loved it!
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 2
When looking for flights you can select number of adults, but not children. This is a major over site. This ap is therefore useless and will be deleted
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-26 1
Would give it no stars if that was an option. come on.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-16 5
Easy to use, looks good, too.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-14 5
Thank you so much for a painless way to save money in a last minute night. We were switching hotels after an unpleasant first night and Expedia came through with a high end Vegas hotel. A seemless check in too. 
Great flexible cancellation policy too.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-14 2
The app does not allow to book flights. Why is the word "flights" in the name????
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-13 5
Fast and easy to use. Just used it to book an AC trip. Fast updates and great competitive prices!
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-13 4
Once you figure out the non-intuitive interface.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-13 5
Very clean UI. Pleasant to use.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-13 5
Just booked my hotel with it for our Hawaii trip!
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-12 5
Completely saved me from disaster at SXSW.  Thanks Expedia!
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-12 5
This app works great! It's fast and visually slick. Thanks for a great experience.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 2
When this option will be available, ill review it again
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 5
It's nice application easy to use. Thank you Expedia team for your  support and help to make my vacations true all the time and each time is much better than last one.

Only one suggestion please ask the hotel to take full pictures from all angles or using panorama style.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 2
The loading time on the flight search is much too long! I enjoy the interactive download screen with the passenger window, but it does not make up for the amount of time spent just trying to search for flights.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 2
It doesn't let you choose round trip. :/ fix it please
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-11 4
I've compared with other companies, simultaneously searching for best price and found equal or better deals with Expedia even when looking for last minute flights.  Had difficulty years ago, yet it keeps getting easier.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-10 5
It is fast and easy... Always use thi app and find the best prices
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-09 5
We read all of the reviews prior to booking out trip to Kona
Let me be honest....you should take reviews as nothing but gossip
The Hilton Waikoloa Resort is beautiful!
Some reviews tell of the annoying birds...REALLY?  They have 40 varieties of birds and animals on a 35 acre resort
The Minah birds announce sunrise & sunset enthusiastically everyday
It is part of the wonderful nature in Hawaii   If you didn't like them then stay home and listen to the sounds of your neighborhood!?# whats more annoying are the rude people and loud and unruly kids!
The resort has something for everyone a magnificent lagoon with beautiful fish and turtles to snorkle within a safe environment!
And the person who complained that none of the rooms could see the ocean!  They could not have been more wrong!
If you want oceanFRONT then pay for it! It is a open beautiful view of the ocean and many whales with nothing between you but a little grass and a few palms!   There are also partial ocean, lagoon, and garden views available 
Don't believe everything you read on the internet! It is a gorgeous resort with wonderful amenities and employees!
It is a Hilton    It is Hawaii   How can you go wrong?
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-09 4
Saved an extra 30% on hotel using mobile app
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-08 5
An awesome app. Its so useful and so easy to use. really a good job!!!
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-07 4
All aspects are easy to use, the final checkout is a bit confusing, you have to have every single field filled out to finish and pay, but it does not tell you where the errors are. You'll figure it out pretty quick though. Great deals and selection...integrates with their website and your online profile.
Version 2.3 2013-03-06 5
Only used it once to actually book a hotel, but have researched various hotels, flights, and locations using this app. So far, I love it. Very easy to use. Lets you put in the exact location. Of where you're going to be and let's you find hotels nearby. Have compared the prices here to other apps and they truly are one of the lowest. Would def recommend!
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-05 1
Put my dates of travel in, picked my room, confirmed purchase and it switched my dates of travel to that day.....had to spend over a hour with Expedia trying to get my money back
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-04 2
It doesn't let you review hotels, only allows reading of other reviews. Why is this most basic functionality not present? Because they rushed it onto the App Store without usability testing.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-04 1
This is not an app; it's a crapp (clever, eh?). Does not let you book flights. Good thing I only downloaded this to get nano pods on Battle Nations.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-03 5
Does everything it's supposed to do, in style. Fantastic. 

Of course, Expedia deals are really nice too. :)
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-02 1
No flight search capability
Version 2.3 2013-03-01 3
It's easy to use. App design looks nice and pretty. Should automatic update itinerary to TripaAssist.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-01 1
How can you guys not have flight and hotel packages? This is a huge disappointment. I almost booked a hotel with no flight. They should be more clear with this.
Version 2.3.1 2013-03-01 1
Flight search does not work! The "Search Error" appears with the message "The operation couldn`t be completed. (MOErrorDomain Error 5.)".
The app is now completely useless!
Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 1
There's not a way to check flight prices? Useless.
Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 1
You would expect that an app that says hotels and FLIGHTS would be able to supply both. I downloaded the app thinking I'd be able to find something. After painfully trying to figure it out, I went on a google search only to find out that it's something they don't have now but hope to have in the future. Despite the fact that in their update they stated you can "book a flight to anywhere in the world." Either fix they need to fix this soon or they should in the least stop misleading people and just say this a way to search for Hotels only by changing the name. As far as I'm concerned, this app is worthless!
Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 3
Great app except for it keeps freezing.
Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 1
I'm living in Tokyo and I can't even search flights via the app because its not available in my location -_- I can with Travelocity...
Version 2.3.1 2013-02-28 2
It would be nice to be able to change search locations from the map.  Alternately or in addition- it would be nice to be able set the search radius. 

Also does not show very many search results.
Version 2.3 2013-02-27 2
....
Version 2.3 2013-02-26 5
App is very easy to use.  Wish I could book multiple rooms at the same property at the same time.
Version 2.3 2013-02-26 5
Just used the app to book a spring break hotel in Miami. Super easy to use, a monkey could do it.
Version 2.3 2013-02-26 1
Book a flight? But not on the ipad... Useless
Version 2.3 2013-02-25 1
Expedia sent me to a hotel with a bad reservation. I wasn't able to stay at the hotel and Expedia still is trying to charge my account. The prices shown in the app aren't true to the real price and change after the reservation. Expedia is a scam!
Version 2.3 2013-02-25 2
what's missing from this app is a car rental icon so we can book a car rental.
Version 2.3 2013-02-25 1
Cannot find flight search. Really poor app.
Version 2.3 2013-02-24 5
Very easy and helpful to find hotels in small towns.
Version 2.2 2013-02-23 1
I only fly first and business, this app is unusable for me...
Version 2.3 2013-02-23 5
Live in Maine, travel south often.  This is the go-to site when looking for reservations!
Version 2.3 2013-02-22 1
What's the point of the aircraft logo AND the name without being able to search flights??? Idiotic app!
Version 2.3 2013-02-22 1
Where are the flights?!!
Version 2.3 2013-02-21 3
Why would you call an app Expedia Hotels and Flights if you cannot book flights.  It did a good job for a mobile app to help me find, choose and book a hotel, even let me log in with my Expedia credentials.  But there is no way to find or book a flight.  Either fix it or rename the app.  Rookie move.
Version 2.3 2013-02-21 1
Someone goofed big! Can't get flights! Unusable!
Version 2.3 2013-02-21 1
None of the functionality of the website. You can't even log into your Expedia account. You can't book flights. A laughable app in this day and age.
Version 2.2 2013-02-21 2
This app provides little functionality compared to their website. You can do simple searches but not robust or detailed ones. And there is no place to put your account info to save your information, trips, etc. If you book on their website, you won't be able to pull the trip up in this app. Needs work.
Version 2.2 2013-02-20 1
Can only book hotels.  Lame!
Version 2.2 2013-02-20 5
Great app
Version 2.2 2013-02-20 1
Have been using Expedia for over a decade and was a great fan. Recently booked a room in Naples for $90 or so with it and was very happy.
Downloaded the app, and was quoted the same on Expedia web today, yet $180 on the app for same room!
Hasta la Vista...
Downloading Yayak now
Version 2.2 2013-02-20 5
Awesome app!!!
Version 2.2 2013-02-20 1
This app is terrible. You can only book trips for a single person... who goes on vacation alone?
Version 2.2 2013-02-19 3
Worth looking at to get an idea of what hotels are around, wished they et al. would have a pet friendly search option, as is, can not use since we travel with 2 dogs.
Version 2.2 2013-02-19 1
I never leave a review and this app is so bad I must.  Nothing more than one log advertisement.  Not usable.  No access to my itineraries.   Just plain bad.
Version 2.2 2013-02-18 1
I love Expedia and have used them for YEARS.  I was excited to get the app since i use the site so much but found prices on the app and the prices on the website were so different. The app quoted almost $100 more than the website!  Old school shopping for me.
Version 2.0 2013-02-18 5
Very easy to use - all the important stuff: location, reviews, price
Version 2.2 2013-02-17 5
It looks great and works really well.
Version 2.2 2013-02-17 4
Not sure why so many people gave this such bad reviews, saying they couldn't book flights/round trips. Perhaps there's been an update in the past coupe of days since they wrote those reviews (or perhaps those people are a bit slow....in which case I guess the app needs some improvements to make it easier for *everyone* to use).
Personally I found it very easy to use, the interface was great, especially compared to using the website on my phone. I'd give it 5 stars, except there doesn't seem to be a way to book a flight for more than one person at a time - I looked everywhere. Perhaps I'm slow too?
Version 2.2 2013-02-17 1
Just awful.  You can't even book flights or more than one night in a hotel.
Version 2.1 2013-02-16 1
Why no flights? There are only hotels...
Version 2.2 2013-02-16 1
Am I the only one who couldn't get a price on round trip just 1 way? Also could not find choices to pick first class, direct flights or time of day preferred to fly.
Version 2.2 2013-02-16 5
Great app!!!
Version 2.2 2013-02-15 1
Offered 10% discount for hotels if I use mobile app. The coupon didn't work. Deleted the app, will never use Expedia, booked through kayak
Version 2.2 2013-02-15 5
Easy to use. Comprehensive. Best price guarantee! What else do you need?
Version 2.2 2013-02-15 5
So quick and easy to use!  Saved us 40% on our first stay!  Thanks
Version 2.2 2013-02-14 4
Great app
Version 2.2 2013-02-14 3
Doso
Version 2.2 2013-02-14 2
There's basically nothing here.  Kayak for now!
Version 2.2 2013-02-14 2
Awful interface.
Version 2.2 2013-02-14 5
This app was easy!! It saved me $20 on one night stay. That wasn't including my work discount either. I love how the resorts had all my information n room ready n set for me when I came. I also loved this app because it allowed me to c when I checked in n out. It also showed me discounts around the resort.  U MUST USE THIS APP!!!!! I referred this app to all my family n friends!! :) beat my expectations for sure!! :)
Version 2.2 2013-02-13 4
I downloaded this app, believe or not, from an ad I saw in the accuweather
app. Although this is not a review of the ads, I feel I need to give the Expedia team thumbs up on creativity. The rotating Las Vegas images are awesome!!

Now back to the app itself. The good news: The app is really beautifully assembled and it is very user friendly. The bad news: needs more work for booking flights and general integration with other Expedia properties.

I think there's lots of potential here, though. Good job.
Version 2.2 2013-02-13 1
How can a hotel&flight app without flight searching faction?!
Version 2.2 2013-02-13 2
One star because it is the minimum and one because it is free so I don't feel cheated by deleting it.
Version 2.2 2013-02-05 1
What's the point of an Expedia app that doesn't let you see your Expedia account?  I'm deleting.
Version 2.2 2013-02-04 1
I am really getting concerned about the terrible apps that make it though the review process in Apple's App Store. This should have been rejected simply because it does nothing but show you where you are. Totally worthless and false advertising at that. Good thing I didn't have to pay because its going right to the trash.
I would much rather write a very positive review but my last two reviews have been negative because of crap like this. How is Apple approving these apps that don't work?
Version 2.2 2013-02-04 1
As an Elite member of Expedia I have no idea why Expedia would release such a useless app.
Version 2.2 2013-02-03 1
No flights
Version 2.2 2013-02-03 1
The app and Expedia will spoil your dream vacation. Stay away from Expedia. Just booked a hotel at Key largo and called the hotel a day after. It was not booked! It's been two days now and they always say wait for another day to fix it! Save your sanity and stay away!!!
Version 2.2 2013-02-02 1
Deleting, no flights just hotels
Version 2.2 2013-02-02 1
The app only lets me see hotels no Airlines.
Version 2.2 2013-02-01 2
Not very useful
Version 2.2 2013-02-01 1
Why I can't book flights for 3 people together.
Version 2.2 2013-02-01 1
I guess it is hotels only. False advertising. DELETED!
Version 2.2 2013-02-01 4
Really easy to use and very helpful while travelling
Version 2.2 2013-01-31 4
Started to do comparison between computer rates and this ap on the phone.  Never got to compare, this ap found a room in the right spot for a good price , so I took it.
Version 2.2 2013-01-31 3
Still waiting for the flight app.
Hotel only is not useful to me because I book flight, hotel and car all in one.
Please offer it soon.
Version 2.2 2013-01-31 1
I can't find the flights in the "Expedia Hotels & Flights" app.
Version 2.2 2013-01-31 5
Easy to use
Version 2.2 2013-01-31 2
The prices do not match the websites prices for flights , not accurate, needs to be updated some more to reflect expedias website , it doesn't show the lowest price flights that are offered on the website and it also does not show all available flight options. I would rather browse on the website from my phone then use this app
Version 2.2 2013-01-30 1
Cant add a second traveler!!!!! WASTE OF TIME
Version 2.2 2013-01-30 1
I wasted an hour on the Expedia app trying to increase travelers from 1 to 2 yesterday after finding the deal I liked. I am a dad of 4 with already thin time margins, so it really tapped me. Then I finally googled an admittance by Mobiata, the Expedia app creator, that increasing travelers was a "feature" not yet included in this version of the app. Expedia has lost my trust.
Version 2.2 2013-01-30 1
The app is named hotels and flights, but currently offers only hotel booking for the iPad version. Why use this app when I can just go to the website and book flights, hotels and cars??? What's the point? Come on Expedia, really? Is this your best?
App deleted.
Version 2.2 2013-01-30 2
Can't look for deals or flight and hotel packages so not useful for me. Also difficult to navigate unless just looking for hotel or a flight.
Version 2.2 2013-01-30 1
If you want to search hotels, then get it. 
FLIGHTS, totally useless
Version 2.2 2013-01-30 5
While PCSing (doing a military move) from VA to TX we needed hotels to stay at and not knowing some of the areas that we were traveling in, this App is awesome! Really easy to use and I love the checkout process! So easy and thought out. I can have my Expedia Rewards added as well to gain points as I book. I also needed a flight back from TX to VA and could do that all on the same App! 

Only negative is that Expedia needs to find a way to do flights on the App on the iPad. At this time you can only do flights and hotel on the App on the iPhone! Other than that I like it! :)
Version 2.1 2013-01-28 1
If I could rate them negative stars, I would. I Booked a trip back in May of 2012 through Expedia. It was a hotel plus car package. Turns out Expedia never paid for the car rental even though I paid Expedia. I started to receive letters and collection calls from the car rental place wanting me to pay them. When I asked why this wasn't being handled through Expedia, they told me Expedia was refusing to pay. I honestly cannot believe a big corporation would do something like this and I cannot believe that it's almost a year later and I'm still trying to resolve the issue. Thanks a lot Expedia. Bookers BEWARE!
Version 2.2 2013-01-28 5
It's one of the most funnest app to use. It's simple, interactive and creative. Will continue to use for my travel bookings.
Version 2.2 2013-01-28 1
I've been screwing around with this for ten minutes, and I still can't figure out how to search flights instead of hotels.  Ridiculous.  Don't waste your time.  Would give it zero stars if that was possible.
Version 2.2 2013-01-27 3
The search for a hotel was super easy and very thorough. However, figuring up how to set up an account was not easy at all! I had to go to the website to figure it out. Then go back to the app to book the hotel.
Version 2.2 2013-01-26 5
I love this app!!!
Version 2.2 2013-01-26 2
I can only book one ticket at a time? This is next to worthless. Only good for answering the question of what the price range I could expect is. Would never use this to actually book a flight.
Version 2.2 2013-01-26 1
Downloaded and deleted within 5 min. Can't search flights it gives error.
Version 2.2 2013-01-26 1
I have an iPhone and have never had a problem downloading an app before. This app installs 1/2 way but then gets locked up (installation never completes).
Version 2.2 2013-01-26 1
Ridiculous that we can't see or book flights on this app.
Version 2.2 2013-01-25 1
What's the point of calling it "Fights & Hotels" if you can't book a flight on the iPad version?!
Version 2.1 2013-01-25 5
Great app to use for traveling. Although I don't travel very often I still find it very helpful when I need it.
Version 2.2 2013-01-25 1
I always check my own city to see how a travel app works. This app produced dismal results for an area with at least three excellent hotels. It was all hotels that had obviously paid to be recommended. Not at all useful. And I am a rewards member!  Deleted it
Version 2.2 2013-01-25 5
I messed up on my reservation, I called them and they had the change reservation fees waived.  Saved me money and they were extremely helpful.  Great app.
Version 2.1 2013-01-25 1
Deceiving... Only hotel info no flights. :(
Version 2.1 2013-01-25 1
Seems the company only cares about the bottom line. After booking into a hotel that only had two rooms left and both of them set to 52 degrees F. I could not remain there. Outside temp was 32 degrees F and falling. 

Expedia refuse to refund me. Use Travelocity or any other company instead.
Version 2.1 2013-01-25 2
I get info to book hotel, but can't find how to look at flights.  Frustrating!!!!
Version 2.1 2013-01-25 1
Seriously. The flight options only include one way, not round-trip.
Version 2.1 2013-01-24 5
I don't travel much anymore compared to what I used to.  However, using this app on are cent trip to Montana and back to Birmingham has been a treat. As it is able to help me find hotels in the area and price range I wanted and then book it online so I know that I have room confirmed for the evening and the address I can input into my GPS and go straight there makes me wish that it had been available when I travelled more.  BTW, each time I arrived my information was already there and my room keys waiting for me making checking in very easy.
Version 2.1 2013-01-23 5
Worked flawlessly and gave great info. Whoever developed this should be given a big raise.
Version 2.1 2013-01-22 1
For some reason, this app claims to have the ability to lookup flights but the developers forgot to include that functionality.  

Running on an iPad and I can't find anything like a 'main screen' where I can search for a flight.  Seems to be stuck in hotel mode.
Version 2.1 2013-01-21 1
If you want irrelevant notices pinned to you smartphone screen, with no way to delete them, this is the app for you!
Version 2.1 2013-01-20 4
The app is awesome! It should have a way to save the hotels you like for future searches...
Version 2.1 2013-01-20 4
Clean, easy to use
Version 2.1 2013-01-20 3
When will we be able to book flights?  Nice app, but why leave the main part out...doesn't make sense.
Version 2.1 2013-01-20 5
worked great. found cheaper hotel price than any other sight and I looked at a lot of sights. forget kayak.
Version 2.1 2013-01-20 3
Can't add more then one passenger for some reason. Frustrating.
Version 2.1 2013-01-19 4
Gorgeous app. Really easy to and just beautiful.
Version 2.1 2013-01-19 1
App is easy to use, but when trying to search for a flight the only options are for departure and arrival airport and dates. Not able to say dates are flexible...
Version 2.1 2013-01-11 5
Have only used it once so far, but was super easy to use and very user friendly.
Version 2.1 2013-01-10 5
This app was a breeze to use. Wow!
Version 2.1 2013-01-10 2
This app was not helpful.
Version 2.1 2013-01-09 5
I have always used Expedia for a great deal of my travels. The newly designed app for my droid and my iPad is so easy to use and I really like the layout. It just motivates me to use it more. It's so quick and easy. If you don't use the app, you're missing out.
Version 2.1 2013-01-09 4
There are so many reviews stating that this app only offers hotels and not flights. If that were the case, it's not a problem for me because I drive a few hours to my home away from home, San Francisco. But, I'm confused because on the main menu page it shows at the top "Hotels" on the left,"FLIGHTS" on the right. Very easy to see. The website doesn't feature the hotel+flights+rental option. So, if you use that option frequently, this app won't be satisfactory. But, it moves more smoothly than compared to the internet site on my iPhone and I've had no problems with it. If you're debating whether to download it, it's free, and if you don't like it you can always delete it.
Version 2.1 2013-01-08 1
The app has cool animation features but I was hoping I would have access to my Expedia itineraries and/or could tie together my complete travel plans even if I did not purchase via Expedia. 

I'll be deleting the app since I would rather use the kayak app to search for flights, hotels, etc
Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
I am mystified why this was released with no flight functionality. Completely useless to me, as I rarely stay in hotels. And with no explanation of this, I spent long minutes staring at the app, trying to unlock the secret room that would allow me to search for flights. This would be like downloading a Yahoo Email app and then having it only let you look at Flickr pictures.
Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
Crap, just use Safari. No flight search (or booking), and I only need flights, not hotels.
Version 2.1 2013-01-07 5
Nice clean room for an xlnt price. Staff service very good.
Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
Can I give this zero stars?
Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
Change the misleading name, to Expedia Hotels, since it has nothing to do with flights.
Version 2.1 2013-01-07 1
It's well design with effects and stuff, but doesn't even offer the basics from the website, like combining flight+hotel+car (actually it doesn't even offer car rental at all), and believe it or not this app won't even allow you to book a flight for 2 persons, you gotta buy 2 separate tickets. Get it together Expedia, I decided to buy my package through Orbitz since you can't deliver...
Version 2.1 2013-01-06 2
I first purchased the app for the iPhone then added it to my iPad for convenience. This app is great for booking hotels. Simple easy to use and easy to understand. Where it falls short is in booking flights. The problem is you can't book them. Only with the iPhone app can you book flights. The app icon clearly indicates that flight booking is available within the app and Expedia is known for booking flights. Though this is not the case. I recommend if you want to book a flight via Expedia on your iPad use Safari instead of the Expedia app.
Version 2.1 2013-01-05 5
Did a bunch of research on different hotels that was easy, fast, and had all the information I needed. Also booked a hotel and it was very simple and fast. Great app!
Version 2.1 2013-01-05 5
Used the app on my phone to book a hotel and flight for a weekend getaway in seconds! Great mobile deals on hotels in Vegas!
Version 2.1 2013-01-04 1
It's called "Expedia Hotels & Fights."

But it only has hotels. And I only need flights.

Words fail.
Version 2.1 2013-01-04 2
Pretty ridiculous that you can't book for multiple people as well as your flight and hotel together. Although I'm seeing flights, I can only book one way tickets??  The fact that it looks good is the only good thing this app has going for it unless you're only flying one way or just looking for a hotel.
Version 2.1 2013-01-04 5
Booked a perfect three person room in Florence, Italy in less than five minutes. Easy payment entry and booking. Would recommend to anyone.
Version 2.1 2013-01-04 1
No multi city option, no flight and hotel option. Just use safari.
Version 2.1 2013-01-04 1
Really shocked to see that the application cannot book flights for multiple persons. I tried to book flights for my wife and my 6 year old but can only do one person at a time. So I booked my wife's ticket first and tried to book my son's. But the app won't let me because my son is not 18 yet. I had to call Expedia to rebook everything. What a waste of time.
Version 2.1 2013-01-04 1
There is no capability to search for flights!?!
Version 2.1 2013-01-03 5
my favorite booking app , but need to add social network & email to share .
Version 2.1 2013-01-03 4
World like a gem!
Version 2.1 2013-01-03 3
Not sure about other reviews - looks like it finds flights to me
Version 2.1 2013-01-03 3
Last night my girlfriend and I traveled to Boston and asked for a room at last minute via mobile advertising, we didn't know we had to make a deposit otherwise we couldn't stay there. The room was very clean and quiet. We liked the place, very nice. We'll go back soon.
Version 2.1 2012-12-27 1
Can't book or look up flights. Why bother putting this piece of crap out to the public
Version 2.1 2012-12-27 1
Why can't you select packages on the app? I can't even change the number of travellers. I would not install this app again as it is not very user friendly.
Version 2.1 2012-12-26 5
Easy to use!
Version 2.1 2012-12-26 1
Great Hotel app for the iPad. No flight app for the iPad. Note hotel and flight on iPhone.  Missed the mark on iPad.
Version 2.1 2012-12-26 2
Apps looks great, but there is only one very bad problem, there is no way to book flights. Nice omission Expedia!
Version 2.1 2012-12-26 5
Extremely easy and very user friendly
Version 2.1 2012-12-26 1
Expedia is about to lose my business. Can never check out with either of my saved credit cards. Have had to either call or pay full price. Very inconvenient while on the road. Expedia customer service is too gabby for my taste. Should learn the art of being succinct. That's why I would prefer to book via smart phone.
Version 2.1 2012-12-26 2
If this is called hotels & FLIGHTS, why is there no place to look up flights?
Version 2.1 2012-12-25 1
How about package deals that include both hotel and air?
Version 2.1 2012-12-25 5
Brilliant app. Great work. Fantastic user experience.
Version 2.1 2012-12-24 5
Ridiculously Easy! I love this app for booking stays. Easy easy easy!
Version 2.1 2012-12-24 4
This app works great for hotel reservations.  Easy to search, easy to look at maps for location details, and fast.  I made a hotel reservation in about 3 minutes.  A nice timesaver.
Version 2.1 2012-12-24 1
I downloaded this app to look up flights and I can't see any flight information only hotels. Get it together Expedia
Version 2.1 2012-12-24 1
Too complicated, doesn't give enough info about flight details also how to select more than 1 passenger?
Version 2.1 2012-12-23 5
The interface is easy to use for booking the hotel. Passbook integration is super nice!
Version 2.1 2012-12-23 1
This is ridiculous. There is no way to look up flights. Terrible interface. Once you are in the hotel lookup, it's impossible to figure out how to look up flights. F-, poooooor design.
Version 2.1 2012-12-23 1
Difficult to use and not even possible to book flights.
Version 2.1 2012-12-22 1
Are u kidding??  You can't even look up flights on an App for hotels and flights.  Nice work.
Version 2.1 2012-12-21 5
Fast, straight forward and simple. Works for me.
Version 2.1 2012-12-21 1
You can't book for multiple people.

Love it. One of the most dynamic and user friendly travel apps ever. The only thing missing is access to itinerary & purchase history info.
Version 2.0 2012-12-19 5
Very user friendly, one of the best apps ever.
Version 2.0 2012-12-18 5
This was faster and easier than the website. Thank you Steve jobs. Thank you expedia.
Version 2.0 2012-12-18 5
Good and easy app
Version 2.0 2012-12-17 5
I'm happier with this app than I thought I'd be. I'm on a cross country road trip and just booking hotels as I travel based on how far I feel like going each day. This app has made it super easy!
Version 2.0 2012-12-17 5
This app is excellent. We have been waiting for too long for a good Expedia app and this is it. Amazing!
Version 2.0 2012-12-16 3
App made booking a hotel extremely easy & received Best Price Available! THANK YOU for taking the worry out of travel. One less thing to stress over during the Holidays!
Version 2.0 2012-12-16 1

The flight search is great, except I want to book a flight for me and my wife (2 travelers) and there is no capability to book a multiple traveler trip.
Version 2.0 2012-12-13 1
The Expedia site keeps telling me I'm not choosing in between the proper dates and now I can't a flight because the app flight schedules either....how stupid is that?
Version 2.0 2012-12-13 5
Very easy, straightforward and good deals
Version 2.0 2012-12-12 5

Says it is for hotels and flights... No flight capability. Grrrr.
Version 2.0 2012-12-12 5
Awesome app... Never use anything else to book travel. Easy to use and always has the best deals.
Version 2.0 2012-12-12 4
Great app. Easy to use. Round trips are available despite what people say, but it's hard to see. Upgrade I would suggest is having a place to view all your itineraries
Version 2.0 2012-12-11 5
everything about this app is brilliant - the windows, backgrounds of the city you search for, easy-to-use interface and so much small details! 
you should check this app even if you don't really wanna buy a ticket.
Version 2.0 2012-12-11 1
App opens up ready to search for a hotel but there is no way to search for a flight.
Version 2.0 2012-12-11 5
not bad really helped on my vacation!
Version 2.0 2012-12-10 1
No round trip for the flights, I hope it's gonna be better
Version 2.0 2012-12-10 5
This new app is great, very easy to book hotels!

Booked a hotel and checked-in 10 minutes later!  So easy and so awesome!
Version 2.0 2012-12-10 1
I just did a hotel only search and could get "no results" for Seattle San Francisco and new York city. Messed up.
Version 2.0 2012-12-09 1
I don't see any way of booking flights, just hotels.  I'd like to see the ability to book flights, hotels and cars all in the same place and at the same time on my iPad.  Until then I guess I'll stick to my computer.  :-(
Version 2.0 2012-12-09 4
This app is more useful that Expedia website. User friendly
Version 2.0 2012-12-08 5
Love this App!! Easy to use and compatible with passbook!!
Version 2.0 2012-12-08 1
The iPad version is fairly useless - doesn't do much except for some pretty col animation. Stick to the web site
Version 2.0 2012-12-08 4
Excellent app.  Intuitive and simple.  Does the job with minimum hassle.
Version 2.0 2012-12-08 5
Wish had more hotel options only.
Version 2.0 2012-12-08 4
I like it.
Version 2.0 2012-12-07 1
The app only shows the hotel search page, not the flights, and I can't log in to my account. There doesn't appear to be a main menu to select from on the iPad version.
Version 2.0 2012-12-07 5
Great app reservation done in munutes
Version 2.0 2012-12-06 5
Very helpful for my vacation to the Florida Keys.
Version 2.0 2012-12-06 5
Reserving is easy. Only problem is that you can't add spa packages from what I saw, but that can be added later.
Version 2.0 2012-12-06 2
This app has the greatest UI for booking flights that I have ever seen. Unfortunately I can't use it as I usually need to add a rental car to my booking. Please add packages !!!!
Version 2.0 2012-12-06 4
It works! That's all ya need to know when you're on the road an need a room like we did. A little thin on content. That's why only 4 stars. Keep up the good work! Thanks.
Version 2.0 2012-12-05 5
Nice app. It's flawless. Full descriptions of the hotels we were considering were at our finger tips. Nice crisp clear photos of the properties. We booked two rooms it took less than 5 minutes.
Version 2.0 2012-12-05 3
Can anybody tell me how to search multi city flights? Thanks!
Version 2.0 2012-12-05 4
Need a space to add special requests on booking (hotels). Need option to sorting results by price high to low, AND low to high...same with ratings.
Version 2.0 2012-12-03 3
Hm
Version 2.0 2012-12-03 5
I was stuck at CDG in Paris - within 2 mins of downloading the app, I had found the best rate, booked and paid for room.  Effortless process
Version 2.0 2012-12-03 4
Only used for hotels good location based and deal based choices, like the layout
Version 2.0 2012-12-03 1
No airport code cross reference?  What a joke.  So you expect me to Google airport codes and then go back into your worthless app?  Joke.
Version 2.0 2012-12-02 2
This app will not show the flight menu in your iPad. Will show only hotels.
Version 2.0 2012-12-01 5
Not only is it fun and pretty, but you can book right from the app!!!  Great work!
Version 2.0 2012-12-01 2
Did Expedia really release an app that doesn't allow you to search for flights by class, non-stop or airline? Is this really Expedia?
Version 2.0 2012-11-30 5
I already love Expedia online but once I got my iPhone I'm now hooked to this app when I travel. Combine it with passbook and google maps and its all I need for the perfect vacation planner!
Version 2.0 2012-11-29 5
Excelente app para reserva de hoteles. Me fue bien con las reservas en Argentina y el exterior.
Version 2.0 2012-11-29 1
I don't know why they advertise you can use this to book flights. It's for hotels only.
Version 2.0 2012-11-29 1
App is showing hotels only and no flight options!

Version 2.0 2012-11-17 5
Awesome new UI and simplified UX. Love this app update!
Version 2.0 2012-11-17 1
I downloaded the new Expedia app and attempted to book a flight for my husband and I on my iPad, but the option was not available. Next, I went to book the flights on my phone, but I wasn't able to book a flight for two at the same time. Being able to book for more than one person at a time seems like basic functionality. Back to the drawing board, Expedia. 

I ended up booking the flights using the Orbitz app. I was able to book both flights at once. I also received a coupon code for 15% off of my hotel booking. Win, win Orbitz!
Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
Good UX, straight to the point
Version 2.0 2012-11-16 1
The iPad version seems to only let you book hotels.  Useless, because I only use Expedia for flights.  Correct me if I'm wrong?
Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
Everything is so smooth and beautiful. They really kicked it up a notch.
Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
So,so easy, I should have used it before now!!!
Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
I love that it downloads all of the hotels at once. It makes searchin so much faster.  I travel 2 times a month and this saves me loads of time when I have to make last minute reservations on the go.
Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
Wish all developers pay more attention to App icon, because its gonna hang there on our home screen for a while, so make it worth it , beautiful and realistic! 

-Travel Application must all follow a Pattern so we can have a wonderful Travel page on our home screen that we are proud to show off to everyone
  +like the suit case ( you used)
  +a Ticket Maybe
  +Airplane (3D-like) or just fin 
  +Pilot hat (popping out like if it is really there on the home scree!)

Version 2.0 2012-11-16 5
This app is visually stunning. Everything about the design makes you excited to travel - even the loading page! It runs smoothly, and is a joy to use.
Version 2.0 2012-11-16 1
Can't search for flights on iPad; can't sign in to my Expedia info. Useless until they come out with an iPad app.  Deleted it.
Version 1.5 2012-11-16 1
Next time I will called hotel directly so I knows my room is on bottom floor. Also front desk clerk gave me free upgrade. Front desk clerk told me that most hotels would match all online rates if you call hotels directly and may also give free upgrade or promotional rate better than online rates. It's better to give a try calling hotels directly before making reservations online.
Version 2.0 2012-11-15 5
I really can't quite believe how beautiful and functional this app is. Truly amazing and a must for everyone who is on the road a lot to add to their phone.
Version 2.0 2012-11-15 5
Best travel booking app ever!!! The flight layover bar is so easy and visually appealing!
Version 2.0 2012-11-15 1
Lots of bugs. Won't pick up my location so I can book a room tonight!
Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
The reverse waterfall home page that shows local hotel deals helped me find a great hotel deal for my road trip to Seattle. And the flights shopping experience is so good. I would recommend to my friends!
Version 2.0 2012-11-14 5
That's the sexiest iPhone app I've used so far. So easy so slick. Must use
Version 1.6 2012-11-04 5
I use this app while I'm on the go. It shows great deals and is very up to date. I like that it shows the hotels in your surrounding area and elsewhere for quick information! Very useful for quick hotel bookings.
Version 1.6 2012-11-04 4
Too easy, no issues here. So far I love it!
Version 1.6 2012-11-02 3

MUST HAVE!!!
Version 1.6 2012-10-29 3
I hope this is a joke. The counter attendant made us wait holding our bags at her check in desk while she smoked a cigarette with another hotel employee outside. After a 6 hour drive in a storm, I would've never expected that the rudeness of this employee would've been the worst part of the drive. Nice location though.
Version 1.6 2012-10-28 1
I paid 180$ for a room using Expedia app. When I got to the hotel the front desk informed me that they only charge 109$ for the room. Very terrible never using them again and would not recommend them to anyone make a couple phone calls save 50-% shame on you Expedia for advertising your self as making good deals and instead marking the price up 100%
Version 1.6 2012-10-26 5
Out of the 3 hotel apps I looked at this was the best design & most importantly best deal & description. I like that there is a link for everything you can think of. Even to do the google map thing where u stand in the middle of the street. Loved it!
Version 1.6 2012-10-26 5
Very well designed!

It was so easy to use. I could find places anywhere and the toggle between the map and hotel info was easy. T didn't have to wait for any pages to load or go back etc. To make reservations I just logged in and my info was already there, easy to edit and book a room. Thanks Expedia !

I always use this app for booking hotels. They usually have the cheapest rates. The pics and reviews really help to know what kind of hotel you're getting. I also like "hotel tonight" app.

Very good, but there's no operation of favorite choices. So I have to remember  the hotels all I selected.
Version 1.5 2012-09-09 5
Enough said.
Version 1.4.1 2012-09-08 5
Easy to use. Use it all the time :)
Version 1.5 2012-09-08 5
This app is amazing. I live in a large metro city and get rooms at 60% off at times. I usually use it once a week.
Version 1.4.1 2012-09-06 5
Great app
Version 1.5 2012-09-06 4
Helpful
Version 1.5 2012-09-06 5
Whether you travel often, or just once in awhile, this app is great. Couldn't be easier to use!
Version 1.5 2012-09-06 4
Very functional app.  Works perfectly.   A street view option on the maps would be nice. Or a way to open the hotel's location on Google Maps.
Version 1.5 2012-09-05 5
Great mobile savings
Version 1.5 2012-09-04 4
Very handy app. I did not find a way to review an existing itinerary, though, without logging into the Expedia site separately.
Version 1.5 2012-09-04 5
Made it very simple to find and book a room... GREAT APP!
Version 1.5 2012-09-04 5
I downloaded the app yesterday and tried it for an upcoming concert. Unfortunately, I did not double check the dates and went along through my day thrilled with the ease of use and availability of the hotel I had chosen. Last night, I received my calendar reminder about my reservation for that day (not Friday as I had planned). I panicked, but easily located the customer service number for Expedia and spoke to Jackie, who was completely wonderful. She called the hotel and cancelled the reservation and convinced them not to charge the standard fee for my mistake.  She was so helpful and even suggested I call the hotel directly to attempt to negotiate a similar rate for the night I had actually planned to be there.  Given the amazing customer service I received, coupled with the amazingly easy to navigate app,  I will be booking on Expedia from now on!  In this computerized age, there is no substitute for companies that still practice exceptional customer service. Bravo Expedia!

This made booking my hotel in Lipari, Italy a breeze.
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-14 5
I was surprised at how quick and easy this app worked to book my Vegas hotel. Plus it had better prices than the Expedia website.
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-14 5
Easier to book a room on this app than from pc at home.
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-11 4
This app is awesome for booking a room. Easy to use, choose dates, locations, number of guests, etc. Has lots of information about each hotel. Highlights deals for you. You can even read the reviews from other guests through the app. 

One area where this app is sorely lacking is the fact that you can't view your itineraries for future trips. It seems to me that this would be an obvious thing to be able to do from the Expedia app!  Huge oversight!!!

Other than that it is a great app if you are just booking a room.
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-11 5
Staying at one hotel here in NY... Not too happy so went to this awesome appt and within minutes I'm book in another. Love it!!!!!!

Version 1.4.1 2012-08-09 5
Found this app via Tapjoy. Great app to make hotel bookings, discover hotels and find deals.  I love it!!
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-09 3
I found no place to enter booking dates.  I found it was for the day I placed the order, but would not have known otherwise.
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-09 5
Only took 5 minutes to book room and that included downloading app.
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-08 5

This is easy to use and I wish they had a flight app as well.
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-06 5
Guy's, you are really the best. Keep going like this. I'm enjoing your services as usual. Thanks
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-06 4
Might even be easier to use than the desktop/laptop
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-06 5
Reached Chicago, had forgot to book a hotel. Search by location - hotels show up - simple credit info form. Bam! Hotel booked. Clean interface is a big plus. Thumbs up to the mobile team at Expedia.
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-05 4
This app showed me a hotel that was not on the other apps. It was a luxury hotel with a Christmas time special. Got a great deal and saved money
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-04 1
All the others review rates high on the level of the app development and easy usage.  I am on the road often and in EVERY CASE the rates were AT LEAST 15 present higher.  I am guessing tat is the commission Expedia profits. If you don't care about your rate and a lazy planner rather than calling the establishments and talking to someone ten this apps for you!
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-04 3
I like it
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-03 5
I use to always check all the sites but Expedia gives the best rates. The app makes it even easier. Booking a hotel has never been so easy and quick!
Version 1.4.1 2012-08-03 5
It's really cool. You can add to calendar which is easier for traveller. First time to write review. How cool is that!

Version 1.4.1 2012-07-31 5
Allow you to find a hotel quickly and easily. Can see the hotels in a map, filter results and book with a click of a button. This app is one more reason I've been an avid user of Expedia for years.
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-30 5
That's great idea to use it
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-30 5

Was very easy to use. Booked my hotel in less than 10 mins!
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-27 1
Deleted this app since all the prices are way up high compared to all other websites!
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-27 5
Expedia always has the best prices by far, and this makes it do easy to take advantage of them!  Extremely user friendly and easy to navigate, this app makes booking much less of a hassle.

This is the best app ever
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-24 5
I like how this presents the hotel choices and I like how it shows a breakdown of your final cost before you book the room.
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-23 4
Very nice app and user friendly.  I like the fact that I can modify search criteria without having to re-enter other data over again.  I would like to be able to edit payments within the app or add and save another card.  I made multiple reservations and was required to re-enter my new info each time.  Fix this and I would give app another star.
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-23 5
Love the look, feel an functionality of this app. Nice work!
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-23 5

The app is easy to navigate & it's map feature helps locate your hotel.
I just reserved a room in Tokyo at a cheaper rate than Expedia offered on their website.
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-21 5
It actually works!!! Love it!!!

Easy to book hotels on my phone!
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-18 4
Useful! I with this app I spend only 5-10 minutes to find and book a room. But would be cool to change currency somehow (or I just didn't find?)
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-17 5
Easy-Peasy and not at all Sleasy
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-17 5

Excellent and easy to set up!
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-16 5
I gotta tell you, for an impromptu trip into New York city, I couldn't have done it without this app! Just go by "popular" selection and it should steer you in the right direction.
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-15 5
Has done well by me worldwide
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-14 5
This app is great for booking a room on the go.  I've used it many times now!
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-13 5
This app is perfect for my use: trying to find last minutes hotels when I am on the road. It allows you to open a map and search for all hotels on the map screen. It puts them on the map with the pins and you can select pins to see prices. You can also view in a sortable list format.

Very easy to book and review hotels.
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-13 5
Works great for bookings!
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-10 5
Better than the actual website!
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-06 5
Very easy and user friendly!. I made the booking even faster than on the website.
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-05 3
love this app
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-05 4
I love Expedia!!!  I have booked over US$50,000 in travel through the web site.

The App is OK, but lacks the review details by "Room Cleanliness", "Service", etc. that I have come to expect.

I found myself checking out the hotels in the website and then booking through the App because that part really is better in the App.

I know they will make it better, I just hope that they do it soon, as I find myself checking Kayak more everyday to search for Air tickets, cars, and hotels.  They should be able to do something like Kayak has done, which is really great...
Version 1.4.1 2012-07-04 1
Price always higher than booking ,, you can check ... There is no customer service in the APP
Version 1.4.1 2012-06-30 3
So we're in the 21st century and this app feels like it was made in the 19th century by a 5 year old. Literally, im into os development myself so I really appreciate good work but this seriously one of the WORST APPS of all time. I say this because Xpedia is a BIG COMPANY how do they come up with this Lolololol? Just use grupon, way better. 
Reason why I'm complaining is that there are virtually no good filtering options, no categories, and getaways within a certain range of your location are limited to 10 miles!!!! Oh and once you find a location that you like YOU CANNOT DIRECTLY ACCESS GOOGLE MAPS THROUGH THIS APP! If that wasnt bad enough, you can't even copy the address location so that you can leave the app and find how to get to your destination. 

Pros (the few): 
Large variety of hotels 
Xpedia does have one cool thing that you use the map to literally find a hotel in the area that you can see.
Version 1.4 2012-06-29 4
Simple fast process.  
Room was $109.00 reg.  paid $85.00
Version 1.4 2012-06-28 1
I was in Punta Cana Dominican Republic on a Wednesday. I booked a hotel in South Beach. For the weekend starting on friday, instead the app booked me for that same night. I'm still in Punta Cana  and Expedia nor Loews in south beach would change nor cancel the reservation and I had to pay for the 300.00 night not the special. Expedia cancel my account, this was the second time i have had a problem with them  I will never use them or their app again !!  Oh and I stopped payment.
Version 1.4 2012-06-28 4
Fast & easy .... Very happy with Expedia.
Version 1.4 2012-06-25 4
Fast booking! Love it!
Version 1.4 2012-06-25 5
This app was very helpful and easy for me, I booked a flight and hotel with any inconvenience I recommend it.
Version 1.0.2 2012-06-23 1
Used this app to book a room at the Luxor in Vegas.  Was charged an extra $20 'resort fee' when I checked in. When I called Expedia I was told that they had used hotels.com to book the room and that I would need to call them to resolve the problem... Huh?? This app is being deleted. From now on I will call the hotel directly.
Version 1.4 2012-06-22 5
Very easy to search and book a room.
Version 1.4 2012-06-21 1
Courtyard Marriott in Sherman Oaks (6.23.12-6.27.12) at Marriott.com is $159 per night.  Same dates are $212 a night on this app.  Need I say more?
Version 1.4 2012-06-21 5
This app is awesome good info and it will save you from surprises.  A must have!
Version 1.4 2012-06-21 4
Very informative. And showed best prices. A little disappointed it couldn't send me a confirmation email for some unknown reason. But otherwise very useful and easy to use
Version 1.4 2012-06-18 4

I've tried seemingly all of the hotel apps out there and this is the best I've found--great UI, easy to use and good prices. Highly recommended
Version 1.4 2012-06-15 5
What a great app! I was able to reserve a room in just minutes!

It's really an excellent app .the low down if we need two or three rooms instead of # of person ..
Version 1.4 2012-06-06 5
Found hotel fast, booking was simple. Great app
Version 1.4 2012-06-05 1
This app is horrible. When picking a date for a trip, it set it back to the day of, meaning instead of getting the date for the weekend it gave the time of purchase. Plus the conformation was never sent. Leave it to Expedia to find a loop hole not to refund this error.
Version 1.4 2012-06-04 5
Needed to book a hotel. Started on the web site from my iPad browser and decided to stop and check if they had an App for that. Sure enough, they did!!! It was so much easier to use than the web site on the iPad.  Booked my hotel faster than ever before...
Version 1.4 2012-06-04 5
Great place to stay at, reasonable prices and great service. Expedia is the best site to use when booking a reservation.
Version 1.4 2012-06-03 4
Very nice.  Easy to use.  Booked a hotel stay in less than 5 minutes.
Version 1.4 2012-06-03 5
Love Expedia and almost always use it when booking for plane/hotel! This app is user friendly and made booking our hotel a synch! By logging into my Expedia account, booking was one-click away! Would def recommend.
Version 1.4 2012-06-02 5
I love this app! It's so easy to use. Yu can search by address, are etc. any way you can on the computer. Once you hit "book" you're booked, no re entering all your info. Quick and easy-just what I like in an app.
Version 1.3.2 2012-05-31 5
Love this app makes traveling a lot easier
Version 1.3.2 2012-05-30 5
Has made my travels and room searches an ease.
Version 1.3.2 2012-05-30 1
Dishonest Expedia agents will push what they tell you is "the last deal available" on what you're looking for, when that is not actually the case. The last one I spoke with was incredibly pushy and outright rude. I don't plan to give Expedia my business any longer. There are too many other companies in this business that don't treat their customers this way.
Version 1.3.2 2012-05-30 5
Easy to maneuver through the site. Was able to hit the "back" button without starting all over. WILL USE APP AGAIN!!!! :)
Version 1.3.2 2012-05-30 1
Very confusing interface.  No obvious way to sign in to an existing expedia account.
Version 1.3.2 2012-05-28 4
Very easy to book a room
Version 1.3.1 2012-04-12 5
Very nice app to find a place to spend the night quick and easy while the wife was driving
Version 1.3.1 2012-04-12 2
Decent app except if you use the guest account to make a reservation but have an Expedia account.  You can't see your hotel information nor link the reservation to your account after the fact.  Not even if you call customer service.  That needs to fixed or at least some kind of warning given.
Version 1.3.1 2012-04-12 1
Went into my room and the toilet was clogged. Asked the front desk manager for a plunger, to which he told me to call back in ten minutes, to which he would be gone for the evening when I did call back in ten minutes. The toilet paper holder kept falling off.
 The remote control to the TV did not work and the bed just had this icky feeling about. I didn't even bother getting under the covers.
Version 1.3.1 2012-04-12 5
Easy, breezy for making reservations on the go. Intuitive as well. Ty

This is a great app. The map function allows for easy area search
Version 1.3.1 2012-04-05 5
Booked a vacation in less than 1 minute!
Version 1.3.1 2012-04-05 1
Wish this app cataloged more info about hotels such as breakfast, pool, and wifi.  Hope they update the app soon so I can book travel using my online Expedia account. Until then it is better to use the web interface or the kayak app so I don't have to enter the same info every time.
Version 1.3 2012-04-03 5
No problems. Easier than the website. 
If I had a comment it would be to add a feature to bookmark hotels as you're making your decisions and sorting out your plans
Version 1.3.1 2012-04-02 4
Good app never have issues with Expedia. I wish they would tell you if the hotel rooms have other things like a jacuzzi. Or a feature that can tell you how close the hotel is to wherever you're going. But overall very useful and they were cheaper than hotels.com
Version 1.3.1 2012-04-02 5
Simple but very useful. Never had booking experience so easy!!!
Version 1.3.1 2012-04-02 5
Best app ever love it
Version 1.3 2012-04-01 1
This app needs to be removed because it fundamentally misrepresents the services being provided.  
It may NOT book you through Expedia even though you sign in to your Expedia account, and receive a confirmation email from Expedia. 
The app may actually book you through Hotels.com-and you will receive no credit from Expedia. 
Expedia representatives will tell you that "app" bookings are handled by another department.  However, there is no other department- only the 1800 780 5733 number which is Hotels.com.
Fake.

I never travel. Expedia made me feel like a pro. I found prices better than expected. Flight and Hotel. Most important, I Can Trust Expedia! Sounds like I work for there marketing department. Lol! I don't. I'm just a garbage man in WA. Thanks Expedia for making my travel plans stress free.
Version 1.3.1 2012-03-31 5
Did it with one thumb. So cool!!!!
Version 1.3.1 2012-03-31 5
Booked perfectly
Version 1.3 2012-03-25 3
Would have gotten 4 stars if I didn't have to create a new email address just to book a room because it didn't like the address from my personal domain.

I am a heavy Expedia user for business travel. This app is useless. 
1.  Cannot log in to your account 
2.  Cannot find hotels out of the country
3.  Cannot book airlines
4.  If you do book, cannot use your frequent flier / hotel loyalty account
5.  Cannot enter corporate discount codes or AAA discount

It is hard to imagine his this app was specified or why even of was produced.
Version 1.3 2012-03-24 3
The app crashes every time I try to view a photo of a room. Very annoying. Please fix it.
Version 1.3 2012-03-23 5
Easy to use with lots of info, like how they show which hotels have deals by the color of the pin
Version 1.3 2012-03-23 1
This does not allow you to sign in with your Expedia profile and it is very easy to make an expensive irreversible mistake while book, poorly designed app
Version 1.3 2012-03-23 4
Fast and easy to book hotel. Only drawback is couldn't enter AAA code.
Version 1.3 2012-03-23 5

That was so easy to use!
Version 1.3 2012-03-20 1
This has most of the basic features you would generally take for granted in a hotel app, but the inability to select the basic room options, like king or double beds, specify non smoking or hypoallergenic requirements or even request additional options like a roll away or request a high or low floor means you might as well just call the hotel where they will ask you these things as standard policy. It's funny that basic features like these were omitted. Beware.
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-20 3
I love using this app and get great prices but I reserved 2 rooms 2 nights and for some reason the hotels got 1 reservation other then that great app
Version 1.3 2012-03-20 1
Watch out for hidden fees!
Got charged almost $20 for services I don't need! They don't specify this in the page!

Worked perfectly!
Version 1.3 2012-03-18 5
I rarely write reviews, but this app was so well thought out I had to mention it. It has great design, extremely fast response and even filled out my booking info from my address app. Wonderful app. Other developers can really learn something from this!

Good hotel app, but I use expedia to bundle that w/ a car and flight typically, which the app doesn't support. I'll use it if I'm lost somewhere and find a wifi connection to get the nearest hotel, but that's it.
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-13 3
My last trip has still not been updated to my Expedia account and for some reason my reward points seem to have disappeared. I'm beginning to loose faith.
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-12 5
As long as you understand the fact that you get what you pay for, this will be the best in its market....
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-11 5
Totally awesome
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-11 2
Compared to the regular website this app is lacking. It will not let you search by address or venue. And when it gives distances it is from city center which in a large city is useless.
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-11 1
I would love this app, except every time I book a hotel, the hotel claims to never have received the reservation and then I end up spending an hour calling the hotel and Expedia/Hotels.com. Ridiculous.
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-10 2
I really did like this app in the beginning but now every time I try using it it'll start and then kick me out another thing I don't like for myself personally is that it doesn't ask for a smoking or non smoking like the website if these were fixed I'd give it a five but since this glitch has been an issue for a bit of time had to give it a 2
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-08 4
Very nicely done. Quick and simple.

Great, easy booking. Love this app!
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-03 1
I usually love Expedia, but this app is awful. 3 times it told me there were problems with my request. I gave up and booked through my comp. Then, 6 hours later, after it's too late to cancel normally, I get 3 email confirmations that my room was booked 3 times. I call Expedia, but after a long time on the phone she tells me these are hotel.com reservations. I tell her that I didn't use hotel.com's ap, I used Expedia's, so they should fix this. Her supervisor had to hear the whole story and he transferred me to another department who had to hear the whole story and tell me she can't help. Call hotels.com. they did help, but it took over another half hours. 90 minutes to cancel reservations I was told were not made successfully by this app, but which actually were, just not via Expedia, and which Expedia help desk can't help on. Why is the app called Expedia?
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-03 1
Have been using this on my iPhone3G for 2 years with great success. But yesterday while booking on my 4S, the app crashed after logging in my credit card. I never got a confirmation # from Expedia, so after deleting, synch & reinstall, could find no record of my reservation going thru. I redid the entire reservation & got a conf email. After we got to the hotel, we found that we had paid for 2 rooms w no refund options. Fortunately, a phone call to Expedia Cancelled the first reservation. Hopefully my credit card will be refunded. The app has since crashed again... So only 1 star for the app for crashing and almost costing me hundreds of $$$ and signif time and phone calls.

Really simple and convenient to search a book a room. New to add functionally to add more than one night.
Version 1.2.2 2012-03-02 5
Literally on the road 2 hrs from our destination and booked with this app in a matter of minutes, thanks!!
Version 1.2.2 2012-02-29 5
After downloading several of the hotel apps and running them side by side my conclusion was this was the easiest to navigate and had the lowest average prices of apps. Credit card information was easy, form auto filled from my personal info on the iPad and just like that my wife and I were booked for 4 nights at the best priced inn/hotel. 

One of the other apps wanted me to sign in or sign up for membership...right one more membership in my life.

Thanks for making this easy to locate, price, and book.

Almost impossible to use. What were these idiot designers thinking? Total junk. Shove it up your arse Expedia
Version 1.2.2 2012-02-23 1
This is my first time to book using this app and now that my account has been charged the app won't open and keeps shutting down.
Version 1.2.2 2012-02-20 1
Easy to use, attractive but you can't find you itinerary in your account when you book via this app!!!
Version 1.2.2 2012-02-20 1
Be very careful - this app is not what it says it is.  I booked a room, got my confirmation email from Expedia but when I tried to change my itinerary it was nowhere to be found at Expedia.  After phoning customer service I was told it was actually a Hotels.com booking . . . news to me!  Not in the reservation info itself, not in the email, no link to hotels.com.   Ridiculous, useless application.  I'm deleting it immediately.
Version 1.2.2 2012-02-19 1
My reservation confirmation did not get to the hotel. I called customer service several times before receiving help was disconnected FOUR times before I got an agent. Finally got through and was told that i had to call hotel.com customer service. Never again will I use Expedia or hotels.com and I will tell everyone I know!
Version 1.2.2 2012-02-19 5

I love this app!  Probably one of the best apps out today. Makes travel so easy!
Version 1.2.2 2012-02-16 1
I have booked many rooms and flights thru expedia and when I go to receive my rewards for my trips I have a big fat Goose egg on my account.  Then I try and log into my account to see my itinerary and there is nothing there.  Called customer service and they tell me I don't get any rewards because the app is partnered with hotels.com...Please explain to me why is it partnered with hotels.com and everything I receive from expedia about my reservations do not have anything to do with hotels.com and when the guy asked for the customer service number I received at first he said it was for expedia and when I told him thats the same number I received he told me that was for hotels.com...??? really?!?!?! Way to change it up there buddy.  I gave him my confirmation number and Itinerary number and he still could not find anything on my account about my trips...Like I stated before...great and convient app but horrible when it comes to customer service.
Version 1.2.2 2012-02-16 1
Entered a wrong digit for my security code.  The app would not recognize corrected information after entering security code. Had to use another card to complete booking.
Version 1.2.1 2012-02-15 5
Used this on our last trip and it was a life saver. 1am looking for a hotel ahead on I95 and it shows pics, amenities, and pricing.  What more can you ask for!
Version 1.2.2 2012-02-14 2
Now that I've booked once, the darn thing crashes every time I try to open it.

Can't look up my itinerary online even with the provided itinerary number and email. 

Wish it would have let me look at an overview before booking. Now I will probably have to cancel and rebook because it wouldn't let me enter special preferences and I can't access my itinerary without calling Expedia.
Version 1.2.2 2012-01-22 5
I like creating my bookings on this site. The info presentation is easy and straightforward.
Version 1.2.2 2012-01-21 1
This app was great, but now it can't connect to Expedia. It seems something went wrong with the upgrade.
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-20 1
I downloaded this yesterday to make a fast booking while I was traveling.  There was no option to log in with my Expedia account, so I had to fill in my address and credit card number.  The next time I started the app, it crashed after two seconds; but I did see a confirmation in my email, so I thought things were okay.

Today I arrived at the hotel and they told me that I have TWO reservations.  I checked my bank's app, and sure enough -- two debit card charges.  I had to bring up Expedia's site to find a customer service number (because this app always crashes now!) and they had to transfer me to the other company that manages this app. I stayed on hold for fifteen minutes before reaching a much less friendly rep, who asked me to hold for "four or five more minutes" while she confirmed with the hotel that I was only using one reservation.  I was then hung up on.  I haven't confirmed yet whether the second charge was reversed.

It's one thing for an app to crash on start.  It's another for it to cost me money and then give me no effective way to get resolution.  Technically and financially, this thing is a disaster.  I've had nothing but positive experiences with Expedia until now.  They shouldn't have put their name on this third-party failure.

Used this app one time and expedia stole money from me. Scammers they are. No customer service. Was hung up on and treated like a felon. Service rep manager even confirmed it was because of a known system error they are working on, but refused to help at all  they are crooks. DONT USE THIS APP OR EXPEDIA. Will never look at them again after this. Deleting app. Hope more people will think twice before throwing money away by using this app. Do yourself a favor call hotel directly. Only getting one star because i have to select something. They wanted my family to walk home 300 miles because of this known system error. Never again expedia, after reading some on internet im not alone in these complaints. Run away from this app and expedia. Not sure how they are still in business

This app allows me to book hotels room any where any time.
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-15 5
From the point of installing this app to receiving confirmation of my bookings it only took me 5 minutes and I got a 10% discount. Awesome! So easy and clear to navigate through.
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-15 1
First of all they double booked me.
Second it books thru hotel.com which it doesn't  disclose.  I called Expedia and they said no reservation found you have to call hotel.com, they transferred me to another country and the problem was not corrected or found.  Very bad service.  Long wait and no help.  So I am calling my cc company to refute the charges.  use a computer @ Expedia.com instead.  On top of that no cancelation or refund for the extra room the booked.
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-15 1
This app is no good and customer service does not help at all!! Took me a half say to get my money back!

Excelente app!!
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-13 1
I was really exicted about this app, since I book frequently through Expedia. Used it for the first time this week and it double-booked me. I find the app very limited in that as far as I can tell, you can't book a complete package, only fliight, then hotel, then a car, which is a pain! Additionally, you can't sign-in to your Expedia account from this app, so anything booked doesn't show up on your iteneraries (and therefore doesn't get applied to your point accumulation). Overall I have been very disappointed and have deleted the app.
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-13 1
Sure, it's simple enough, but be very wary:
If you fat-finger it, you could mess up up your dates.
Which means you could go to a hotel. And have the wrong reservation dates. 
Which then means you have to call Expedia. Only they don't hold the actual reservation, per se; it's through hotels.com. 
So you wait.
And wait.
And wait.
Eventually, it gets fixed. But not after you spend half an hour on the phone. Trying to get it all worked out To make it even more awesome, try doing it it in a foreign country.
Beyond the touchscreen, it is a very inelegant UX. shame on you Expedia.

This is a great app when all you want to book is a room! Check back as often as you can to get the best prices available! NY, here I come!
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-09 1
Tried to reserve a room and a prompt showed up saying that the room was already booked so I booked another room which was successful. Only to find out that I had now reserved 2 rooms. Now Expedia will not give me a refund due to user error!!!!!
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-09 5
I have used this app over and over and it has never failed me. I just made a reservation at a boutique hotel - and the app's price was 20% off the hotel's Internet rate. It seriously rocks.
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-09 5
Fantastic! Absolutely love the ease of using this app and the abilities it has. Have only used it a few times, but has really helped in booking hotels last minute on the go as I love to travel spontaneously.

Great interface, information, and everything else! This app has everything you need to plan a vacation.
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-08 1
One star is way to high! This is the third reservation I've tried through this app and EVERY TIME it has double booked and double charged me. While Expedia is quick to take my money, they are not so quick to return it. Instead of simply voiding the transaction, they have been processing as a return. USERS BEWARE!

Great potential if they would add combined hotel and flight, as well as a longer calendar of dates.
Also, It crashes every time!!
-Overall.. For being free.. Not terrible. But not good either.
Version 1.2.1 2012-01-01 3
This app is good and very convenient to book hotel. However, sometimes the app books the hotel room twice. Then u have to call the customer service. They told me they will give me a refund only if the hotel gives refund to them. I got my refund but I wonder what if... Funny thing is I did not even know the room was booked twice until the hotel told  me I had a reservation for 2 rooms.

Version 1.2 2011-12-09 1
I agree with previous reviewers - while the app is ok for searching for good deals, do your booking elsewhere as Expedia's customer service is as bad as off-shored customer service can get. It took me 10 phone calls with uninformed representatives, waiting on the line for a total of 2 hours, a few 'we will check and call you back' calls that were never followed up on, and over 2 months of waiting before I managed to get a refund for a flight that was cancelled by the airline..
Version 1.2 2011-12-09 3
Awesome on my new iPad2 it's a must for all my family vacations
Version 1.1.2 2011-12-08 1
Expedia has the absolute WORST customer service I've ever experienced.  They *will* leave you hanging out to dry and if you ever manage to reach a real person on the phone, they will basically tell you "TOO BAD".

I cannot possibly stress how poor this company is at looking after it's customers.  Escalate your problem and they won't even call you back.  It's all foreign call-center nonsense and form-letter email replies.  If you're lucky enough to have your trip go smoothly with Expedia, consider yourself fortunate.  But if you run into any problems, believe me: you're #~(<%*!!!

And just like AOL in the nineties, they make it impossible to close your account online.  Go ahead.  Try it.  See what happens!

This app is awful for Expedia account holders.  It does not make reservations through Expedia at all.  Rather it makes reservations through Hotels.com.  The user will not have access to the itinerary on their Expedia account and will not get rewards credit for the reservation.  The Expedia operators are completely confused about the app and cannot access the itinerary or provide any support.
Version 1.1.2 2011-12-01 5
Works like a charm on my iPhone 4 with latest operating system.
Version 1.1.2 2011-11-26 3
I don't know why the Expedia app hates me so much. After selecting a hotel and entering my credit card details, the app crashes about 2/3 of the time when I try I submit my reservation. It's great for finding hotel info but VERY frustrating for booking.
Version 1.1.2 2011-11-26 4
Easy to use, accurate. I wish there was a spot for "note for the hotel" or "email hotel with additional information" so I could be sure they know we have a pet. Otherwise, good app.

Gray on gray text is very difficult to read, and you are only able to sort by class stars, not reviewer stars. That means you have to open one at a time to see which ones to avoid. I also noticed the lists are severely limited and are a fraction of what's online. Same with reviews; not all are visible on the app.

I much prefer Expedia's hotel app to Kayak's hotel search. The UI, map view, filtering, reviews, photos and prices are superb. 

The only feature that seems to be lacking is a way to "star" or favorite some hotels to easily compare a few places you might want to stay. Add this and you've got an unbeatable app!
Version 1.1.2 2011-10-25 4
Looking for this kinda app, and i found it the appstore thank you
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-25 5

Nuff said

Fabulous! Was able to book my hotel in a flash!
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-23 5
I travel a lot since my husband is in the Navy and I sometimes need reservations on short notice. This app is fast, convenient, and easy to use- excellent!
Version 1.1 2011-10-23 5
Fast & ez

It's a very cool app. It books the hotel room every time.
Version 1.1 2011-10-20 5
Love it.  Fast. Easy. Saves me a fortune on the fly.
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-19 5
I love this app!!!
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-19 5
I just downloaded this app, booked a trip to san fran, and was confirmed on the spot. It then prompted me to add to my calender. It was all taken care of with a few clicks. Very cool!
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-16 5
Has the best prices and I love the pictures on the app of the hotel they look clear and beautiful! Great information of the hotels too!
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-15 5
Expedia.com is great and I've used it for more than 15 years to book travel. This app bring that experience to your phone in a very convenient way. I actually prefer this app to the website. Bravo expedia!
Version 1.0.2 2011-10-13 5
Very easy to use and very accurate and detailed info.
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-13 2
Crashes every time I look at the map. Deleted the app.
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-13 5
Such a great app for quick booking
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-12 5
Simple to use but would be nicer if filter had more options, like pool, Internet, etc.
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-08 5
5 stars!
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-07 5
Sooo quick n sooo easy! Luv it!!!
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-06 4
I've been using Expedia for ever... Booked airline tickets, rented cars, booked hotel rooms. This was the easiest thus far... Pulled my info from my phonebook and booked it!  Great app!
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-05 5
I love this APP! I use it all the time! I never travel without it.
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-04 1
I love Expedia, and their Trip Assist app. This hotel finder needs some help though. I can't filter out hotels that are booked full on the nights I need them. Also, this would be the perfect app if I could get flights and rental cars, I normally never just book a hotel.
Update: I just realized that this is a third party app that's not part of Expedia. I need my reward points, so I'm deleting it now. I'll just use Expedia's website.
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-03 4
It only took a few minutes.
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-02 4
Very nice.
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-02 5
Simple and easy..just how I like 'em I mean it.
Version 1.1.1 2011-10-01 5
Works awesome!
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-28 5
Cool app
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-28 4
App had a lower price than the web site. Expedia also had the hotel $17 less than all other sites.  It was very quick, fast, and easy.  I would like to be able to sign into my expedia.com account when I use the app.  Otherwise, I really thank you for it.
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-28 5
Very handy
Version 1.1 2011-09-27 1
Booked hotel yesterday and got confirmation # and says charged to credit card. Hotel had no record. Even got confirmation email. Called expedia. State no record. Sure hope I don't get charged twice!!! Usuallly have no problems with expedia.
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-27 5
I really like this app, it's fast and easy to book. The only bad thing is I read the review under me that said you can't get credit to your Expedia account, I've booked this way 3 times already. I wonder if the price is the same though. I just booked next Monday the newly opened Plaza in downtown LV where the entire property is completely redone and the deluxe room was $20. Going for our anniversary & really like downtown so we thought we would give this place a shot. The mayor we had here for 12 years is opening up an upscale steakhouse called Oscar's plus there is another to die for restaurant called Hash House A Go Go. So I figure it has to be a great place. Guess we will see soon!
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-26 1
I booked a room thru this app.apparently they outsource the booking to hotels.com.expedia told me they couldn't credit my rewards account for this trip since it was not booked thru expedia...??? customer service wouldn't help me, supervisor wouldn't even take my call.told me that i could cancel reservation and re-book thru expedia.thought i booked thru expedia the first time. will not use this app again....
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-25 4
Super simple to use with no annoying registration steps. The ability to select your address from your addressbook was slick and helpful.
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-23 4
Easy to use!  Awesome!
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-22 5
I have found great rates and been able to make affordable short term plans.
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-19 5
Very easy to use and navigate, lots of useful pictures and info to help me find the right hotel. I used this app to find a dream hotel in Santa Cruz, and my partner said it was one of the best weekend getaway ever!
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-16 5
This app is awesome
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-16 5
Found hotel and info in 3 minutes.
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-14 5
I've downloaded many apps and this one by far had the best pics, prices, and hotel search results than any other.
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-12 5
I loved the auto fill option, smart dudes. The info is highly reliable: I checked for hotels on Kayak, TripAdvisor and Google and none gave me useful info like this app, plus I got a deal that was (anonymously) posted on Priceline at a lower price, since there are no fees here.
Congrats
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-12 5
Just booked my hotel with it for our Hawaii trip!
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-12 5
I always thought this app would be a waste of time as I have the other Expedia app also, how wrong could I have been, this app is really useful and gets straight to the point, you can easily compare prices of rooms, change dates easily. It's never crashed on me so this app gets all 5 stars, best of all it's free, well dine Expedia!
MH, NC, USA
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-12 1
Nice and slick- then it crashes, crashes and crashes- but only after capturing your credit card info- I smell a bad rat- don't install this!!
Version 1.1 2011-09-10 5
Awesome site
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-10 1
This app constantly crashes. I would use this app quite frequently if it were not for it crashing all the time!
Version 1.1 2011-09-09 5
Really the best app
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-09 5
User friendly app makes booking a room a breeze. Would recommend to friends.
Version 1.1 2011-09-08 5
This is really the best application ever for hotel and flights reservation. 
I'm traveling to shanghai and I found incredible prices that I didn't find in any other websites...
It's really great....
Version 1.1 2011-09-08 1
The app works fine...but to say it is affiliated with Expedia...must be a lie! I booked a hotel with them, I am a user of Expedia (the real thing), but you don't get reward points using this app.
If they are going to claim affiliation with Expedia, you should get your award points.
DO NOT USE THIS APP,
Version 1.1.1 2011-09-08 1
Same here tried to search and crashedddd everytime!!!!
Version 1.1 2011-09-07 1
I can enter search parameters and it will retrieve a listing/map of hotels, but once a hotel is selected the app shuts down and crashes every single time.
Version 1.1 2011-09-03 5
I'm totally stunned at how nice this app is.
Version 1.1 2011-09-02 5
Great, smooth very helpful app

Thank you, keep up the good work!!

Version 1.1 2011-08-30 5
Totally sweet!
Version 1.1 2011-08-30 1
It crashes every time I use the filter and then return to select the details on a hotel.
Version 1.1 2011-08-29 5
Great app perfect in every way
Version 1.1 2011-08-28 2
Are you kidding me... I just want to book a room.
Version 1.1 2011-08-27 5
Mapping and price feature are great
Version 1.1 2011-08-27 5
One of the best looking, most user-friendly, and functional apps out there. Very well done! May more follow Expedia's example.
Version 1.1 2011-08-27 5
The expedia app was super easy to use and made booking a hotel simple. Nice job!
Version 1.1 2011-08-26 4
Love it
Version 1.1 2011-08-26 5
Very well designed, fast and functional. One of the better apps I've ever used.
Version 1.1 2011-08-26 3
Easy to use, helped me find a cheap hotel for a trip to NYC . Hopefully it's a good hotel!
Version 1.1 2011-08-25 5
Very easy to use, made planning a Labor Day weekend vacation super easy!
Version 1.1 2011-08-24 5
I love this app. Best interface in the app store for lodging!!!
Version 1.1 2011-08-23 5
Easy and fast! I've had no problems with it and love how I can add the hotel right to my map as well. Slick.
Version 1.1 2011-08-22 2
For some reason the app crashes frequently. Tried it with my iPod and iPhone and it's the same. It needs some bug fixes soon!
Version 1.0.2 2011-08-21 5
We were @ a concert a couple hours from home & decided to stay overnight- other companies won't let u book after 11pm, but we were able to book our hotel after our concert & it was a great deal!
Version 1.1 2011-08-21 4
Very easy to use.  :)
Version 1.0.2 2011-08-19 5
So easy and fast ... Found a booked a Nashville hotel in 5 minutes!
Version 1.1 2011-08-19 5
I really liked this app. It is easy to use and runs efficiently. Some room for improvement on integration with Tripit and with my current expedia account. I shared the confirmation via email to plans@tripit, but Tripit couldn't interpret the confirmation properly. However, forwarding the confirmation email received from Expedia afterwards worked as usual. Being able to copy my contact info from my Contacts is really good, but I would like to get that info from my Expedia account itself. At Expedia.com I already have credit card and frequent flyer numbers associated with my account.
Version 1.1 2011-08-19 5
Awesome app!
Version 1.1 2011-08-19 5
Saved my day in LA, got the app, got a room, less than five minutes. Easy to use. I looked at the hotel website for a room and none were available. This app got me the room, and a great price!
Version 1.1 2011-08-19 4
1 minute to make a reservation and pay!  That's exactly what apps are supposed to do.  Great time and money saver.
Version 1.1 2011-08-18 5
Easy to use! Love it
Version 1.1 2011-08-18 5
Easement of use, hotel app for dummies is more like it! Very prompt and quick transactions with confirmation email, very secure as well!
Version 1.1 2011-08-17 5
Very user-friendly, quick and easy to use! If only all apps were like this! Nicely done.
Version 1.1 2011-07-29 5
I use this app to find hotels in philly when going to see the Phantastic Phillies. It is fast fast fast...dependable and the prices are great too!
Version 1.1 2011-07-29 5
Super easy to use. Great stuff expedia!
Version 1.1 2011-07-28 5
This App. Is super easy to use, love it!
Version 1.1 2011-07-28 5
I tried Orbitz and Bookit - horrible apps. Expedia worked like a charm and very easy/quick to use. Booked my hotel in less than 5 minutes!
Version 1.1 2011-07-27 5
App is on point. Super smooth & easy to use. Definitely the best hotel app by a longshot.
Version 1.1 2011-07-26 5
Incredible app, lightning fast, using current location is great, fantastic.
Version 1.1 2011-07-24 5
What an amazing app- was at hotel lobby check in desk - online rate was cheaper- booked it while I was standing at counter and they immediately received my reservation and checked me in quicker than if I would have checked in with the hotel at the desk and save $20.00!! It's fast and easy and it locates all hotels from where your current location is - WOW!!! I have never gave a review before- but this app deserved one!!!!!
Version 1.1 2011-07-24 3
Really an awesome app but you need to be able to look at your account and itinerary info after you book the hotel not just click to be sent to the website in safari. Also you should be able to review a hotel from the app.
Version 1.1 2011-07-24 5
Great App fast and easy!!! A++
Version 1.1 2011-07-23 5
Couldn't be easier
Version 1.1 2011-07-22 5
Very quick does exactly what it says.  Just booked my first hotel!
Version 1.1 2011-07-22 1
...can't do anything. Zero stars.
Version 1.1 2011-07-20 2
Excited at first by how fast and easy to search for hotels, but soon realized not all hotels are listed in this app. Bottom line...useless.
Version 1.1 2011-07-18 5
Really easy to use. Took hardly any time to find a hotel I wanted and booking was fast and easy.
Version 1.1 2011-07-18 5
Downloaded and used this app for the first time this evening. Was able to easily find the hotel I wanted and book a room for the dates needed from the comfort of my chair on my iPad. Will definitely use this app in the future.
Version 1.1 2011-07-17 4
Very easy to use, but it doesn't have the option for smoking or no smoking room. Other than that it was great.
Version 1.1 2011-07-17 5
Very user friendly!!!!   I will continue to use this app when booking rooms. 1st transaction was unbelievably easy and painless. 5 star !!!!!!!!
Version 1.1 2011-07-17 5
Looks beautiful and very intuitive!  Great work Expedia!
Version 1.1 2011-07-16 5
It is a life saver. I used it to book my room while I was boarding and when I got off the plane my room was ready.
Version 1.1 2011-07-16 5
After sitting in the hot sun on a motorcycle on I-70 waiting in an accident related backup for two hours it was obvious my hotel plans needed to be changed. With sketchy 3G service I downloaded 3 other, and higher rated apps only to find that they did not do what I needed. I needed to plug in a city and find a list of available rooms that included rate information and the ability to book the room without the hassle of being sent to a different browser. This app does it all in one stop, it could not be simpler. Wow a free app that is useful! When  booking hotels just a few hours before you will need them because you are unsure where you will end up (road-trip mode) this app will deliver. It just plain works, there are several sort and filter options, and it is intuitive. Get this one!!
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-15 4
Profound to the new update, this app was far from user friendly. I'm now impressed with the ease it took to book a room. Go job, Expedia.
Version 1.1 2011-07-14 5
Very happy with the added search options and user reviews! Great app and great team behind it!
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-14 3
We booked two hotels within hours of check-in, and while on the road, with great results.  Unfortunately, while trying to book a hotel in Europe, the app keeps highlighting my billing street address as a problem.  I used the website to book the same hotel using exactly the same billing street address and was successful in booking.  Is this a bug, Expedia?  I think I updated versions between my States bookings and my overseas attempt to book.
Version 1.1 2011-07-14 4
Design is pretty awesome
Version 1.1 2011-07-14 4
While the iPhone app doesn't have the full functionality as the website, that's to be expected, it's a quite effective alternative on the go. New filters and sorting capabilities are a great improvement. Nice job!
Version 1.1 2011-07-14 5
Wow!  This is one of the best apps I've used.  Even sitting in front of my computer, I'll turn to this app before the website because it is much easier to use than even the Expedia site.  Nice touches include:

- Very fast, even with spotty Internet connection in the michigan's U.P.
- Autofill contact details from my contact with quick checkboxes to decide amongst my phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses in a couple quick taps.
- Map integration worked great.
- Navigating reviews was fast and easy.
- Images of hotels scrolled by with no work on my part, but I could swipe amongst them with immediate response.

Altogether, a real delight to use.

Crashes tje instant you click tje list format. Also crashed when click pn hotel name. Pls fix.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-11 5
This app is so easy and efficient. I love that it is organized by price, saves your address but not your credit card number, and adds the dates right to your iPhone calendar. Also there are no mix-ups if you need to cancel because the hotel's policy is spelled out before you confirm. I would highly recommend it.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-10 5
Efficient, fast and saves money! The app is easy and hasn't let us down!
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-09 5
Very quick and easy to search and compare amenities and photos!! Will be using this often!!

Great apps, Fast, easy and clean user interface
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-09 5
Great app. User friendly. Super easy to use.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-08 1
Silly me, I assumed Expedia created this standalone app for hotels to make my life easier. Wrong! You'll notice in the screen shots that there is no user signed in. That's because you can't. Which means you end up with an orphan booking that does not appear in 'My Itineraries' on the website, which means no rewards points. Awesome! FAIL!!!!
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-08 5
Worked great!!  Easy to use!
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-08 5
Better then priceline
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 2
Left us with much to be desired. No refrigerator or microwave. The room looks like a 1 or 2 star hotel. We were surprised that Marriott has their name out front.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 3
Expedia did a great job with this app. It's one of the easiest hotel booking workflows I've ever seen. 

The one huge omission is detailed customer reviews. It's possible I just couldn't figure out where to find them, so if they're in there, my score jumps to 5 stars.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 4
This was so quick and easy!
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 1
In my humble opinion, just not enough customizable options. Especially for a family of six.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-07 5
Excellent app! So fast and easy to use. Highly recommend it. Two thumbs up!
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-06 5
This is a great app to browse hotels their prices and location.

Great layout and easy to use.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-05 5
I love this app. No need to shop around, Expedia makes travel arrangements quick and painless. So why not take a vacation!?  Really!?
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-05 3
So simple and easy! I love this app!
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-05 5

Driving down a two lane highway in the hill country with little service and was still able to book my hotel for work this week, gotta love this app.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-04 5
Excellent app.  Very easy and fun to use. Much faster than searching and booking over the computer.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-03 4
Loved it, it was quick but I needed to add a note.  On the old Expedia version you could a note/request to your hotel you've booked.  In our case I was bring our pet, I to call the hotel directly and then call Expedia about my travel points.
Version 1.0.2 2011-07-03 5
Real time inventory on 4th of July.
Version 1.0.2 2011-06-15 1
Yea thanks a lot for the old bait and switch routine.  I used this supposed Expedia app. Only to find out after many phone calls to, I guess India, that this app booked me through Hotels.com, even though the confirm email said it was from Expedia!
I used this app so I could get the Expedia points! But that didn't happen because this app books you through Hotels.com which I was told by some of the sometimes hard to understand (outsourced to India)
But pleasant phone techs that Hotels.com is an affilliate of Expedia. Well that's great but the people who designed this app forgot that someone might likely use this app so they would get points credit for their reservations. 
Conclusion. After wasting hours on the phone  I cancelled the reservation and booked through Expedia.com on my laptop, and got my deserved points.  I will likely never use this app again and I will tell all my friends to do the same.
Version 1.0.2 2011-06-13 4
Wish we could save or favorite for later though.

Easy to use, fast, user friendly! I've used it several times already!
Version 1.0.2 2011-06-13 1
Weird that I'm the only one with this problem. I had iPhone 3GS and this app crashed every time I tried to search out of my local area. I thought it might just be my phone. I recently upgraded to iPhone 4 and the app crashes before opening. So, it's not my phone. Interesting that this app has 4 stars. Good thing it's free!
Version 1.0.2 2011-06-12 5
Very user friendly, fast, and easy...best free app I have:)
Version 1.0.2 2011-06-12 5

Really well done, I just wish there was an iPad version.

Nice app that won't accept my card info; therefore, I cannot book any of the hotels it located. Bank has confirmed that the problem is with Expedia. Oh well...

This app is really useful but when u want to cancel ur reservation or booking it does not let u know who did the booking.. I booked by this app n received my confirmation by email from EXPEDIA .. Changed my plans wanted to cancel my booking surprised it was booked by HOTELS.com .. Even though both r partners in booking but I wasted my time with the one n then it's the 2nd company .. I expect to receive my confirmation from who did my booking .. That's y I gave it a 3 star ..

Entire booking process went without a hitch - especially considering I was making the booking riding a NYC cab!
Version 1.0.2 2011-06-05 5
Easy to use!  We live out in the suburbs and decided to spend the night in town rather than drive back home. We downloaded the app and booked a great hotel within walking distance at a great price in under 5 minutes!

I'm shocked at how much I enjoy using this app. The UI is really well done and the results are relevant. Very nice job.

Even if you think you can get a cheaper rate through another service, this is the best app for viewing rooms, locales, pics. 
Please keep adding hotels to your database expedia. Thanks!

I am not sure why the app needs to default to your current location.  Its pretty seldom that I don't actually have a place when I am actually on-site.  If I was stuck in an airport in Chicago, I suppose it could come in handy.  But even then, I could just type "OHare".   I suppose it would come in handy if I didn't know where I was.  But the last time that happened, I had been kidnapped and was in the trunk of a car, so I wasn't really concerned about a hotel.  It just wastes my time when I open the thing up and the phone has to first search for my location using the GPS.

And if you are going to default to current location, I think you could at least have a sort option for "distance".

Another issue, limit the total distance in a search, especially if you sort by price.  I don't think I need to know that the cheapest hotel available is the Stinkpot Motel 42 miles south of my target location.  Maybe 10-15 miles is a good place to stop.

These guys totally redeemed themselves with this one...expedia's other attempts have been terrible and should be removed from the store (their brands have suffered enough from these embarrassing "apps"...this plants the seed for greatness, where's the flights, packages apps:)?  If done right, expedia could reclaim their glory...and, I'll be one happy euro traveler!

And the rest of it works, too!
Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
A must have if you are constantly on the go and need a quick way to find a hotel at a great rate.
Version 1.0 2011-04-08 4
Very cool app and easy to use! Would have given a 5 but you cant read reviews, which I believe would be useful to everyone.
Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
It takes a great app. for me to type up a review and this is one of them. This is the best hotel app. ever. So easy to use and the interface is beautiful. Nice job, Expedia!
Version 1.0 2011-04-08 5
And for free app, it's amazing app. Especially for travellers!

Those Mobiata Masters of UI design have actually made the task of finding hotels fast and fun. Kudos!

Would be nice to see customer reviews and a mechanism to bookmark/favorite the hotels you're interested in (-1 star).

Very nice and clean UI. Easy to use and to navigate. Great job Expedia!
Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
The Expedia app has a great UI and I mean GREAT. The date-range picker is the best I've used! The app is fast as well. It finds hundreds hotels near you within seconds and shows you their price, location and availability. And with the unbeatable price, it's a no-brainer. A must-have for travelers!
Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
I like this a lot! So much easier than dealing with their website. I do hope they add flights and cars eventually.  5 stars for this implementation.
Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
Another great, best-class user experience!
Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
This app is useful and even better it is well designed! The UI is easy to understand and clean. Awesome app. Thanks.
Version 1.0 2011-04-07 5
Seriously whoever put time into the design of this app is from the future. The intro screens rocking door hanger, hash marks on the scroll to indicate trip advisor ratings, and the, very easy to use date selector (Apple take notes) on the calendar. Superb!
