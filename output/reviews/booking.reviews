For a frequent traveller like myself. Genius discounts are great. Other than genius the hotel rate you get is the same any other channel would offer you. But the app makes it easy to organize view and modify bookings
Version 6.2 2014-02-21 4
The app is very user friendly. I'm very happy with it.

This app is so helpful. Some websites don't turn out very good apps, and you end up using the full web version anyway- this app didn't lose anything from the full web version. 

It is super convenient. Searching and filtering searches is simple, and you can do absolutely everything smoothly.
Version 6.2 2014-02-18 5
Downloaded the app and 15 mins later I had the reservation completed and the hotel was calling me to confirm my reservation, you can't ask for better.

Muy buena
Version 6.0.1 2014-01-28 5
I first used this app when I was traveling across country without a route or itinerary. When I knew about where I was ready to stop, I pulled up the app and looked for rooms along my way.

Based on customer comments and reviews, I chose a VERY reasonably priced hotel that had me somewhat concerned. The brand isn't known for its amenities, etc. but I trusted the reviewers.

I have never been more pleased with a room. It was everything I demand in a room and a lot of things I hope for. The most important criteria on this particular night was quiet. I was tired and the hotel was near the interstate and downtown. Reviewers said how quiet it was and were so right. 

I have been a convert and regular user ever since. I LOVE and trust this app.

Been using the site since my time in Europe. Never had a problem and remain loyal.
Version 6.0.1 2014-01-25 4
I try to use this app all the time and it works great with no glitchy things. But, I am one of those people who like to filter and filter until I have exactly the pool of hotels I want to look at and the app doesn't seem to do that, so I end up accessing booking.com through the website.
Version 6.0.1 2014-01-25 5

I've used booking.com for several trips (in the US and in Ireland). It is easy and I love that my credit card isn't charged when I book the reservation. It's simplified travel planning for us and since we tend to be "seat of your pants" travelers, that's huge!   Highly highly recommend this app!
Version 6.0.1 2014-01-15 5
This app is a very useful tool, I've using booking.com service for a while, and it helped me a lot, its fast no waiting, and very practical, thanks booking.com team.

Price is listed, provides sufficient info on hotel (enuf for u to makes decisions to look further or pass on it), & the Map is great for seeing all the hotels in the area that you would like to stay. Navigating thru the app is easy. No lag time using iPhone 5. Excellent app design. Thank you.

Version 6.0 2013-12-16 1
Extraordinarily misleading booking process and policies.  When booking a hotel room, app does not clearly display all terms and conditions prior to completion of booking.  
False claim # 1 - credit card information is requested just to reserve the room.  Fact - room was charged/pre-paid for full amount upon completion of booking 
False claim #2 - you may cancel room up to 3 days prior to arrival without penalty.  I tried to cancel booking the same day (had accidentally booked the wrong location) and app/service was going to charge me the full amount.  When I called customer service, rep said they would try to call the hotel to refund the charge; rep put me on hold briefly (too briefly to have made any calls on my behalf) and came back and said, sorry - wasn't able to reach the person at the hotel who has the authority to reverse the charge; try calling again later.  If I could rate this app/booking service less than 1 Star, I would.

O app é muito util mesmo para brasileiros pois está em português e com preços em Real. E ainda guarda todos os dados de reserva como uma foto no seu iPhone. 

The app is usefull even to Brazilian people because it is available in Portuguese and with prices in BRL.

Version 6.0 2013-12-10 5
Not only does this app rival priceline bids (it's sister company) but what makes it 100x better is the pay when you arrive part. Only certain hotels and rooms offer this but boy does it help when you have to book travel before your paycheck or deposit comes in. Wonderful website!

So I'm new to the 📲/Apple family and I never review apps. I kept downloading crappy apps that I think could be better designed and jut have a better user interface. Well I finally got one that stood up to the challenge. I was having a button or conformation issue online. I said I bet it's a app for this, came here and bamm what a beautiful easy way to book a room!!! Showed pics with ease and to top it off when I got my room validation key it looked like a real key going into a key slot. I 💖 it!!!!! Definitely the bet way to go!!!

Beware: This app will annoy you with random crashes. Moreover it does not store your previous search dates. Use web site is safer for your brain.
Version 5.9.1 2013-11-29 4
I wish the app gave the same functionality as the website. On the site I can do searches for multiple rooms with differing numbers of people in the room. Can't do that with the app. Otherwise, it's well done!

Version 5.9.1 2013-11-26 2
I needed to change my booking. The website wouldn't allow the change, so I wanted to talk to someone. No luck finding a number to call. I had to cancel my booking and then work directly with the hotel. Fortunately they were nice and the same price. Probably will not use again.

We just used this tool on a 2 week trip across Northern Europe, selecting hotels the day before arriving in a town or city. It was easy to use, accurate, and gave good info. Filters were also helpful. My one suggestion for enhancement is to be able to add a key location to a map (e.g., "near the train station" or "near city center") to facilitate selection. Thanks, bookings.com, you really made our trip work!

I'm currently using this app on a trip to SE Asia. So far no problems except one with the booking process with hotels, but that was the computer's fault, not booking.com.  Easy to use, it saves your credit card info for easy booking and people's reviews were helpful.  The only negative was that I wish you could save maps and directions to offline.  Oftentimes when I needed the app to find the place I didn't have internet.

The booking app does not have a field for entering children and their ages into the search.  Families with children will have to use the web site portal to enter in children.  This renders the app nearly useless for families.

Other wise, it is the perfect app.  Add children capability and I will give it 5 stars.

Booking.com makes all the other booking sites obsolete.  Take two minutes to create an account with just your email address and a password, and get 50% off at choice hotels.  Give them a try to find out all the other reasons why Booking.com is the best, most user friendly booking site.

I was able to make relatively very good hotel choices given all the info and reviews, and was able to find rooms very short notice. Just think if I was a good planner I could get even better. Always read as many reviews for each hotel and see if maybe other factors affect people's opinions Iike, it's a two star in a bad section of Paris and its high summer. What do you really expect, for example.

Version 5.8 2013-10-01 5
My husband and I are avid travelers and use this app or website quite often. With the latest update, they incorporated a preview map at the top of the screen that highlights where you hotel, B&B, etc is as you scroll through the available options. Fantastic!!! There are a few other great things, but that is my favorite (huge time saver!).
Version 5.8 2013-10-01 5

Version 5.8 2013-09-28 1
I use iPhone 4s With voiceover feature because IM visually impaired. I am not able to input date Information which pretty much makes this app useless to me. It worked just fine before the Update. Go back to the old way you were doing it. This app now works as good as the Travelocity app, Which is to say not very good.

Booking.com in general is a fantastic website for booking hotels. It's easy and most if the time you can cancel for be fee. Their app is just as easy to navigate. I love it and find it indispensable when planning a trip. Especially nice if traveling for a few weeks with more than one hotel bathe app gives you the info right there in your phone.

Version 5.7.1 2013-09-17 2
The app is good as far as booking a room but check the prices before booking.  No discount thru the app no receipt from the hotel and extra fee either from the app itself or the hotel.  Room booked for 1 night at $129 and the ending balance was $172??? AND another charge of $25??? Will not use this type of app again will just book thru the hotel myself

Version 5.7.1 2013-09-16 5
I this this is the best, already booked hostel in Prague and a few in Poland for Christmas. a wide choice of accomodation and, what I love most, they calculate the price immediately! but one thing should be here: search ranging by several criteria, for example, the cheapest and closest to the center. now you can choose only either the cheapest or closest to the center.

We were traveling to Europe on three separate trips this summer. I would check Trip Advisor and other sites for recommendations and reviews, them price some hotels.

As a traveling business owner i dont have time to write reviews but This app is ridiculously awesome.  Was able to secure both a rental car and hotel during a fast plane layover from my phone, at prices that exceeded my expectations. Almost too easy.  All info saves to my calendar and images confirmations to my photo library.  Was able to share with colleagues in a snap.  Obviously this one was truly designed with the customers ease-of-use in mind.

Made looking for a room easy. You get to look at a variety of hotels and there are no surprises. Saved me a ton of money.
Version 5.6.2 2013-08-26 4
Useful but keep in mind, you're only reserving your room when you use your card, not paying for it. You pay when you actually get to the hotel and they always add fees and taxes. So count on paying about $50-$100 more than what's asvertised. It's all in the fine print.

Overall the app is handy. Some good deals can be found BUT there are issues. First , the hotel descriptions
Usually make no reference to pet-friendliness. Making a call to each hotel to find out if they accept pets defeats the purpose of the app. Secondly, the rating system is way off. Read the reviews of the hotels before you book. We booked a room based on a great rating to then read the review that made  the hotel out to be a dump. After check in we found out the review of dump was right, the rating was way off. Beware!

For some bizarre reason, the maps on the app don't show public transportation, therefore, I continue to use the full website...very disappointing.

A nifty little app to get a hotel on the go. The user friendly interface with the multitude of hotels worldwide makes this app a must have.
Version 5.7 2013-08-10 5
I liked it
Version 5.7 2013-08-10 5
There's not much to say-this app is the best booking experience you can imagine. Found myself clicking around and enjoying it for hours. Needless to say we are trying to book as much as we can via this app. They have done a great job imagining what people need when they are looking for hotels, the information architecture / tools at hand deserve standing ovations.

With every update it seems things get even better. Now with plenty of mobile integration like passbook. There's only one thing to complain about: please also add flight booking. Then I wouldn't have to use anything else. Great app, seriously.
Version 5.7 2013-08-10 5
Fácil de usar y muy eficiente para la búsqueda y sugerencia, sobre todo buenos precios, muy útil.

I've been looking at hotels for a trip to New York for 3 weeks and was feeling discouraged since everything was so expensive. We even called our timeshare for help. Spent my hour lunch break searching through the listings and have found 7 reasonable options including apartments that fit our group of 6 instead of booking 2 hotel rooms and they have kitchens! So now my bank account won't suffer as much! Best app ever!
Version 4.7.1 2013-08-08 5
Found several hotels for a European trip this summer all were just what they said they were.  Deffinately recommend !

Nice site to help for vacation and see the world
Version 5.7 2013-08-06 5
Decent search functions, okay filters, but killer pricing.  Much better than booking directly with some of the higher-end hotels.  Probably a good way for hotels to unload some of their excess capacity, without directly discounting their rack rate (which many business travelers likely pay).  Kudos to the app, the underlying software and business model.

Last night I was trying to book a room.  Every time I attempted to complete my booking, the App would tell me that one of the data items I entered was missing or invalid.  I corrected things repeatedly and after 30 minutes of these problems I gave up and booked elsewhere.  I am deleting the app - just go through safari to the regular web site.  It is faster an easier.

I don't know what else to say except it took me only a minute to find another place to stay because I screwed up my original reservation. That alone to me is worth 4 stars.

تتمتع هذه الشركه بمصداقيه ولا يتأخرون في مساعدتك في أي وقت 
اتصلت بهم بسبب ان احد الفنادق في مارينا في مصر رفض السعر الذي تم الحجز به فقاموا فورا بالإتصال بإدارة الفندق وأجبروهم علي قبول الحجز.

Really no deals, App is painfully over bloated for its size and lack of features. Why need an app???, When functions online even on mobile browsers are way better and the deals too. Use my phone space?, Justify it with some value. You will find no value here.

I have been a user of Booking.com since years, and really appreciate their easy service. This app does that too, and makes booking quick and easy. Just, when I'm looking for a hotel near a certain place, or want to see a greater area around my destination, the map that's there is a weeeee bit small... 
Otherwise, works. What more can I say.

If you want me to use your site or e mobile app you have to make it possible for me to download my confirmation to my IPad. It's supposed to be possible but there are NO instructions and my own attempts to figure it out were futile. I haven't got all day to figure this out or several days to wait for you to get back to me. I'm deleting this app.

I saw a comment stating that this app was good when not near a computer and that is so true.  I'm in an airport and have just booked several nights in different hotels while on a last minute vacation out west.  Also this app is nice for when you do book online via your PC, all your confirmation numbers, hotel names, addresses, and phone numbers are with you on your phone via the app. Something else that I noticed today, I forgot to sign in so when I was ready to book my room, I was able to login directly.  It saved my reservation request and pre-populated everything with my information.

Necessário incluir mais filtros, do tipo que a versão on line tem, como por exemplo bairros, WIfi, etc. O mapa também precisa de melhorias. Além disso, a confirmação da reserva deveria conter detalhes do tipo de quarto reservado, evitando assim confusões no check in.

On a month-long cross-country trip in summer 2012, I stumbled across this app. Serendipity! 
   We've been using it ever since to save money on chain hotels (lots of super last-minute deals.) But best of all, it finds those quaint, quirky and totally unique motels and small hotels. Without this app, they are very difficult to find and book.
  Great service app!

I wish you could use the search bar to search directly for hotels and not just locations (cities, regions, islands, etc). Because sometimes the hotel name is much easier to remember than the particular province it's in. And the website works like that so it would be nice for the app to allow it as we'll. otherwise, very good app and company.

I'm able to preview the room, book the room and get directions within 1 minute! Flawless communication between Booking.com and thehotel, even with cancellations. My one wish is that it would offer an "Open In..." For google maps or iPhone maps for the address and map features.

I was booking a hotel , which was a Best Western property. I have a support dog but they won't let me in with the dog! I have had all the papers but they sent me away and Charged me!!!!  According to the European law all facility has to accept support dog just like a person .... I guess they don't care the law.... They don't care if you sick and you need a support dog to travel... Shame on Best western and Booking.com......

I was skeptical if this would work well, however I've been booking B&B's for a family trip over to Ireland and its easy to use. The great thing is that all of the reservations are listed so I can see them all together. I did make a mistake one time and cancelled the reservation and there was no problem at all. So convenient. I love it.

Using the app for several years, made 50+ bookings, good experience

Please add the following to make it even better: 

- add room size to filters, e.g. I would prefer set minimum room size for not to see 4-5 star hotels with small or tiny rooms

- add room floor plan to have better idea of what is the room layout

- add possibility to give hotel chain loyalty card number in the booking form

Thanks!

This app will definitely save you money. I have only used it three times in 3 weeks but it has saved me a little over $200.00 dollars and headaches. I highly recommend this app for everyone. It will also help navigate you to the place you made reservations at. It is by far the greatest app for booking a hotel.  When the say guaranteed lowest prices they ain't lying.

The app is OK, if you use the iPads onscreen keyboard, but if you use a bluetooth keyboard, the app gets all messed up and can not process your booking. When you submit, it moves you items around so it will not process your order because it thinks you didn't type in the correct information. It needs fixed, other than that is works well.

I have been using booking for more than 2 years , I only book thru them
They offer best prices , quick feedback , provide excellent details , help you to find the best deals and they simply make your traveling much easier 
The main reason that encourages me to travel is booking

Thanks for this great app

This app was suggested to me by a coworker and she SWORE by it. Now, I see why! There are very useful sorting filters and information on each hotel you may be looking for. I think it's a beneficial tool for anyone to have if they ever plan to travel at some point, even if you just use it as a solid starting point.
Version 5.2 2013-01-19 4

I downloaded this app along with Expedia, kayak, hotels.com & bookit.  This was by far the most expensive of all.  Kayak had a deal at Harrahs hotel in Vegas for $90/night & this app had it for $238/night.  Expedia & bookit were around $107/night.  Still way better than Booking.com.  I am deleting it now...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME

Version 5.2 2012-12-25 5
This app is a great app because it books your hotel for you and you do not pay until you get there and you also have a choice with many of the hotels to cancel your reservation meaning if you don't like the place you don't have to stay in unlike Travelocity and Priceline to charge you a huge fee just to set you up in around you can get that room for the same price with this app and not get charged so you're saving a lot more money I travel a lot and I honestly love this site!

Need a hotel, apartment or vacation house? This app is a great way to find, view and book them! I wish all apps would be this intuitive and easy to use!
Version 5.2 2012-12-20 5
I've used many apps and websites to book my hotels when I travel and this one is simply the best. Unless some of other websites they show the full price of the rooms for the total stay (usually including taxes etc, except for some countries). the map feature is very useful to locate the hotel or find another hotel in the same area.  It is possible to save the booking confirmation directly in the iPad calendar along with a picture of the confirmation (in the picture folder). A really useful and easy to use app and I prefer to book my hotels with it rather than my computer.

هذا موقع مختصر لبوكنج دوت كوم. وهو سريع و مختصر. انا استخدم موقع بوكنج دوت كوم دائماً لحجوزاتي. لدي اقتراح هو أن تقرأ شروط الحجز قبل اتمام الحجز. لأن بعض الفنادق لا ترد المبالغ، وهذا من الفندق نفسه وليس موقع بوكنج دوت كوم. يجب أن نقرأ.

Great traveling App. I always use it while I'm traveling.
A great added value would be to add the possibility to already pay online … because 2 times, I arrived to the hotel and they didn't accept the price of the App. If it was already paid, I wouldn't have the issue.
Thank you, great tool !

Booked a hotel using the app, arrived at the hotel only to find out that the hotel is closed. To be fair this was after the storm Sandy in NJ when a lot of places didn't have power which is probably why the hotel was closed but why say only 2 more rooms left.

The bottom line: this app gets 5 stars for a great user experience and great products.

There are so many hotel booking apps but this one stands among them all. Most apps allow you to see the hotels on a list view where you can see the limited details or on a map view with no details until you tap them (except for maybe name and price). This map shows both at once allowing you to see some of the details and the map at the same time. This is really helpful when the selection is large but location is really important to you (like when looking in NYC). This view isn't hard to read either because it displays the hotels in the current view of the list with a blue marker while showing all the other hotels in the result as smaller white markers. Moreover, I searched for a week trying to find a really affordable but nice hotel in NYC during the holidays for my anniversary, which seemed like an impossible task, but I found one for $250/night right near Times Square! I thought there surely had to be a catch but there wasn't. I am thoroughly impressed.
Version 5.1 2012-10-26 5
I swear this is the easiest hotel booking I've ever made! This app is so convenient, and the designers included everything you need for easy booking. I routed my trip, saved the image of the booking details to my smartphone and saved the trip to my phone's calendar all from the app!!! After being highly disappointed with some of the most popular booking sites, this was a breath of fresh air. Thank you!!!

All the hotels through this app are 10 to 20% more expensive than other online sites. 
It pops up constant on my home screen.

The negative point is that mariot hotels are not included sometime. 
The other negative is the price higher by about 10-25% of the original of the hotel .

We travel extensively and we were able to research and book hotels through booking.com iphone & iPad apps with great ease and reliability. We last booked hotels in S. Korea, France, Egypt, and Lebanon. The ratings are relevant and the prices are the best available. Highly recommend this app.
Version 5.0 2012-10-15 4
Every booking I have made using booking.com has been fantastic. Always just what it was advertised. And always great priced.

It's a wonderful app, you can search by various fields and narrow. By dates, guests and amenities. We've used it for all our trips!
Version 5.0 2012-10-15 4
This is a great app!  I use it every time I book a hotel stay,
Version 5.0 2012-10-15 4
It facilitates me a faster way to get a hotel, do as it described.
Version 5.0 2012-10-15 5
Awesome app
Version 5.0 2012-10-14 5
Save money, time and be sure to book at the hotel you want. This app is as much part of my traveling as the airfare I buy. I can't book without it anymore. Keep it up!
Version 5.0 2012-10-14 5
I've used this in several countries and states, and it is awesome! The one small bug is where one chooses the check-in day. I always have to choose the day after I wish in order for the correct day to show up. Weird. I don't mind because now I know, but this bug makes it easy to book a day earlier than desired! Some places understand when a customer makes a mistake like this, but some (especially during peak season) will charge for the reserved night regardless. 

I also wish there were a way to easily rate hotels/motels within the app. If there is a way, I'm unaware of it.
Version 5.0 2012-10-13 5
Booking really made our trip decisions easy. A very productive app.

We booked a spa in Mendicino and added something to the special requests which was ignored by anyone and everyone. It not only ended up costing the maximum amount for the room but we also could not use a AAA coupon we purchased for this spa. Have to read the FINE PRINT or it will end up costing you a bundle.

I've used this site a number of times for reservations in USA, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Italy. Compared to competing internet sites it sometimes has slightly better prices. It is much easier to use than proprietary hotel sites and often has significantly better prices. I recently had to cancel an entire vacation itinerary and Bookings was by far the easiest to use in this regard. Because of this, it is now my first choice for travel arrangements.  My last booking was one handed on iPhone while driving... Doable, but next time I'll pull over!

Just updating my old review to say this app only gets better. Love it.

I just came back from a trip abroad and got stranded at Newark Airport at 11:30 PM when our connecting flight was cancelled due to the snow. Many other peoples flights were cancelled as well and the prospect of finding a nearby ( and decent) place to stay for the night looked grim. 
I called a few hotels directly and did a few searches and found nothing. 
Then I decided to try out the Booking.com app I had recently downloaded. I found a room at a Best Western near the airport and booked it immediately through the app. 
When we arrived at the hotel about 20 minutes later there were 2 couples in front of us who had also tried to book rooms online using a different app. The front desk had no record of their bookings and the hotel was by then full. We were apprehensive approaching the desk. 
As it turned out Booking.com had faxed my information to the hotel as soon as they received it (through the reservation I made using the app.) and we got one of the last rooms available that night.
They receptionist at the hotels front desk said 'Booking.com is on top of their game' and I agreed. 
Also the hotel was nice, clean, and in a good location. And we got a great price! 
For being stuck in Newark at 11:30 at night things couldn't have gone more smoothly for us. 
Thanks! 

Good application, very helpfull. Need to be specific about prices per person (many hotels are marked with price and number of beds with breakfast, but it is not clear if price for room or per person). For example price is 900 for three bed room with breakfast, while the same price is for two bed room or four bed room. Very confusing.
Version 4.7.1 2012-08-11 5

My friend told me about this app at the beginning of the year and I have been using it to book all my trips. I had an issue where the hotel charged me for canceling 3 days before the deadline. I was getting no where with the hotel so I called booking.com and they were all over it. Needless to say that the hotel manager called me and refunded my money. Great customer service, great hotel rates (most of which require no deposit) and a very user friendly app.

Nicely done but could be better designed.
Version 4.6 2012-07-15 5
The only problem is that this app does not list how rooms in each hotel...otherwise my fav travel planning place!!!!!!
Version 4.6 2012-07-15 4
Have been using the web version and I really like the iPad version. Easy to navigate and find hotels just by moving around the map which is a really cool feature. My only recommendation would be to be able to email the hotel I found directly from the app to a friend to show them the hotel. At the moment you need to go directly to the webpage to be able to share the link to the hotel. I recommend this app.
Version 4.6 2012-07-15 1
It is slow. It crashes

I have used them on two trips they ,had not only great prices but
The hotels were four stars . This is good value ! Loved them , the hotel,s were better than expected ! 
Good value , great places !!! Happy to use only them ! In Germany found one the best surprises the hotel was fun 
Good room,s great time , a pillow bar , if you did not like your pillow you can pick out of many choices ! Good food 
A great bar & band ! Free parking , the lift was a shower take. Your camera great for photo,s & ice breaker as you check -in !
Version 4.6 2012-07-13 5

You just have to try it to understand. They to above and beyond any accommodation app AND website I've ever seen.

Used this app more than once, it's great. My only comment is that the phone number of the hotel should be readily available in case you need to inquire about the exact location or have any other questions.

Booked via this app. Needed to cancel which was promised as no problems on the website. They are charging me the full price for cancelation despite of 48h advanced notice. Stay away from this site and stick with more reputable like Travelocity etc.

This is the first time I have used booking.comto arrange accommodations for travel.  I have been very impressed.  Your website is most helpful, it is easy to use and very intuitive.  During the course of the last 2 weeks I have used the site to book several international reservations and I have been very pleased with the information provided re. the hotels and the speed of the booking process and the quick and complete email confirmations.  During these two weeks I have also had occasion to cancel a reservation, to modify a reservation, to make a special request of a hotel.  All of these aspects of booking have been handled promptly and efficiently by booking.com.  I have also added the booking.com app to my iPhone and have found it to be a 5 star app.  I am very pleased with the service of booking.com.

This app has been a life saver. We came to Europe with limited plans pending how well my spouse tolerated a medical procedure.

I typed in Sandusky. Nothing. 

Then Sandusky, OH. nothing.

Then Sandusky, OH, USA. Nothing.

Does it even read the search? It came up with Santiago. Not even close. It didn't even show an Ohio hotel. Terrible app.

Really easy, to use and good overall
But when I cancel a booking, it doesn't update the My Bookings section, even though when I review the booking on the website or try to cancel it on the app, it opens up the booking in my browser to a page saying its already been cancelled. Please fix it!

I use the website pretty often. Obviously the options are a bit more limited but I really like that I can track all my reservations on my phone (I originally made them online.) but I've also done searches for accommodations with it as well.

كما ارى ان يتم اضافة عدد الغرف لكل شقة والتوضيح اكثر وتحدث الصور 
لان الشخص يحجز بناء علي الصور الموجودة بالموقع وعند الذهاب يجد الفرش قد قدم واتسخ ومن زمن بعيد لم يغيير 
فهذه مصيبة

I made my reservation on my iPad through booking.com because the site stated I could cancel my reservation 24 hours beforehand without being charged. The only reason I booked it was because of this.
Time comes and I decide to cancel 24 hours before and I'm informed I have to pay for one night. I called customer service to be informed I still have to pay. I explained to her I made my appointment through my iPad and was told iPads server was different from the one she is using. I said " how can you charge me for my room when you can't even see what I'm looking at?". They charged me anyway. 
I will never use this site again. I used it for Italy, New York and recently, Miami. 
I'm just so disappointed and feel taken advantage of.

This app is great! Have been using it to book hotels for our Europe trip. Does everything it's supposed to do, and isn't buggy...unlike TripAdvisor. Adds events to iCal and has capability of saving booking information as a picture!
Version 4.4 2012-04-13 1

Fare is quite competitive
Version 4.4 2012-04-12 5
The best part is you can even book the day of arrival (before noon). I just use it on the go and don't worry about booking a week ahead of time. Excellent choices. Reviews are better than stars for picking a good place plus the map always let's you know if the hotel is convenient to the train or sightseeing.
Version 4.4 2012-04-12 5

I have been using booking.com since 2008 and every time it search guaranteed best price and quality hotels. And now there is a handy app. Can't get better than this.. Cheers..
Version 4.4 2012-04-11 4
The only thing that held me back from a 5 star rating is the fact that I'd like to see more consistency on room pictures.  It should be required that to list your property, a picture of each room be supplied.

I used this app to book in Montreux, Switzerland and I found it frustrating that not all room types had photos.  On example was a historic hotel with pics posted of the standard room and the option for a "superior" room for $100 more.  The room dimensions are identical for both standard and superior so photos could have made all the difference.
Version 4.4 2012-04-10 4
Use it for booking hotels and this just does the job.
Version 4.4 2012-04-10 5

Version 4.4 2012-04-10 2
This app takes too long to load cities, and does not show everything that the mobile site has to offer. I love booking.com and their mobile website however I believe that this app isn't up to their standards.

Nice app! Its useful!! :)
Version 4.4 2012-04-06 1
Used the app and the price doubled. Upon receiving my verification, the dates were wrong and since it was non-refundable, phone calls, e-mails, etc. The end of the day, my price got doubled for the same rooms, and I will be making my own reservations in the future since I don't need an app to lose money for me. Try to make one that makes money for me-then we'll talk.
Version 4.4 2012-04-05 5
In my opinion, using this app is much easier than I use a browser on pc!

I LOVE this app! It is so perfect for on-the-go booking. We are backpacking across Europe and have booked every hostel/hotel with this app. It allows you to easily select the date of arrival, how many nights, and number of people in the party and see all available results for your criteria... Something that is surprisingly difficult on other websites. One of the BEST features of this app is that it keeps the details of all of your booked hotels so you can easily access any of the information, including a google map location of it! It even also you to add the details automatically to your iPhone calendar!! Awesome app and it's FREE!!
Version 4.4 2012-03-30 4

They helped me when I made a mistake on date for a none refundable room at Heathrow airport. Thought I was going to lose $75 and still have to get another room at a much higher rate. I was very pleased to get the date and a great rate. We have used it for our trip to Europe and are very pleased.

Definitely the best rate
Version 4.3.1 2012-02-28 4
سعره نفس الحجز عن طريق الفندق مباشرة الا اذا كانت هناك عروض فلاش
واكثر الفنادق اذا شافوا حجزك عن طريق البوكينج انواع التطفيش والاستهبال والتاخير اتمنا معالجة هذه النقطة
من اسوأ الفنادق من ناحية هذه النقطة **فتدق دبليو الدوحة** سي جدا جدا من ناحية الخدمة
حيث كل شي تدفعه الان او بيخصم من الفيزا
باقي الفنادق الدفع عند التشك اوت
افضل فندق صرلحة ريتز كارلتون فينكال دبي واوريكسي روتانا الدوحة
ايضا الحجز عن طريق المكاتب السياحية ارخص وافضل

I have the Kayak app too. Today I was looking at hotels at the same date, brand and locations. I compared them to Kayak; I found that this app was at least $10 or more cheaper on the same hotels.

Easy to navigate, intuitive and decent rates make it a great app for leisure or business travel.
Version 4.2.1 2012-02-21 3
Selection is very comprehensive.  Prices seem comparable to other discount sites though the first price quoted which lures me to the particular property is not necessarily reflective of the most popular type of rooms that I choose such as a queen or king size room/bed.
Version 4.3.1 2012-02-21 5
I own a travel business that takes small groups to Italy. I use booking.com almost exclusively to find and book the hotels and other places my groups stay in. It's perfect because I can cancel rooms close to last minute if I have to make changes to the group. It's also easy to compare places, make sure they are in the right neighborhood by using the map feature, and read reviews from other people. I have never been disappointed using this app for booking my business and personal locations.
Version 4.2.1 2012-02-20 4
I would give this a 5-star only if the booking dates can be fixed. It is difficult to choose a date because the numbers don't fit in the box for choosing dates.
Version 4.3.1 2012-02-20 5
Great app!

I am an American living in Germany, and travel quite frequently. This app is fantastic and I have used it every single time I have needed to make hotel reservations. The app also helps with the language barrier, as I can know exactly what to expect from each hotel I book because all of the hotel info is in English. Thank you booking.com, this app is something I cannot travel without!
Version 4.3.1 2012-01-10 5

I have used booking.com to reserve hotels for previous vacations and have only had positive experiences for excellent prices. I just downloaded this app and found it to be even more helpful; once I booked my hotel, the app offered me an easy, button-press option to save the dates in my phone calendar, save the booking details as an image for easy access later, and/or plan my route. What pleasant and useful integration!
Version 4.3.1 2012-01-07 5
Отлично!

The 1st time I tried it, in the Dallas, TX area, it did not allow me to limit the search to under $100, plus it did not even bother to list hotels that offer rooms for under $100. As such, the search info returned is biased at best. I am deleting this useless app!
Version 4.2.1 2011-12-29 5
It is refreshing to use an app with an interface so well thought out and working so cleanly. Better than even the desktop website.

'Best price guaranteed'... False.. Out of the many hotel finders; quite disappointing..offering very few options, & ridiculous pricing...   especially if you are a pet owner. After comparing several apps... This one is worthless.. Try Price Negotiator, Expedia, or Hotels.com for a great price! No joke

Was doing a trip through New England and it beat out the stuff online! Easy and love it shows the available places based on the location I put in. GREAT APP!
Version 4.2.1 2011-12-17 5
I typically use Expedia or Tripadvisor but both of their apps are terrible.... Was using the booking.com website and was directed to this app and gave it a try... The filter feature is good and doesn't crowd the screen, instead the map showing the locations of only the hotels in your filter results is REALLY useful especially when you don't know much about the area that ou are traveling to...  Will ONLY use this app in the future
Version 4.2.1 2011-12-17 5

I was recently traveling in Tokyo on business and needed a last-minute hotel reservation. I asked my Japanese business associate to suggest a hotel in the area. While he went to the bathroom I found the Booking.com app. Faster than he could use the fully automated Toto Wash-let, I downloaded it, chose my area, number of nights, persons per room, viewed pictures, read customer reviews, booked my hotel and had a confirmation email sent to me! Chottomatte! (wait a moment!), Unbelievably easy booking was one thing but that's not all! The description, pictures of the hotel, customer comments and ratings were all right on! This was the best hotel I stayed at in all my years in Tokyo! Much better than the hotel recommendations made by my Japanese business associates! I will definitely use this app on my next hotel booking. Booking.com is Ichiban!

Good site , plenty of choice very reasonable price. The best thing is you dont have to pay a cent until you are there. And you have until 2 days before arrival to cancel or else they charge you a night which is very very fare. The other good thing there is a whole list of hotels all over the world.
Version 4.1.1 2011-11-22 5
I think it's amazing online booking program ...
But it have one thing that should give it to thier customers ... 

Sometime I want to booking from website but I have not credit card , for this reasone I would to give me choice to payment at the hotel when I have arriving to there ..**

Thanks a lot ..

Wow!  Glad I did NOT rely on this app. I am checking into a Washington DC hotel with a rate of $199 per night. They have more rooms available at that rate. I was just curious about this app so I searched DC. It showed my hotel with a best rate of $388 per night. Really? Doe a favor Booking.com, don't help!!

Excellent, site, very much mimics the same functionality as the website. I did find some issues with reservng rooms for 4 people in one room and finding out when I arrived at the hotel that the reservation came through as 2 adults and 2 kids. The app clearly says 4 adults. Watch out or you will pay double!

Think the apps UI is great but have you seen the prices. I checked with different websites namely Kayak and it blew the doors of this app prices. So in my opinion this app is just a novelty but you need to work on the prices for the hotel if you wanna stay in business in this economy. And so far app like this come and go but no one has come close to kayak's prices generally speaking. I had down loaded this app and within 30 min I deleted it, after checking prices for Miami,fl and Las Vegas, NV

ايضا لا يوجد خيار للبحث عن المنتجعات، فقط الفنادق، واضطر للدخول الى المنتجع في بوكنج عن طريق جوجل

تحياتي 

Of the most beautiful applications, told me a lot, and easy to use
Shame on the site that he does not have updated pictures of hotels is inaccurate
Also there is no option to search for resorts, hotels only, and was forced to enter the resort in Booking by Google

Great app so far. Makes finding and booking ur trip easy. And very secure! Took me about 10 min. to read reviews on the hotels look at the pics. and compare prices to find one i liked and then like 2 to book. And i got three nights in San diego for less than 200 dollars at a hotel that usually charges 100 a night. Pretty awesome.
Version 3.3 2011-10-06 5
Found an affordable room in Paris at a great location. 
This app let us book and confirm, then put a digital copy of confirmation in photos. Map shows where hotel is and photos of hotel are useful too. There are even guest reviews. 
The only drawback is directions to hotel are only useful if driving. We'll have to find our own way via train and subway. 
Still, A must have app!

Have several apps for hotel reservation, and most were lackluster with the need to order and charge your credit card ahead of time, but this apps does what I need it to do...BOOK
Version 4.0 2011-09-24 5
Very easy to use.  It saved all my information from last time ( except credit card) and allowed me to add to my calendar with one tap. Dig it! 

And the price was right on.

I adore what you are doing guys and ladies :D. 
I just have a suggestion. If by example I want to book a night at the same day at 00:00hrs, I can't do that. I have to book for the next day. You know sometimes you want to crash in somewhere at the last moment so it will allow us to benefit from your amazing rates. Thank you tonzzzzzzz

البرنامج جيد جداً فقط يحتاج الى تعديل الخريطة بشكل اكبر و جعله اكثر دقة في اسماء المناطق و المدن و اسماء القرى و اضافة شريط المسافة بمعنى خط يبين المسافة من منطقة لاخرى حتى يسهل على المستخدم حساب المسافة التي سيقطعها
فمثلاً ساحجز في فندق و الفندق كم يبعد عن الحرم المكي بالمتر او بالكيلو متر و هكذا...
Version 3.3 2011-08-28 5
Exhaustive listings with a lot of relevant, useful info for booking hotels -- reviews, photos, reservation details -- even in smaller towns. They don't charge a fee and the account feature, while slightly tricky to get your first reservation into, is useful. Amazing app.

I use many travel sites but for me Booking com seems to have an edge in Europe. I have made over a dozen last minute reservations and in every case I have found great deals and the reservation has also been on file and the hotel expecting me. It's my number one hotel app for Europe. Always check Internet fees parking fees and meal plan costs. Enjoy

You can easily book. There are a lot of sort options with map views etc. Once you've booked you van press the button to send to a friend, auto add your booked dates to your iPad calendar, plan route or auto add image of booking to your camera.

This is what it's all about. Well done booking.com! While taking the ferry from the mainland to Samui I was able to find rooms, rates, and reviews with geolocale on loads of hotels. Booking was a snap. The only thing that's needed is for the cancelation details to be a little more clear. Some of them are a bit confusing. Aside from that... Great work!

A well thought out display that is easy to use and easy a good resource for information about properties.

I called the best western hotel to confirm my reservation and they said booking.com never sent it. Not only that, but they had already been sold out for 4 hours before I tried to book it, so the app never should have accepted it in the first place. Effectively, a useless, misleading app.
Version 3.3 2011-07-25 5
First time I have ever book a room and it was very easy. I'm 74 and I can't get over this iPhone and what it will do.!!!
Version 3.3 2011-07-25 5
Title says it all. They thought of everything!  Save reservation to iPhoto album in my iPhone...really, now. That's got to be a first, and terrific when I don't have a printer to print to. Who wants the extra paper, anyway?
Thanks, guys.

البوكينج موقع لا يحتاج لتقييم فهو الموقع الاول والرائد والذي سهل على الكثير من الناس حجز الفنادق حول العالم بل والحصول على اسعار منافسة والمقارنة بين الفنادق قبيل الحجز من نواحي عدة منها السعر والفخامة والخدمات وتقييم المستخدمين
فقط يحتاج لتطوير من ناحية تصميم التطبيق مع انه رائع الآن الى اننا نطمح للمزيد

I have other apps for hotels but this is by far the best. It works very seamlessly and intuitively with the iPad, taking great advantage of all the iPad's features and capabilities. Sometimes it seems that some of the prices are higher than other sites, so check it out throughly. Otherwise, this is a 5 star app, definitely.

El First HoTel SKT Petri de Copenague tiene una excelente ubicacion y un magnifico desayuno buffet......y nada mas!!!!
La decoracion del Lobby es horrible.
Los cuartos estan mal decorados, huelen a humedad y estan sucios los baños.
Cuando llueve fuerte , el agua se mete  a los cuartos inundandolos peligrosamente. El agua pasa por los conductos de las luces. Existe un problema estructural y de construccion de ductos.
El personal trata de resolver los problemas pero  falta personal en todos lados del Hotel.
No vendan el Hotel como una maravilla pues es ruidoso y pico seguro

This has made my time alone wandering Greece so much easier. It would be an additional help to have an overlay of transportation maps, like metros & buses on the maps. It is helpful to be able to save my reservations in several places as I don't travel with a printer. Thanks.

I use travel websites constantly and find this service to provide best prices with user-friendly layout.  And they don't charge your credit card.  Your credi card is used to hold the reservation and then you present your card and fee is charged when you check in to your hotel.

I've found this app to be really good at finding the cheapest hotel bookings and the ipad app functions really smoothly and so quickly. when the app tells you it takes two minutes to book, it isn't kidding!
Version 3.2 2011-04-30 1
Have to get on line to set up, not super easy
Version 3.2 2011-04-30 4
The people who designed this app did a really good job on the small things. For example, in the credit card field the keyboard defaults to numeric, rather than making you switch from alpha, and it displays the cc number in chunks of four, rather than jamming all sixteen digits together, making it easier to read. These things sound trivial, but they really speed up the process and eliminate the aggravation usually associated with entering data on a phone or tablet. I wish all developers would take the time to execute this well.
Version 3.2 2011-04-30 4
I love the map view & picture viewer!  I would like a few features added- ability to save Favorites & open their webpage in Safari / email webpage link vs. a link to the app.
Version 3.2 2011-04-30 2
We have already established our vacation and travel stays prior to running this app. ... Thank God.  This program has no U.S. Data base for hotels.  Waste of time

A little improvement will make the app even better. E.g. Instead of limiting the search to cities, sometimes it's better to expand the search to countries. Especially when we can't decide which city to visit.

I tried couple apps when I was looking a hotel for ma vacation, and found that this is the best one. very convenient and has everything that you would like to know about hotels inside the app. Has large amount of reviews and photos.
The only one drawback that I have found is that it doesn't index ALL available hotels. But anyway it has more hotels than the other apps and gives you much better user experience than other applications of this class.

Best app. For content quality and ease of use ....have used it for a long time and nothing beats it for my money; best feature is a booking without having to face a charge on your cc ( some hotels do have a policy which differs BUT, for the most part,  the Booking . Com policy rules .

Easy to find and book hotels. Even gives you rooms not found on hotel website. And what's best gives you available rather than every hotel in sight. 

Saved me from a dingy hotel in Rome while on my honeymoon. Just logged on to the app from the lobby and found a much nicer hotel just 5 minutes away.

As we have taken our vacation trip, Booking has been our go to app for hotels.  Where will we stop today?  Check the app and book a room.  Too easy.
Version 3.1 2011-04-04 5
Very useful & great app
Version 3.1 2011-04-04 5
Has almost the entire functionality of the booking.com website, but more functional. I especially like the way one can explore the hotels directly on the map, then bring them out as a numbered list. I would take off half a star maybe if I could for inability to translate reviews directly from the review, as the tripadvisor website does. Linking the reviews to google translator would be very useful.
Version 3.1 2011-04-03 1
Could have gotten same room $5 cheaper by booking myself. (I was in a hurry.) won't be using the APP again.
Version 3.1 2011-04-03 4

Version 3.1 2011-03-20 1
The prices they show as crossed out it seems like they made those numbers up to show more of a savings?.? They're way off. Check Caesars Palace in Vegas, go to their web site and compare prices and you'll understand what I mean. On this app it shows  $1,900 crossed out and booking.com price is around $715... That's basically the normal price you can get anywhere, it's actually cheaper through Caesars.  You can find better deals elsewhere. Really no savings here. 

Version 3.1 2011-03-18 3
The app only keeps track of what you book from the app. If you book it online, it does not sync with the app. It should, but it doesn't. So the app is just a search tool, which google or bing is better at.

I have used this app almost exclusively to plan our three week vacation to the States, and it has not let me down. It's fast, covers most hotels, and the customer reviews are essential to know what hotels to stay at. I have used this app, and the website,  for many a trip, and have never been let down. It helps you find the hidden gems you may otherwise have never known about!

The first time in which I opened this App I found a lot of amusement reading about a place in Chicago in which the word 'dirty' inevitably appeared alongside 'rude' in almost every review of a Michigan Ave hotel.  I thought,  "great ap,  I learned a lot here."
The subsequent searches in another area (Champaign-Urbana) brought up 1 hotel in an area with at least 25 hotels...  What the heck!  No matter what parimeters I used,  a Hilton for $285 a night was the only thing this App could find in a much cheaper than usual town.
Perhaps there is a fleece my butt mode that I have accidentally activated,  but that seems to be the only option which I have with this App anymore.
Version 3.0 2011-02-10 5

Version 3.0 2011-02-08 5
very useful, with a large selection of hotels worldwide, easy to use and helpful. A minor drawback is that it seems like one cannot sign in with a booking.com account inside this app, what is a little odd... but that's ok, you can do everything nevertheless.

Good app, but why can't you save favorite hotels in diff cities? Please add this feature. Most ppl rsrch multiple hotels first & narrow down later after all options explored. Also, want bookmarks to recommend good hotels found in various cities for future trips. Pls update & will change rating. Thanks.

I managed to use the app on the terribly slow gogo airplane wifi. So if it works here at 30,000 ft it will do a great job on the ground.
I'd like to see a couple of extra search criteria but I feel the same way about the regular on-line version as well. 
I use booking.com all the time and think it is a great booking site

This is really the best hotel reservation tool ever known. and because I am a poor planner, it happened twice that I decided to spend a night or two in another city, and all what I took is my car, small bag and an iPad. I made reservations from a coffee shop when I reached my destination. Then I just went to the hotel. ( some times you need to show them the reservation email since you will be reaching the hotel before the conformation)

Just got this app so far it's cool. It gives you pics of the hotel and pics of the rooms. To kinda give you an ideal of what your getting yourself into. But I'm not sure just yet so I'm gonna give it a 3 star rating.
Version 2.6.1 2010-12-22 5
Very impressed with this app. Selection of lodging is limited but enough variety for our budget. Much easier than other hotel booking apps I've used. I really like that it defaults to today's date, 1 nite, and 2 people. Perfect for finding rooms while we are on the road, taking our route and timing changes in stride.
Version 2.6.1 2010-12-22 4

Please can you do in the facilities section a more detailed discription, like icons on your website for example, cuz I can't see if hotels have a free wi fi or breakfast or parking, cuz it's just list of all facilities and not so detailed as on a website.
Version 2.6.1 2010-12-21 2
Downloaded this app and thought it would be an excellent app for traveling. For the most part, it's not too bad, but I could never get it to adjust down with regards to pricing. It would adjust up to high prices, but never down. Did a search of a town that I know has 20+ hotels and all it would give me is (1). Bottom line is, glad I didn'tpay for it, so now it's it's deleted.

We booked some great hotels. Reviews were very important.
A major issue though, is to make sure that the default of same day reservation does not kick in and you accidentally book same day nonrefundable. Double check your dates. Triple check your dates. The iPad app worked well.
The maps load slow though. There should be a way to save a map to email for people running on wifi. We are in Belgium.
Maps would be a big help.

Version 2.5 2010-10-21 1
I live in Orlando FL. tried it on my area to see how it works. It located 2. In the hotel capital of the U.S only 2. Don't waste ur time. Try KAYAK it found 600 in a 30m radius.

The only people rating this app highly are likely those who have not seem any others.  This is pure trash, apparently supported by the hotels rated in the app. 

Lists only a handful of hotels in any area.  Example:  it shows 3 hotels for Cleveland (all $100+), where Hotelpal shows 50 or more. 

Sponsored garbage, masked as an independent travel aid.  They should be ashamed.
Version 2.5 2010-10-20 3
This app would be more useful and friendly if it also provided the phone number of the hotels. It provides the address and map, why not the phone number?
Version 2.5 2010-10-19 4
It's nice app. I use this for my trip
Version 2.5 2010-10-19 5
The best app for travel
Version 2.5 2010-10-18 1
Useless!
Version 2.5 2010-10-16 5
the best app
Version 2.5 2010-10-16 5
I downloaded the app to compare with kayak and this just blew it away! Had to book a hotel for 1 night right as I was getting on the plane. by the time I landed I had received the confirmation while I was in the air. Only thing that needs improvement is the rating system. Ramada suites not a 3 star but  1 star.

Version 2.4.1 2010-09-18 1
Crappy app, told me there was one hotel in the city I'm in. There must be at least 100 here. Don't waste your time
Version 2.4 2010-09-14 5

Very helpful and easy to use!!!!

You can not choose the number of rooms 

No filter to choose with swimming pool or breakfast
Version 2.3 2010-09-02 5
Sem dúvidas é o melhor do ramo.

Completo, muito bem planejado o que torna a navegação muito simples e eficiente, alem da inteligente funcão de fazer buscas a partir do mapa (e a função localização é bem precisa). 

Super recomendado!!
Version 2.3 2010-08-28 1
This is no where near as slick as Hotelpal. I've used a few of these apps. Hotel pal has more hotels. The rates seem the same.
Version 2.3 2010-08-26 1
No hotels?!?
Version 2.3 2010-08-26 3
Easy to use!
Version 2.3 2010-08-21 5
The app is amazingly nice and easy to use. I really recommend it to everyone uses the web to book for hotels. I like the fact that it allows you to save an image of you booking details in your photo library. Go ahead and download you want regret it.
Version 2.3 2010-08-18 5
I really like the app. Just used it to book three different hotels for an upcoming biz trip, and it was delightfully simple and intuitive. My only request for future versions is that I would like to see the average customer rating along with the hotel's star rating. This would have made my searching go a bit quicker. I applaud the other features, eg saving an image of the booking details, etc. I have used Booking almost exclusively for 5 years now, and I am a very satisfied customer.

Thins booking.com (:
Version 2.2 2010-07-27 5
Just to virtualing visitors of hotels
Version 2.2 2010-07-19 5
The best thing ever is to check the hotel location so you could book the one near to the attraction you need , for example I book the nearest hotel to the metro station ;)
Version 2.2 2010-07-14 5
Best booking app
Version 2.2 2010-07-14 1

Version 2.2 2010-07-12 1
I thought this app was very handy---until I showed up at the hotel, and they had NO RECORD of my booking! And the hotel was totally booked! Slick interface and easy to use, but worse than useless if the booking doesn't go through. I had my confirmation email from Booking.com, but no reservation.
Version 2.2 2010-07-11 1
I have used other applications to book my rooms and by far this is the most expensive of them all.
Version 2.1 2010-07-05 5
I have always used booking.com's website to make my travel arrangements. The app is fast and in many ways better than the website even! I have tried Kayak and other apps as well. This is the best so far.
Version 2.1 2010-07-01 5
Just downloaded  it and completed my first booking!
Version 2.1 2010-06-21 4
Great app, with all basic resources you look for. The booking process is very straight forward and fast.
Version 2.1 2010-06-16 1
There is no way to change the keyboard language. On my ipad the keyboard appears in Greek and not let me change it.
Version 2.0 2010-06-14 1
It only gaves the name of the city, followed by "Unites Sates of America" and does not tells you in which STATE it is!! How many "plymouth" are there in USA!?!?!
Version 1.1 2010-05-19 5
Very nice app with great information and clean design.

Excellent way to find the best hotel pricing.  I'm a fan.
Version 1.0 2010-04-14 5
Just discovered this new app today while looking for a nearby hotel. I was impressed by the way the hotel listings integrate seamlessly with the map view. Easy and fast to find the right hotel.
