originally, the idea was to prototype this text summarizing work in python and then rewrite in c/c++
may possibly do rewrite in R instead (possibly a speed benefit, as well as packages available to reduce
amount of manual work). would like to eventually eliminate python portion of scraper and rewrite in bash
this would limit number of languages to two (R, bash)

main r packages to use:
    -openNLP
    (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openNLP/)
    - this will be used for tokenization, POS tagging, and hopefully removal of stop words and other
      unneeded elements (haven't check on capability of opennlp on this last part)
    - have to run the following line in addition
    install.packages("openNLPmodels.en", repos="http://datacube.wu.ac.at/", type="source")

    -arules
    (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arules/index.html)
    - this will be used for association mining

    -tm
    - possibly use this for any other needed functionality
