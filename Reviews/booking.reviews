 (A traveler's aid) I first used this app when I was traveling across country without a route or itinerary. When I knew about where I was ready to stop, I pulled up the app and looked for rooms along my way.

Based on customer comments and reviews, I chose a VERY reasonably priced hotel that had me somewhat concerned. The brand isn't known for its amenities, etc. but I trusted the reviewers.

I have never been more pleased with a room. It was everything I demand in a room and a lot of things I hope for. The most important criteria on this particular night was quiet. I was tired and the hotel was near the interstate and downtown. Reviewers said how quiet it was and were so right. 

I have been a convert and regular user ever since. I LOVE and trust this app.

 (I like it but...) I try to use this app all the time and it works great with no glitchy things. But, I am one of those people who like to filter and filter until I have exactly the pool of hotels I want to look at and the app doesn't seem to do that, so I end up accessing booking.com through the website.

It's simplified travel planning for us and since we tend to be "seat of your pants" travelers, that's huge!   Highly highly recommend this app!

Version 6.0 1
 (Buyer Beware) Extraordinarily misleading booking process and policies.  When booking a hotel room, app does not clearly display all terms and conditions prior to completion of booking.  
False claim # 1 - credit card information is requested just to reserve the room.  Fact - room was charged/pre-paid for full amount upon completion of booking 
False claim #2 - you may cancel room up to 3 days prior to arrival without penalty.  I tried to cancel booking the same day (had accidentally booked the wrong location) and app/service was going to charge me the full amount.  When I called customer service, rep said they would try to call the hotel to refund the charge; rep put me on hold briefly (too briefly to have made any calls on my behalf) and came back and said, sorry - wasn't able to reach the person at the hotel who has the authority to reverse the charge; try calling again later.  If I could rate this app/booking service less than 1 Star, I would.

 (Best hotel app PERIOD!) Not only does this app rival priceline bids (it's sister company) but what makes it 100x better is the pay when you arrive part.

Well I finally got one that stood up to the challenge. I was having a button or conformation issue online. I said I bet it's a app for this, came here and bamm what a beautiful easy way to book a room!!! Showed pics with ease and to top it off when I got my room validation key it looked like a real key going into a key slot. I 💖 it!!!!! Definitely the bet way to go!!!

Version 5.9.1 1
 (Does not remember any dates from prev launch) Beware: This app will annoy you with random crashes. Moreover it does not store your previous search dates. Use web site is safer for your brain.

Version 5.9.1 4
 (Pretty decent, but....) I wish the app gave the same functionality as the website. On the site I can do searches for multiple rooms with differing numbers of people in the room. Can't do that with the app. Otherwise, it's well done!

Version 5.9.1 5

 (Great app) This app helps my family make reservations on the fly without having to make calls and get on the web. We get great prices at our finger tips. I love it and use it on every family trip.

Version 5.9.1 2
 (Too hard to contact) I needed to change my booking. The website wouldn't allow the change, so I wanted to talk to someone. No luck finding a number to call. I had to cancel my booking and then work directly with the hotel. Fortunately they were nice and the same price. Probably will not use again.

 (Amazing!) This is crazy handy to be able to book rooms right when I think of it instead of needing to wait to get to a computer. Makes things much easier!

Version 5.9.1 5
 (Easy to use and effective) We just used this tool on a 2 week trip across Northern Europe, selecting hotels the day before arriving in a town or city. It was easy to use, accurate, and gave good info. Filters were also helpful. My one suggestion for enhancement is to be able to add a key location to a map (e.g., "near the train station" or "near city center") to facilitate selection. Thanks, bookings.com, you really made our trip work!

Version 5.9.1 4
 (Great app!) I'm currently using this app on a trip to SE Asia. So far no problems except one with the booking process with hotels, but that was the computer's fault, not booking.com.  Easy to use, it saves your credit card info for easy booking and people's reviews were helpful.  The only negative was that I wish you could save maps and directions to offline.  Oftentimes when I needed the app to find the place I didn't have internet.

Version 5.9 5

Version 5.9 5
 (Good App) Easy to use

Version 5.9 3
 (Perfect for adults) The booking app does not have a field for entering children and their ages into the search.  Families with children will have to use the web site portal to enter in children.  This renders the app nearly useless for families.

Other wise, it is the perfect app.  Add children capability and I will give it 5 stars.

 (Forget all the rest!) Booking.com makes all the other booking sites obsolete.  Take two minutes to create an account with just your email address and a password, and get 50% off at choice hotels.  Give them a try to find out all the other reasons why Booking.com is the best, most user friendly booking site.

Version 5.8 5
 (Changes on the fly) I was able to make relatively very good hotel choices given all the info and reviews, and was able to find rooms very short notice. Just think if I was a good planner I could get even better. Always read as many reviews for each hotel and see if maybe other factors affect people's opinions Iike, it's a two star in a bad section of Paris and its high summer. What do you really expect, for example.

 (absolutely love it) I this this is the best, already booked hostel in Prague and a few in Poland for Christmas. a wide choice of accomodation and, what I love most, they calculate the price immediately! but one thing should be here: search ranging by several criteria, for example, the cheapest and closest to the center. now you can choose only either the cheapest or closest to the center.

 (Rediculois !!!) As a traveling business owner i dont have time to write reviews but This app is ridiculously awesome.  Was able to secure both a rental car and hotel during a fast plane layover from my phone, at prices that exceeded my expectations. Almost too easy.  All info saves to my calendar and images confirmations to my photo library.  Was able to share with colleagues in a snap.  Obviously this one was truly designed with the customers ease-of-use in mind.

Version 5.7.1 5
 (Super helpful!) Made looking for a room easy. You get to look at a variety of hotels and there are no surprises. Saved me a ton of money.

Version 5.6.2 4
 (Good) Useful but keep in mind, you're only reserving your room when you use your card, not paying for it. You pay when you actually get to the hotel and they always add fees and taxes. So count on paying about $50-$100 more than what's asvertised. It's all in the fine print.

 (Excellent) Excellent and useful program

Version 5.6.2 2
 (Good prices -read reviews) Overall the app is handy. Some good deals can be found BUT there are issues. First , the hotel descriptions
Usually make no reference to pet-friendliness. Making a call to each hotel to find out if they accept pets defeats the purpose of the app. Secondly, the rating system is way off. Read the reviews of the hotels before you book. We booked a room based on a great rating to then read the review that made  the hotel out to be a dump. After check in we found out the review of dump was right, the rating was way off. Beware!

Version 5.7.1 4

Version 5.7 5
 (Good) I liked it

Version 5.7 5
 (Best booking experience ever) There's not much to say-this app is the best booking experience you can imagine. Found myself clicking around and enjoying it for hours. Needless to say we are trying to book as much as we can via this app. They have done a great job imagining what people need when they are looking for hotels, the information architecture / tools at hand deserve standing ovations.

With every update it seems things get even better. Now with plenty of mobile integration like passbook. There's only one thing to complain about: please also add flight booking. Then I wouldn't have to use anything else. Great app, seriously.

Version 5.7 5
 (Muy útil) Fácil de usar y muy eficiente para la búsqueda y sugerencia, sobre todo buenos precios, muy útil.

Version 5.7 5
 (So helpful!) I've been looking at hotels for a trip to New York for 3 weeks and was feeling discouraged since everything was so expensive. We even called our timeshare for help. Spent my hour lunch break searching through the listings and have found 7 reasonable options including apartments that fit our group of 6 instead of booking 2 hotel rooms and they have kitchens! So now my bank account won't suffer as much! Best app ever!

Version 4.7.1 5

Version 5.6.2 5
 (Happy) Nice site to help for vacation and see the world

Version 5.7 5
 (Well designed, easy to use) Decent search functions, okay filters, but killer pricing.  Much better than booking directly with some of the higher-end hotels.  Probably a good way for hotels to unload some of their excess capacity, without directly discounting their rack rate (which many business travelers likely pay).  Kudos to the app, the underlying software and business model.

Version 5.6.2 5

 (The best booking app) Easy finder for best hotels and fast booking.
However one missing option: search for a hotel when you are in a precise location; you can scroll, sort but cant search by typing the hotel name.

It would be great for the upgrade to have it.

 (Deleted this app) Last night I was trying to book a room.  Every time I attempted to complete my booking, the App would tell me that one of the data items I entered was missing or invalid.  I corrected things repeatedly and after 30 minutes of these problems I gave up and booked elsewhere.  I am deleting the app - just go through safari to the regular web site.  It is faster an easier.
