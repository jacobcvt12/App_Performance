 (A traveler's aid) I first used this app when I was traveling across country without a route or itinerary. When I knew about where I was ready to stop, I pulled up the app and looked for rooms along my way.

Based on customer comments and reviews, I chose a VERY reasonably priced hotel that had me somewhat concerned. The brand isn't known for its amenities, etc. but I trusted the reviewers.

I have never been more pleased with a room. It was everything I demand in a room and a lot of things I hope for. The most important criteria on this particular night was quiet. I was tired and the hotel was near the interstate and downtown. Reviewers said how quiet it was and were so right. 

I have been a convert and regular user ever since. I LOVE and trust this app.

 (I like it but...) I try to use this app all the time and it works great with no glitchy things. But, I am one of those people who like to filter and filter until I have exactly the pool of hotels I want to look at and the app doesn't seem to do that, so I end up accessing booking.com through the website.

Version 6.0 1
 (Buyer Beware) Extraordinarily misleading booking process and policies.  When booking a hotel room, app does not clearly display all terms and conditions prior to completion of booking.  
False claim # 1 - credit card information is requested just to reserve the room.  Fact - room was charged/pre-paid for full amount upon completion of booking 
False claim #2 - you may cancel room up to 3 days prior to arrival without penalty.  I tried to cancel booking the same day (had accidentally booked the wrong location) and app/service was going to charge me the full amount.  When I called customer service, rep said they would try to call the hotel to refund the charge; rep put me on hold briefly (too briefly to have made any calls on my behalf) and came back and said, sorry - wasn't able to reach the person at the hotel who has the authority to reverse the charge; try calling again later.  If I could rate this app/booking service less than 1 Star, I would.

 (Best hotel app PERIOD!) Not only does this app rival priceline bids (it's sister company) but what makes it 100x better is the pay when you arrive part.

Well I finally got one that stood up to the challenge. I was having a button or conformation issue online. I said I bet it's a app for this, came here and bamm what a beautiful easy way to book a room!!! Showed pics with ease and to top it off when I got my room validation key it looked like a real key going into a key slot. I 💖 it!!!!! Definitely the bet way to go!!!

Version 5.9.1 1
 (Does not remember any dates from prev launch) Beware: This app will annoy you with random crashes. Moreover it does not store your previous search dates. Use web site is safer for your brain.

Version 5.9.1 4
 (Pretty decent, but....) I wish the app gave the same functionality as the website. On the site I can do searches for multiple rooms with differing numbers of people in the room. Can't do that with the app. Otherwise, it's well done!

Version 5.9.1 5

 (Great app) This app helps my family make reservations on the fly without having to make calls and get on the web. We get great prices at our finger tips. I love it and use it on every family trip.

Version 5.9.1 2
 (Too hard to contact) I needed to change my booking. The website wouldn't allow the change, so I wanted to talk to someone. No luck finding a number to call. I had to cancel my booking and then work directly with the hotel. Fortunately they were nice and the same price. Probably will not use again.

 (Amazing!) This is crazy handy to be able to book rooms right when I think of it instead of needing to wait to get to a computer. Makes things much easier!

Version 5.9.1 5
 (Easy to use and effective) We just used this tool on a 2 week trip across Northern Europe, selecting hotels the day before arriving in a town or city. It was easy to use, accurate, and gave good info. Filters were also helpful. My one suggestion for enhancement is to be able to add a key location to a map (e.g., "near the train station" or "near city center") to facilitate selection. Thanks, bookings.com, you really made our trip work!

Version 5.9.1 4
 (Great app!) I'm currently using this app on a trip to SE Asia. So far no problems except one with the booking process with hotels, but that was the computer's fault, not booking.com.  Easy to use, it saves your credit card info for easy booking and people's reviews were helpful.  The only negative was that I wish you could save maps and directions to offline.  Oftentimes when I needed the app to find the place I didn't have internet.

Version 5.9 5

Version 5.9 5
 (Good App) Easy to use

Version 5.9 3
 (Perfect for adults) The booking app does not have a field for entering children and their ages into the search.  Families with children will have to use the web site portal to enter in children.  This renders the app nearly useless for families.

Other wise, it is the perfect app.  Add children capability and I will give it 5 stars.

 (Forget all the rest!) Booking.com makes all the other booking sites obsolete.  Take two minutes to create an account with just your email address and a password, and get 50% off at choice hotels.  Give them a try to find out all the other reasons why Booking.com is the best, most user friendly booking site.

Version 5.8 5
 (Changes on the fly) I was able to make relatively very good hotel choices given all the info and reviews, and was able to find rooms very short notice. Just think if I was a good planner I could get even better. Always read as many reviews for each hotel and see if maybe other factors affect people's opinions Iike, it's a two star in a bad section of Paris and its high summer. What do you really expect, for example.

 (absolutely love it) I this this is the best, already booked hostel in Prague and a few in Poland for Christmas. a wide choice of accomodation and, what I love most, they calculate the price immediately! but one thing should be here: search ranging by several criteria, for example, the cheapest and closest to the center. now you can choose only either the cheapest or closest to the center.

 (Rediculois !!!) As a traveling business owner i dont have time to write reviews but This app is ridiculously awesome.  Was able to secure both a rental car and hotel during a fast plane layover from my phone, at prices that exceeded my expectations. Almost too easy.  All info saves to my calendar and images confirmations to my photo library.  Was able to share with colleagues in a snap.  Obviously this one was truly designed with the customers ease-of-use in mind.

Version 5.7.1 5
 (Super helpful!) Made looking for a room easy. You get to look at a variety of hotels and there are no surprises. Saved me a ton of money.

Version 5.6.2 4
 (Good) Useful but keep in mind, you're only reserving your room when you use your card, not paying for it. You pay when you actually get to the hotel and they always add fees and taxes. So count on paying about $50-$100 more than what's asvertised. It's all in the fine print.

 (Excellent) Excellent and useful program

Version 5.6.2 2
 (Good prices -read reviews) Overall the app is handy. Some good deals can be found BUT there are issues. First , the hotel descriptions
Usually make no reference to pet-friendliness. Making a call to each hotel to find out if they accept pets defeats the purpose of the app. Secondly, the rating system is way off. Read the reviews of the hotels before you book. We booked a room based on a great rating to then read the review that made  the hotel out to be a dump. After check in we found out the review of dump was right, the rating was way off. Beware!

Version 5.7.1 4

Version 5.7 5
 (Good) I liked it

Version 5.7 5
 (Best booking experience ever) There's not much to say-this app is the best booking experience you can imagine. Found myself clicking around and enjoying it for hours. Needless to say we are trying to book as much as we can via this app. They have done a great job imagining what people need when they are looking for hotels, the information architecture / tools at hand deserve standing ovations.

With every update it seems things get even better. Now with plenty of mobile integration like passbook. There's only one thing to complain about: please also add flight booking. Then I wouldn't have to use anything else. Great app, seriously.

Version 5.7 5
 (Muy útil) Fácil de usar y muy eficiente para la búsqueda y sugerencia, sobre todo buenos precios, muy útil.

Version 5.7 5
 (So helpful!) I've been looking at hotels for a trip to New York for 3 weeks and was feeling discouraged since everything was so expensive. We even called our timeshare for help. Spent my hour lunch break searching through the listings and have found 7 reasonable options including apartments that fit our group of 6 instead of booking 2 hotel rooms and they have kitchens! So now my bank account won't suffer as much! Best app ever!

Version 4.7.1 5

Version 5.6.2 5
 (Happy) Nice site to help for vacation and see the world

Version 5.7 5
 (Well designed, easy to use) Decent search functions, okay filters, but killer pricing.  Much better than booking directly with some of the higher-end hotels.  Probably a good way for hotels to unload some of their excess capacity, without directly discounting their rack rate (which many business travelers likely pay).  Kudos to the app, the underlying software and business model.

Version 5.6.2 5

However one missing option: search for a hotel when you are in a precise location; you can scroll, sort but cant search by typing the hotel name.

It would be great for the upgrade to have it.

I corrected things repeatedly and after 30 minutes of these problems I gave up and booked elsewhere.  I am deleting the app - just go through safari to the regular web site.  It is faster an easier.

 (77.2mb not 43.5mb and what a waste of an app.) Really no deals, App is painfully over bloated for its size and lack of features. Why need an app???, When functions online even on mobile browsers are way better and the deals too. Use my phone space?, Justify it with some value. You will find no value here.

 (Nice, clean, fast - but the map's a bit too small...) I have been a user of Booking.com since years, and really appreciate their easy service. This app does that too, and makes booking quick and easy. Just, when I'm looking for a hotel near a certain place, or want to see a greater area around my destination, the map that's there is a weeeee bit small... 
Otherwise, works. What more can I say.

 (Terrible) If you want me to use your site or e mobile app you have to make it possible for me to download my confirmation to my IPad. It's supposed to be possible but there are NO instructions and my own attempts to figure it out were futile. I haven't got all day to figure this out or several days to wait for you to get back to me. I'm deleting this app.

Version 5.5 5
 (👍👍👍) اكثر من رائع

Version 5.5 4
 (Great app) I saw a comment stating that this app was good when not near a computer and that is so true.  I'm in an airport and have just booked several nights in different hotels while on a last minute vacation out west.  Also this app is nice for when you do book online via your PC, all your confirmation numbers, hotel names, addresses, and phone numbers are with you on your phone via the app. Something else that I noticed today, I forgot to sign in so when I was ready to book my room, I was able to login directly.  It saved my reservation request and pre-populated everything with my information.

 (Filtros) Necessário incluir mais filtros, do tipo que a versão on line tem, como por exemplo bairros, WIfi, etc. O mapa também precisa de melhorias. Além disso, a confirmação da reserva deveria conter detalhes do tipo de quarto reservado, evitando assim confusões no check in.

 (❤ This app) On a month-long cross-country trip in summer 2012, I stumbled across this app. Serendipity! 
   We've been using it ever since to save money on chain hotels (lots of super last-minute deals.) But best of all, it finds those quaint, quirky and totally unique motels and small hotels. Without this app, they are very difficult to find and book.
  Great service app!

 (One little change would be nice) I wish you could use the search bar to search directly for hotels and not just locations (cities, regions, islands, etc). Because sometimes the hotel name is much easier to remember than the particular province it's in. And the website works like that so it would be nice for the app to allow it as we'll. otherwise, very good app and company.

Please add the following to make it even better: 

- add room size to filters, e.g. I would prefer set minimum room size for not to see 4-5 star hotels with small or tiny rooms

- add room floor plan to have better idea of what is the room layout

- add possibility to give hotel chain loyalty card number in the booking form

Thanks!

 (Don't use an external Keyboard) The app is OK, if you use the iPads onscreen keyboard, but if you use a bluetooth keyboard, the app gets all messed up and can not process your booking. When you submit, it moves you items around so it will not process your order because it thinks you didn't type in the correct information. It needs fixed, other than that is works well.

I am deleting it now...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME

 (Great rAte ! ****) This app is a great app because it books your hotel for you and you do not pay until you get there and you also have a choice with many of the hotels to cancel your reservation meaning if you don't like the place you don't have to stay in unlike Travelocity and Priceline to charge you a huge fee just to set you up in around you can get that room for the same price with this app and not get charged so you're saving a lot more money I travel a lot and I honestly love this site!

 (All apps should be this easy to use!) Need a hotel, apartment or vacation house? This app is a great way to find, view and book them! I wish all apps would be this intuitive and easy to use!

Version 5.2 5
 (Simply the best) I've used many apps and websites to book my hotels when I travel and this one is simply the best. Unless some of other websites they show the full price of the rooms for the total stay (usually including taxes etc, except for some countries). the map feature is very useful to locate the hotel or find another hotel in the same area.  It is possible to save the booking confirmation directly in the iPad calendar along with a picture of the confirmation (in the picture folder). A really useful and easy to use app and I prefer to book my hotels with it rather than my computer.

 (Unreliable) Booked a hotel using the app, arrived at the hotel only to find out that the hotel is closed. To be fair this was after the storm Sandy in NJ when a lot of places didn't have power which is probably why the hotel was closed but why say only 2 more rooms left.

 (Stands out among many) The bottom line: this app gets 5 stars for a great user experience and great products.

There are so many hotel booking apps but this one stands among them all. Most apps allow you to see the hotels on a list view where you can see the limited details or on a map view with no details until you tap them (except for maybe name and price). This map shows both at once allowing you to see some of the details and the map at the same time. This is really helpful when the selection is large but location is really important to you (like when looking in NYC). This view isn't hard to read either because it displays the hotels in the current view of the list with a blue marker while showing all the other hotels in the result as smaller white markers. Moreover, I searched for a week trying to find a really affordable but nice hotel in NYC during the holidays for my anniversary, which seemed like an impossible task, but I found one for $250/night right near Times Square! I thought there surely had to be a catch but there wasn't. I am thoroughly impressed.

Version 5.1 5
 (So thorough and easy!) I swear this is the easiest hotel booking I've ever made! This app is so convenient, and the designers included everything you need for easy booking. I routed my trip, saved the image of the booking details to my smartphone and saved the trip to my phone's calendar all from the app!!! After being highly disappointed with some of the most popular booking sites, this was a breath of fresh air. Thank you!!!

 (Mr) Save money, time and be sure to book at the hotel you want. This app is as much part of my traveling as the airfare I buy. I can't book without it anymore. Keep it up!

Version 5.0 5
 (One small bug!) I've used this in several countries and states, and it is awesome! The one small bug is where one chooses the check-in day. I always have to choose the day after I wish in order for the correct day to show up. Weird. I don't mind because now I know, but this bug makes it easy to book a day earlier than desired! Some places understand when a customer makes a mistake like this, but some (especially during peak season) will charge for the reserved night regardless. 

I also wish there were a way to easily rate hotels/motels within the app. If there is a way, I'm unaware of it.

Version 5.0 5

 (Seamless. Transparent. Excellent coverage.) I've used this site a number of times for reservations in USA, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Italy. Compared to competing internet sites it sometimes has slightly better prices. It is much easier to use than proprietary hotel sites and often has significantly better prices. I recently had to cancel an entire vacation itinerary and Bookings was by far the easiest to use in this regard. Because of this, it is now my first choice for travel arrangements.  My last booking was one handed on iPhone while driving... Doable, but next time I'll pull over!

 (Wow!) Just updating my old review to say this app only gets better. Love it.

I just came back from a trip abroad and got stranded at Newark Airport at 11:30 PM when our connecting flight was cancelled due to the snow. Many other peoples flights were cancelled as well and the prospect of finding a nearby ( and decent) place to stay for the night looked grim. 
I called a few hotels directly and did a few searches and found nothing. 
Then I decided to try out the Booking.com app I had recently downloaded. I found a room at a Best Western near the airport and booked it immediately through the app. 
When we arrived at the hotel about 20 minutes later there were 2 couples in front of us who had also tried to book rooms online using a different app. The front desk had no record of their bookings and the hotel was by then full. We were apprehensive approaching the desk. 
As it turned out Booking.com had faxed my information to the hotel as soon as they received it (through the reservation I made using the app.) and we got one of the last rooms available that night.
They receptionist at the hotels front desk said 'Booking.com is on top of their game' and I agreed. 
Also the hotel was nice, clean, and in a good location. And we got a great price! 
For being stuck in Newark at 11:30 at night things couldn't have gone more smoothly for us. 
Thanks! 

 (Need to be specific with prices) Good application, very helpfull. Need to be specific about prices per person (many hotels are marked with price and number of beds with breakfast, but it is not clear if price for room or per person). For example price is 900 for three bed room with breakfast, while the same price is for two bed room or four bed room. Very confusing.

My girlfriend nixes about every hotel I pick because the trip advisor information isn't flattering. So I wish booking would show the trip advisor score- it would really save me a lot of time and be easier on their inventory.

 (Love this app!!!) My friend told me about this app at the beginning of the year and I have been using it to book all my trips. I had an issue where the hotel charged me for canceling 3 days before the deadline. I was getting no where with the hotel so I called booking.com and they were all over it. Needless to say that the hotel manager called me and refunded my money. Great customer service, great hotel rates (most of which require no deposit) and a very user friendly app.

Version 4.7.1 5

 (Very good and like the map feature) Have been using the web version and I really like the iPad version. Easy to navigate and find hotels just by moving around the map which is a really cool feature. My only recommendation would be to be able to email the hotel I found directly from the app to a friend to show them the hotel. At the moment you need to go directly to the webpage to be able to share the link to the hotel. I recommend this app.

Your website is most helpful, it is easy to use and very intuitive.  During the course of the last 2 weeks I have used the site to book several international reservations and I have been very pleased with the information provided re. the hotels and the speed of the booking process and the quick and complete email confirmations.  During these two weeks I have also had occasion to cancel a reservation, to modify a reservation, to make a special request of a hotel.  All of these aspects of booking have been handled promptly and efficiently by booking.com.  I have also added the booking.com app to my iPhone and have found it to be a 5 star app.  I am very pleased with the service of booking.com.

 (The best web sit) موقع مميز من زمن بعيد واشكرهم علي جهودهم 
كما نرغب بالاضافة لعدد المناطق وعدد الفنادق والشقق الفندقية والشاليهات 
كما ارى ان يتم اضافة عدد الغرف لكل شقة والتوضيح اكثر وتحدث الصور 
لان الشخص يحجز بناء علي الصور الموجودة بالموقع وعند الذهاب يجد الفرش قد قدم واتسخ ومن زمن بعيد لم يغيير 
فهذه مصيبة 
اسف ع الاطالة 
شاكر لكم تفهمكم وتعاونكم وتقديم خدماتكم المميزة
الى الامام واتمني لكم التوفيق

Version 4.4 5
 (It's awesome) I like booking

Version 4.4 1
 (If I could give minus stars, I would.) I made my reservation on my iPad through booking.com because the site stated I could cancel my reservation 24 hours beforehand without being charged. The only reason I booked it was because of this.
Time comes and I decide to cancel 24 hours before and I'm informed I have to pay for one night. I called customer service to be informed I still have to pay. I explained to her I made my appointment through my iPad and was told iPads server was different from the one she is using. I said " how can you charge me for my room when you can't even see what I'm looking at?". They charged me anyway. 
I will never use this site again. I used it for Italy, New York and recently, Miami. 
I'm just so disappointed and feel taken advantage of.

Version 4.4 5
 (I have used this app in several countries. It is Awesome!) The best part is you can even book the day of arrival (before noon). I just use it on the go and don't worry about booking a week ahead of time. Excellent choices. Reviews are better than stars for picking a good place plus the map always let's you know if the hotel is convenient to the train or sightseeing.

 (Best hotel search engine ever ...) I have been using booking.com since 2008 and every time it search guaranteed best price and quality hotels. And now there is a handy app. Can't get better than this.. Cheers..

Version 4.4 4
 (Awesome Hotel App) The only thing that held me back from a 5 star rating is the fact that I'd like to see more consistency on room pictures.  It should be required that to list your property, a picture of each room be supplied.

I used this app to book in Montreux, Switzerland and I found it frustrating that not all room types had photos.  On example was a historic hotel with pics posted of the standard room and the option for a "superior" room for $100 more.  The room dimensions are identical for both standard and superior so photos could have made all the difference.

Version 4.4 4
 (Nice app and easy to use.) Use it for booking hotels and this just does the job.

Version 4.4 5
 (Great) Makes it the iPhone a work of art

Version 4.4 5

 (Prefer Mobile Site) This app takes too long to load cities, and does not show everything that the mobile site has to offer. I love booking.com and their mobile website however I believe that this app isn't up to their standards.

Version 4.4 1
 (Professional Ripoff) Used the app and the price doubled. Upon receiving my verification, the dates were wrong and since it was non-refundable, phone calls, e-mails, etc. The end of the day, my price got doubled for the same rooms, and I will be making my own reservations in the future since I don't need an app to lose money for me. Try to make one that makes money for me-then we'll talk.

Version 4.4 5

Version 4.4 5
 (Great App!) I LOVE this app! It is so perfect for on-the-go booking. We are backpacking across Europe and have booked every hostel/hotel with this app. It allows you to easily select the date of arrival, how many nights, and number of people in the party and see all available results for your criteria... Something that is surprisingly difficult on other websites. One of the BEST features of this app is that it keeps the details of all of your booked hotels so you can easily access any of the information, including a google map location of it! It even also you to add the details automatically to your iPhone calendar!! Awesome app and it's FREE!!

Version 4.4 4

 (ممتاز لكن) سعره نفس الحجز عن طريق الفندق مباشرة الا اذا كانت هناك عروض فلاش
واكثر الفنادق اذا شافوا حجزك عن طريق البوكينج انواع التطفيش والاستهبال والتاخير اتمنا معالجة هذه النقطة
من اسوأ الفنادق من ناحية هذه النقطة **فتدق دبليو الدوحة** سي جدا جدا من ناحية الخدمة
حيث كل شي تدفعه الان او بيخصم من الفيزا
باقي الفنادق الدفع عند التشك اوت
افضل فندق صرلحة ريتز كارلتون فينكال دبي واوريكسي روتانا الدوحة
ايضا الحجز عن طريق المكاتب السياحية ارخص وافضل

Version 4.3.1 4
 (Very good app) Easy to navigate, intuitive and decent rates make it a great app for leisure or business travel.

Version 4.2.1 3
 (Good app!) Selection is very comprehensive.  Prices seem comparable to other discount sites though the first price quoted which lures me to the particular property is not necessarily reflective of the most popular type of rooms that I choose such as a queen or king size room/bed.

Version 4.3.1 5
 (Perfect for my travel business) I own a travel business that takes small groups to Italy. I use booking.com almost exclusively to find and book the hotels and other places my groups stay in. It's perfect because I can cancel rooms close to last minute if I have to make changes to the group. It's also easy to compare places, make sure they are in the right neighborhood by using the map feature, and read reviews from other people. I have never been disappointed using this app for booking my business and personal locations.

Version 4.2.1 4
 (Good) I would give this a 5-star only if the booking dates can be fixed. It is difficult to choose a date because the numbers don't fit in the box for choosing dates.

What pleasant and useful integration!

 (A major disappointment) The 1st time I tried it, in the Dallas, TX area, it did not allow me to limit the search to under $100, plus it did not even bother to list hotels that offer rooms for under $100. As such, the search info returned is biased at best. I am deleting this useless app!

Version 4.2.1 5

 (Uh..NOoo) 'Best price guaranteed'... False.. Out of the many hotel finders; quite disappointing..offering very few options, & ridiculous pricing...   especially if you are a pet owner. After comparing several apps... This one is worthless.. Try Price Negotiator, Expedia, or Hotels.com for a great price! No joke

Version 4.2.1 5
 (Great app) I typically use Expedia or Tripadvisor but both of their apps are terrible.... Was using the booking.com website and was directed to this app and gave it a try... The filter feature is good and doesn't crowd the screen, instead the map showing the locations of only the hotels in your filter results is REALLY useful especially when you don't know much about the area that ou are traveling to...  Will ONLY use this app in the future

 (Awesome App!) I was recently traveling in Tokyo on business and needed a last-minute hotel reservation. I asked my Japanese business associate to suggest a hotel in the area. While he went to the bathroom I found the Booking.com app. Faster than he could use the fully automated Toto Wash-let, I downloaded it, chose my area, number of nights, persons per room, viewed pictures, read customer reviews, booked my hotel and had a confirmation email sent to me! Chottomatte! (wait a moment!), Unbelievably easy booking was one thing but that's not all! The description, pictures of the hotel, customer comments and ratings were all right on! This was the best hotel I stayed at in all my years in Tokyo! Much better than the hotel recommendations made by my Japanese business associates! I will definitely use this app on my next hotel booking. Booking.com is Ichiban!

 (Great UI) Think the apps UI is great but have you seen the prices. I checked with different websites namely Kayak and it blew the doors of this app prices. So in my opinion this app is just a novelty but you need to work on the prices for the hotel if you wanna stay in business in this economy. And so far app like this come and go but no one has come close to kayak's prices generally speaking. I had down loaded this app and within 30 min I deleted it, after checking prices for Miami,fl and Las Vegas, NV

يعاب على الموقع انه لايوجد تحديث لصور الفنادق وهي غير دقيقة 
ايضا لا يوجد خيار للبحث عن المنتجعات، فقط الفنادق، واضطر للدخول الى المنتجع في بوكنج عن طريق جوجل

تحياتي 

Of the most beautiful applications, told me a lot, and easy to use
Shame on the site that he does not have updated pictures of hotels is inaccurate
Also there is no option to search for resorts, hotels only, and was forced to enter the resort in Booking by Google

Took me about 10 min. to read reviews on the hotels look at the pics. and compare prices to find one i liked and then like 2 to book. And i got three nights in San diego for less than 200 dollars at a hotel that usually charges 100 a night. Pretty awesome.

Version 3.3 5
 (Fan-frickin-Tastic!) Found an affordable room in Paris at a great location. 
This app let us book and confirm, then put a digital copy of confirmation in photos. Map shows where hotel is and photos of hotel are useful too. There are even guest reviews. 
The only drawback is directions to hotel are only useful if driving. We'll have to find our own way via train and subway. 
Still, A must have app!

Wish you all the best and deserve more than 10 starts.

Version 3.3 4
 (جيد جداً) البرنامج جيد جداً فقط يحتاج الى تعديل الخريطة بشكل اكبر و جعله اكثر دقة في اسماء المناطق و المدن و اسماء القرى و اضافة شريط المسافة بمعنى خط يبين المسافة من منطقة لاخرى حتى يسهل على المستخدم حساب المسافة التي سيقطعها
فمثلاً ساحجز في فندق و الفندق كم يبعد عن الحرم المكي بالمتر او بالكيلو متر و هكذا...

Version 3.3 5
 (Great Results, Useful Features) Exhaustive listings with a lot of relevant, useful info for booking hotels -- reviews, photos, reservation details -- even in smaller towns.

 (Pretty Awesome) You can easily book. There are a lot of sort options with map views etc. Once you've booked you van press the button to send to a friend, auto add your booked dates to your iPad calendar, plan route or auto add image of booking to your camera.

 (Poor features, does what advertized) Although this app does what advertized, there are a couple of features that fall short of what one could expect: No way to see booking history (forward and backward), user login (and password) must be entered at each access, etc... I use it anyway, but...

Booking was a snap. The only thing that's needed is for the cancelation details to be a little more clear. Some of them are a bit confusing. Aside from that... Great work!

Version 3.3 1
 (No Reservation at Actual Hotel) I called the best western hotel to confirm my reservation and they said booking.com never sent it. Not only that, but they had already been sold out for 4 hours before I tried to book it, so the app never should have accepted it in the first place. Effectively, a useless, misleading app.

Version 3.3 5
 (Jim) First time I have ever book a room and it was very easy. I'm 74 and I can't get over this iPhone and what it will do.!!!

Version 3.3 5
 (Deliriously Easy to Use!) Title says it all. They thought of everything!  Save reservation to iPhoto album in my iPhone...really, now. That's got to be a first, and terrific when I don't have a printer to print to. Who wants the extra paper, anyway?

La decoracion del Lobby es horrible.
Los cuartos estan mal decorados, huelen a humedad y estan sucios los baños.
Cuando llueve fuerte , el agua se mete  a los cuartos inundandolos peligrosamente. El agua pasa por los conductos de las luces. Existe un problema estructural y de construccion de ductos.
El personal trata de resolver los problemas pero  falta personal en todos lados del Hotel.
No vendan el Hotel como una maravilla pues es ruidoso y pico seguro

Version 3.2 5
 (الرياض) مميز

Version 3.2 4
 (really good for the frequent traveler) I've found this app to be really good at finding the cheapest hotel bookings and the ipad app functions really smoothly and so quickly. when the app tells you it takes two minutes to book, it isn't kidding!

Version 3.2 1
 (Too cumbersome) Have to get on line to set up, not super easy

Version 3.2 4
 (Very Well Designed) The people who designed this app did a really good job on the small things. For example, in the credit card field the keyboard defaults to numeric, rather than making you switch from alpha, and it displays the cc number in chunks of four, rather than jamming all sixteen digits together, making it easier to read. These things sound trivial, but they really speed up the process and eliminate the aggravation usually associated with entering data on a phone or tablet. I wish all developers would take the time to execute this well.

Version 3.2 4
 (Perfect for Honeymoon / Internat'l Travel!) I love the map view & picture viewer!  I would like a few features added- ability to save Favorites & open their webpage in Safari / email webpage link vs. a link to the app.

Version 3.2 2
 (Search ? .?.) We have already established our vacation and travel stays prior to running this app. ... Thank God.  This program has no U.S. Data base for hotels.  Waste of time

The only one drawback that I have found is that it doesn't index ALL available hotels. But anyway it has more hotels than the other apps and gives you much better user experience than other applications of this class.

 (Does exactly what it says) As we have taken our vacation trip, Booking has been our go to app for hotels.  Where will we stop today?  Check the app and book a room.  Too easy.

Version 3.1 5
 (Rating) Very useful & great app

Version 3.1 5
 (The only useful booking app I could find) Has almost the entire functionality of the booking.com website, but more functional. I especially like the way one can explore the hotels directly on the map, then bring them out as a numbered list. I would take off half a star maybe if I could for inability to translate reviews directly from the review, as the tripadvisor website does. Linking the reviews to google translator would be very useful.

Version 3.1 1
 (Not great.) Could have gotten same room $5 cheaper by booking myself. (I was in a hurry.) won't be using the APP again.

 (nice) i like this app
A+++

Version 3.1 1
 (Where do they get their prices??) The prices they show as crossed out it seems like they made those numbers up to show more of a savings?.? They're way off. Check Caesars Palace in Vegas, go to their web site and compare prices and you'll understand what I mean. On this app it shows  $1,900 crossed out and booking.com price is around $715... That's basically the normal price you can get anywhere, it's actually cheaper through Caesars.  You can find better deals elsewhere. Really no savings here. 

Version 3.1 4
 (Easy and useful) Just right for making a quick booking. Prices are very competitive.

Version 3.1 3
 (Needs Sync!!) The app only keeps track of what you book from the app. If you book it online, it does not sync with the app. It should, but it doesn't. So the app is just a search tool, which google or bing is better at.

It's fast, covers most hotels, and the customer reviews are essential to know what hotels to stay at. I have used this app, and the website,  for many a trip, and have never been let down. It helps you find the hidden gems you may otherwise have never known about!

Version 3.0 4
 (Great app!!!) Very useful and easy to use.

Version 3.0 2
 (Nothing to see here but even that gets pricey.) The first time in which I opened this App I found a lot of amusement reading about a place in Chicago in which the word 'dirty' inevitably appeared alongside 'rude' in almost every review of a Michigan Ave hotel.  I thought,  "great ap,  I learned a lot here."
The subsequent searches in another area (Champaign-Urbana) brought up 1 hotel in an area with at least 25 hotels...  What the heck!  No matter what parimeters I used,  a Hilton for $285 a night was the only thing this App could find in a much cheaper than usual town.
Perhaps there is a fleece my butt mode that I have accidentally activated,  but that seems to be the only option which I have with this App anymore.

Version 3.0 5
 (Love it!) Easy to use, great info. Very pleasantly surprised!!!

Version 3.0 5

Version 3.0 5
 (excellent app for hotel booking) very useful, with a large selection of hotels worldwide, easy to use and helpful. A minor drawback is that it seems like one cannot sign in with a booking.com account inside this app, what is a little odd... but that's ok, you can do everything nevertheless.

 (Mrs. Salazar) This app is awesome! The website itself is great but the way they have set this app up makes it even easier then the website. The only thing that I would add is the ability to save favorite hotels. Otherwise a perfectly constructed app!

 (nice app but...) Very nice app for booking hotels on my iPad. However,  It can't  filter the result by location(district of the city ),which exists in the iPhone version. I don't understand why they remove this from the iPad version.

Version 2.6.1 5
 ())) its cool

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Great app) I've used the website to book hotels several times and found the website to be the best out there. Just downloaded the app and used to book my hotel in Paris. Worked great. I really like the option to add a photo of your reservation in your camera roll.

Version 2.6.1 3
 (Good, but no Favorites) Good app, but why can't you save favorite hotels in diff cities? Please add this feature. Most ppl rsrch multiple hotels first & narrow down later after all options explored. Also, want bookmarks to recommend good hotels found in various cities for future trips. Pls update & will change rating. Thanks.

Version 2.6.1 5
 (The bomb) Very useful and saves time.

Version 2.6.1 4
 (Works on a plane!) I managed to use the app on the terribly slow gogo airplane wifi. So if it works here at 30,000 ft it will do a great job on the ground.
I'd like to see a couple of extra search criteria but I feel the same way about the regular on-line version as well. 
I use booking.com all the time and think it is a great booking site

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Saved the Trip) Perfect Ap for Travelling - private or Business

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Good idea) Good idea

Version 2.6.1 5
 (The best hotel reservation tool ever) This is really the best hotel reservation tool ever known. and because I am a poor planner, it happened twice that I decided to spend a night or two in another city, and all what I took is my car, small bag and an iPad. I made reservations from a coffee shop when I reached my destination. Then I just went to the hotel. ( some times you need to show them the reservation email since you will be reaching the hotel before the conformation)

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Recenzja) Bardzo przydatna aplikacja przed planowaniem podrozy.

Version 2.6.1 3
 (Nice) It need more photos but it is nice

Version 2.6.1 3
 (Star'z635) Is ok but needs a little more

Version 2.6.1 3
 (Cool app) Just got this app so far it's cool. It gives you pics of the hotel and pics of the rooms. To kinda give you an ideal of what your getting yourself into. But I'm not sure just yet so I'm gonna give it a 3 star rating.

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Makes travel easier) Very impressed with this app. Selection of lodging is limited but enough variety for our budget. Much easier than other hotel booking apps I've used. I really like that it defaults to today's date, 1 nite, and 2 people. Perfect for finding rooms while we are on the road, taking our route and timing changes in stride.

Version 2.6.1 4
 (Useful app) Ease ur booking

Version 2.6.1 3
 (Feedback) Please can you do in the facilities section a more detailed discription, like icons on your website for example, cuz I can't see if hotels have a free wi fi or breakfast or parking, cuz it's just list of all facilities and not so detailed as on a website.

Version 2.6.1 2
 (Can't Adjust Pricing From High to Low) Downloaded this app and thought it would be an excellent app for traveling. For the most part, it's not too bad, but I could never get it to adjust down with regards to pricing. It would adjust up to high prices, but never down. Did a search of a town that I know has 20+ hotels and all it would give me is (1). Bottom line is, glad I didn'tpay for it, so now it's it's deleted.

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Muito bom!!!) App indispensavel para programar suas ferias!

Version 2.6.1 5

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Perfect!) A++

Version 2.6.1 4
 (Awesome) Great app! Use it all the time when I travel. I

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Absolutely amazing app!) This is the only app to use for securing a place to stay.  Its easy, fast, and by far the best rates anywhere around. I had to call custumor serv. With a hotel issue and the agent was so friendly and understanding... I'll never even bother to download another application for securing travel accommodations.

Version 2.6.1 5
 (great hotel app) Easy to navigate; lots of info

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Awesome) Like it

Version 2.6.1 4
 (So far so good) Just made my first booking ... It went like a breeze ...  I didn't rate it 5 .. Because booking through booking.com still more informative

Version 2.6.1 5
 (Very simple) I thought it went very well, however I wish more details were given on the room

Version 2.6 5
 (10 points) Great app, very useful!

Version 2.6 5
 (Good app but not the best rates) App is great to compare prices.  Works great but you can get better rates on other sites.

Version 2.6 4
 (Good app not as many hotels) Good app, some issues with slowness of the app, but good for the most part. Did not find many of the standard chain hotels in the search, but that's probably just a matter of time. Like the map search, would like multi search such as 4 and 5 stars.

Version 2.6 5
 (Best app) It is best app I use in my bad but I want  use it by Arabic language like booking.com

Version 2.6 5
 (Excellent app, a pleasure to use) Everything works just as it should and fits the ipad perfectly.

 (V.G) Well done...

Version 2.6 5
 (Easy to use) Excellent app.

Version 2.5 4
 (Helped our trip) We booked some great hotels. Reviews were very important.
A major issue though, is to make sure that the default of same day reservation does not kick in and you accidentally book same day nonrefundable. Double check your dates. Triple check your dates. The iPad app worked well.
The maps load slow though. There should be a way to save a map to email for people running on wifi. We are in Belgium.
Maps would be a big help.

Version 2.5 5
 (Jan) Great app

Version 2.5 5
 (Excellent and easy to use) Fantastic app and helped me book hotels on the road with am excellent price.

Version 2.5 3
 (Booking) I think the app is really good. I just went to a hotel recommend by booking and it was accurate.

Version 2.5 5
 (This is the one) Easy to use. Quotes great prices. Pictures. Very professional in appearance and use.

Version 2.5 3
 (Children) It's a great app, but I had problems when reserving a room with a baby. It said it was free, but the hotel would't allow me to take her. Should have a filter for children.

Version 2.5 4
 (App is good) But the list of countries wich you use to tell where are you from is too short, in my case there is no Belarus.

Version 2.5 5
 (Cool) This game is so cool.

Version 2.5 1
 (Not a full listings of hotels) There are more than 42 hotels in Dallas and none of them are hostels.

Version 2.5 5
 (Great app!) Very easy, fast and all the pertinent info is available.

Version 2.5 5
 (Great) Really nice app. I started searching for vacation spots and im really happy with the results!

Version 2.5 4
 (Mr.) Nice app - great utility for frequent travelers & booking.com users

Version 2.5 5
 (Greattt) Thanks

Version 2.5 5
 (Great App) I experienced no problems with this app and found it to be quite useful and very user friendly.

Version 2.5 1
 (Doesn't work!) Cmon,do you know how many hotels n motels are in and near Harrisburg Pa? I got one response from this app and it was10 miles away!  Don't bother with this!

Version 2.5 5
 (Helped me book my hotel!) This booking app helped me search through the hotels in Hong Kong with ease, much better flow than using a browser. And I managed to book a room! Thanks so much. This is exactly what I needed!

Version 2.5 1
 (Doesn't work) Found no hotels in my area. It's a joke.

Version 2.5 1
 (Uck) Not very useful if you just need a room like stat.

Version 2.5 5
 (Awsome!) Best of the best booking sites ever in one touch !

Version 2.5 3
 (Good app) Good for booking hotels but selection isn't that great

Version 2.5 4
 (Good app) Ok

Version 2.5 1
 (Bad) Said no hotels on Pensacola beach, Pensacola FL or Tallahassee,FL

Guess this app really doesn't work.

Version 2.5 5
 (Nice app) I like it!

Version 2.5 1
 (Horrible) I live in Orlando FL. tried it on my area to see how it works. It located 2. In the hotel capital of the U.S only 2. Don't waste ur time. Try KAYAK it found 600 in a 30m radius.

Version 2.5 1
 (Garbage -- try Hotelpal) The only people rating this app highly are likely those who have not seem any others.  This is pure trash, apparently supported by the hotels rated in the app. 

Lists only a handful of hotels in any area.  Example:  it shows 3 hotels for Cleveland (all $100+), where Hotelpal shows 50 or more. 

Sponsored garbage, masked as an independent travel aid.  They should be ashamed.

Version 2.5 3
 (Phone numbers?) This app would be more useful and friendly if it also provided the phone number of the hotels. It provides the address and map, why not the phone number?

Version 2.5 4
 (Cool) It's nice app. I use this for my trip

Version 2.5 5
 (Best deal) The best app for travel

Version 2.5 1
 (No hotels in your area) Useless!

Version 2.5 5
 (very nice) the best app

Version 2.5 5
 (Love the app!) I downloaded the app to compare with kayak and this just blew it away! Had to book a hotel for 1 night right as I was getting on the plane. by the time I landed I had received the confirmation while I was in the air. Only thing that needs improvement is the rating system. Ramada suites not a 3 star but  1 star.

Version 2.5 5
 (excellent!) very useful!!

Version 2.4.1 5
 (Life Saver!) Had to book a room last minute and wasn't sure if this would work but it got us a great room in a nice area in Houston for just $55! Super easy to use :]

 (Ok) Is not very thorough or extensive

Version 2.4.1 1
 (We have an University here!!!) & tons of hotels... Yet there are "no hotels found in Cape Girardeau, MO. area"...will delete app after I press send.

Version 2.4.1 1
 (Worthless) Crappy app, told me there was one hotel in the city I'm in. There must be at least 100 here. Don't waste your time

Version 2.4 5
 (E) Great

Version 2.4 5
 (Great app!) Very helpful and easy to use!!!!

Version 2.4 2
 (No filter for the hotels) You can not choose the number of rooms 

No filter to choose with swimming pool or breakfast

Version 2.3 5
 (O melhor!) Sem dúvidas é o melhor do ramo.

Completo, muito bem planejado o que torna a navegação muito simples e eficiente, alem da inteligente funcão de fazer buscas a partir do mapa (e a função localização é bem precisa). 

Super recomendado!!

Version 2.3 1
 (Not as good as Hotelpal) This is no where near as slick as Hotelpal. I've used a few of these apps. Hotel pal has more hotels. The rates seem the same.

Version 2.3 1
 (No hotels) No hotels?!?

Version 2.3 3
 (Easy) Easy to use!

Version 2.3 5
 (Nice and easy) The app is amazingly nice and easy to use. I really recommend it to everyone uses the web to book for hotels. I like the fact that it allows you to save an image of you booking details in your photo library. Go ahead and download you want regret it.

Version 2.3 5
 (Very easy to use!) I really like the app. Just used it to book three different hotels for an upcoming biz trip, and it was delightfully simple and intuitive. My only request for future versions is that I would like to see the average customer rating along with the hotel's star rating. This would have made my searching go a bit quicker. I applaud the other features, eg saving an image of the booking details, etc. I have used Booking almost exclusively for 5 years now, and I am a very satisfied customer.

Version 2.3 4
 (A very handy app. It allows a multitude of choices and even saves the reservation info into the cal) It saves the room info into your photo library.

Version 2.2 2
 (Низкое качество приложения) Перевод с ошибками, действия в диалогах не соответствуют выбранным значениям, частые вылеты программы

Version 2.2 4
 (Goood) Thins booking.com (:

Version 2.2 5
 (Espectacular!!) Just to virtualing visitors of hotels

Version 2.2 5
 (Easy , fast , great map) The best thing ever is to check the hotel location so you could book the one near to the attraction you need , for example I book the nearest hotel to the metro station ;)

Version 2.2 5
 (Best app) Best booking app

Version 2.2 1
 (2. ) 

Version 2.2 1
 (Didn't make booking!) I thought this app was very handy---until I showed up at the hotel, and they had NO RECORD of my booking! And the hotel was totally booked! Slick interface and easy to use, but worse than useless if the booking doesn't go through. I had my confirmation email from Booking.com, but no reservation.

Version 2.2 1
 (Most expensive rates/ Not recommended) I have used other applications to book my rooms and by far this is the most expensive of them all.

Version 2.1 5
 (The BEST booking App) I have always used booking.com's website to make my travel arrangements. The app is fast and in many ways better than the website even! I have tried Kayak and other apps as well. This is the best so far.

Version 2.1 5
 (Excellent, easy to use and fast) Just downloaded  it and completed my first booking!

Version 2.1 4
 (Usefull & Very simple) Great app, with all basic resources you look for. The booking process is very straight forward and fast.

Version 2.1 1
 (Keyboard bug) There is no way to change the keyboard language. On my ipad the keyboard appears in Greek and not let me change it.

Version 2.0 1
 (No State option search) It only gaves the name of the city, followed by "Unites Sates of America" and does not tells you in which STATE it is!! How many "plymouth" are there in USA!?!?!

Version 1.1 5
 (Very useful and very clean interface) Very nice app with great information and clean design.

Version 1.1 5
 (Great) Make one for hoteliers!!!

Version 1.1 1

 (Excellent experience) Excellent way to find the best hotel pricing.  I'm a fan.

Version 1.0 5
 (Fast, slick, great hotels) Just discovered this new app today while looking for a nearby hotel. I was impressed by the way the hotel listings integrate seamlessly with the map view. Easy and fast to find the right hotel.
