Version 29.0.0 5

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Outstanding!) I love the options

Version 29.0.0 4
 (Pretty Good) This version is refreshing to use. Finding a flight is a very fluid and eye popping experience. The only con I can see is the lack of choice for selecting the second leg of flights with multiple stops. All in all, this great for mobile.

Version 29.0.0 5

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Best travel app) So easy to choose options and run a quick query.  Can take a bit long and filtering is a bit difficult but overall a great mobile app.

 (üëç) I use it very oftenüëç
Love it!

Version 26.0.4 1
 (Substandard app) Very annoying because it resets screens and filters, and doesn't allow you to copy information. I was trying to search flights. When I multi-task to type the information I need into a text app (because it won't copy/paste), almost everything's gone when I go back to Kayak.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Awesome) Easy and very efficient

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Good app) Easily search flights and hotels. Easier to sift through options online but app still works great!

Version 29.0.0 5

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Best app) Best travel app I have found...by far

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Very useful.) I have not booked a flight yet but I will soon. So my rating is for ease of use. Some people who wrote reviews may not be aware what a monumental job it is to design search engines for such a huge databases as flight, hotel and other travel related information it is. Being a professional in the field of databases, I can tell you this is as good as it gets. So enjoy!

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Can't Beat it!!!!!) Kayak is THE best to find a hotel for you and anywhere and you can compare from other websites or apps and kayak will have the lowest price for the same room you're looking at

Version 29.0.0 4

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Stars) 5

Version 29.0.0 2
 (Nice design but lacks features...) ....
-no 3 day before/3 day after search function like Orbitz.
-no way to tell if flights are non stop.
-no advanced search feature.
-no calendar view like ITA Matrix.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Superior App) Best travel app out there to date.

Version 29.0.0 4
 (Great travel app) Easy to use and comprehensive

Version 29.0.0 4
 (Works pretty fine) Pretty easy to use and navigate. Just wish that kayak posted the dates of departures/arrivals on itineraries that have multiple overnight flights or cross multiple time zones.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Great!) So easy to use!

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Awesome) Perfect app for the job.

 (Easy site) Quick way to check flight etc on the fly

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Great app!!!) Very reliable

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Great and streamlined.) Works perfectly on an iPhone 5s with iOS 7.0.4. Shows all flight times, layovers, and it's easy to find the cheapest price for your airfare. Before checkout it shows pricing on other travel sites. I fully recommend this.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Excellent app) This app keeps getting better for my purposes. It makes my travel more convenient and efficient.

Version 29.0.0 2
 (Terrible one way vs round trip organization) When you choose the round trip option it makes it confusing and discombobulating to book a trip, it only gives you the one way option instead of the complete round trip view like on the website... I use kayak constantly on my computer but find it impossibly aggravating to use on my iPhone.

Version 29.0.0 4
 (Kayak) It's really awesome

Version 29.0.0 4
 (Great app) I enjoy this app. A good way to get an idea what to except when planing a trip.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Awesome!) I loved the clever names for distance under the filters for hotels. "A stone's throw"=.1 mile "hop, skip & jump"=.2 mile  "easy walk"=1 mile "short drive"=6 miles "pretty far"=10 miles and "infinity"=any distance

A witty app is a good app.

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Somebody is making money) And it isn't the user of this app. Deleted.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Very good app) I think this is a very efficient app, just because it shows you all the prices and you are guaranteed that you will not find them at lower prices.

Version 29.0.0 3
 (Wrong prices) Easy to use. Frequently the lowest price posted is erroneous. When you click through to actually book a car or hotel the price can be significantly higher.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Awesome-ness) I'm in the military and don't have time to sit and spend hours looking this is great it gives me everything I need

Version 29.0.0 5
 (I like the app!) Help checking the flights!

Version 28.0.0 5

 (Handy) Super handy for price comparison.  I use it a lot!

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Easy to use) I love this app!  It's so easy to use!

Version 29.0.0 4
 (My go to travel app) This is the app I go to first for checking out hotels airfares cars etc. One thing I would love to see in the application is the ability to save hotels that I may be interested in without actually booking. Please add that function.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Great app) I love Using this app to find cheap tickets.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Great app!) This app is great for tracking your travel plans and saving your trip information. I love the trip agenda view.

Version 29.0.0 1
 (Returns wrong results) It keeps on returning search results for airports that I did not use one the search...

Version 29.0.0 5
 (nice and quick) loads data quickly, easy to book, prices as good as you can find

Version 26.0.4 1
 (Their Website Shows Better Fares) I started looking for flights using the Kayak for iPad app which then directs me to book a fare on kayak.com or Orbitz. I couldn't purchase the fare Kayak found me on Orbitz.com inside the Kayak iPad app, I was sent in an endless loop after entering my credit card info 5 times. I finally went to Kayak.com, to my amazement, I found even lower fares using the exact same search criteria. These were "Hacker" fares that Kayak.com shows but Kayak for iPad does not show! Both your web site and your iPad app sent me to someone else's web site to actually book and purchase tickets, what gives? Gone are the days of calling a travel agent to book your flights, we've all been booking our own flights online or in a mobile app for years now, why is Kayak and Kayak.com SO COMPLICATED and the fares inconsistent? Fix it please, so I don't have to delete your iPad app, your Kayak.com web site is soooooooooooooooo slow! I'd rather use the Kayak app, but only if you show ALL fares, I feel cheated!

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Good app for on-the-go planning) Works conveniently for researching flights or trips on-the-go.

It is a bit annoying when narrowing in on searches. For example when I narrowed flights by price, travel time, etc., the ball on the meter does not stay put. It fluctuates and thus my search is not as narrowed in! I recommend that kayak updates this with a + and - on either end so the target range is selected properly.

Version 29.0.0 4
 (Always a go to) Always a go to, works very well.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Easier than my laptop) This app made for the easiest hotel booking I have ever done.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Good design) Best in class with clear layout.

Version 29.0.0 1
 (Frozen on installation) Unusable

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Pretty legit app) I can USUALLY find a better deal here than with the actual hotels/airlines. If it's cheaper to go through the direct source, Kayak says so. This is great.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Excellent) Very easy to use

Version 29.0.0 4
 (Serving all my needs) Hasn't let me down. Quick and easy to find flights and compare prices. Wish they had a feature with different prices on different dates of the calendar

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Great) Great site

Version 28.0.0 4
 (Works well) Useful quick app. What you'd expect

Version 29.0.0 2
 (Swap cities when booking) Where has the "swap cities" (the function with which you change one city with the other when looking for flights) button gone?

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Great prices) I like the variety of flights and hotels available each time I look something up.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Great. Five Star app) Hands down the best app of its kind.

Version 29.0.0 1
 (Terrible - doesn't work) I click roundtrip but it will only let me book one way.

Version 29.0.0 4
 (Kayak!) Love it! Most of the time, supplies me with the cheapest fares.

Version 25.0.1 2
 (Does not matrix of days) Very hard to use. Does not check Southwest and does not check multiple days!

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Love Kayak!) I couldn't live without this app

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Great) Great incorporation of the new style in the iOS, amazing prices from an array of airlines, and very easy to use. Fast too!

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Love it) This version is so much better than the previous ones - it might be the best KAYAK version yet.

Version 29.0.0 5
 (Works Great!) app works great, just what I need for trip planning and pricing

Version 29.0.0 2
 (Nice comprehensive app but.....) The pictures in My Trips are nice but now the completed trips are kind lumped together with the current ones.  I like having access to the completed trips but it would be better if they had their own folder or section. The ads are annoying too

Version 28.0.0 1
 (Need more features) Needs more of the features that are available on the full site.

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Love Kayak app!!) Delivers fast and easy results so you can make an informed decision!

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Good site to start) Looking at last minute holiday plans is easy when booking with kayak

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Great) Great

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Great) Nice app very convenient and you can find tickets at very good price

Version 28.0.0 2
 (Update disappoints) Can't see part of results...total hotel costs, for example, are off screen. Previous version didn't have this issue. This used to be a great app!

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Super like this App) I have been using this app for a year now. I have booked several vacations over the year. It's quick and easy. Best part is you have it all in one place. Finding deals is easy.

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Bomb!!) Love using kayak. It's easy and quick!

Version 26.0.0 5
 (Easiest travel booking app so far) Nothing more to say. Kayak has it nailed down.

Version 28.0.0 2
 (Kayak service is good, but app has issues) Kayak as a whole is great, but their app has some bugs that make the experience frustrating. Aside from vague details when looking at hotel rooms the form and booking page cuts off the right-side of the screen, hiding important information. After trying repeatedly to book a room I decided on using another service and app instead.

Version 28.0.0 5
 (I love the packing feature) App is great. It is missing option to select "cheapest day" on multi city flight selection.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Hashim) Very useful app , provide u with the lowest price for your travel and your stay .

Version 28.0.0 5

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Awesome app!!) Love this app, so easy to use.

Version 28.0.0 2
 (Missing Gate Information) I love this app for business travel but with the new upgrade they've hidden the gate information. Kind of important when your running to make a connection. I'm switching to another app. Too bad.

Version 28.0.0 5
 (KAYAK) Thanks kayak

Version 26.0.4 5
 (THE BEST) best travel site app by FAR

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Fast, clean and easy) I love how quickly and easily you can modify searches, add +/- 1 or 2 days, etc.

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Awesome app.) Couldn't live without it.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (RAN) Quick, comprehensive - easy for flights and robust hotel info

Version 24.0.1 2
 (Not Great but Getting Better) It still doesn't update gate changes fast enough.  iPhone 4(S) and earlier users won't be able to see assigned gates in Flight Tracker when a flight plan has connecting flights or warnings.  Gate assignments are not shown in the details view of Flight Tracker!???

Version 27.0.1 4
 (Upgrade) Do not upgrade, you will have to pay for the map of flight tracker

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Best travel app) One and done, fast and easy. Who doesn't love kayak?!

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Useful) Very useful to find flights or hotels when traveling.

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Excellent app) Superb for finding flights, filtering results and all sorts of stuff. The only thing missing is the ability to do + or -3 days.

Version 28.0.0 5

 (Great!) Has all the features needed for a great travel app

Version 28.0.0 4
 (Great app) I like the app. Just wish It had a way to compare the ones u like instead of having to keep going back and forth

Version 28.0.0 1
 (New update is a mess, iOS 7 strikes again) The new ios7 mess strikes again!  Kayak was a wonderful, intuitive and easy app to use.  The latest update takes all that away.  Like most of the iOS 7 stuff, the new app looks like an architectural draft rather than a completed app.  It doesn't even work correctly with the button for the class of fare off screen except for a faint trace at the bottom of the screen.  Use this app if you are in a bind.  Otherwise, better to use the desktop interface on a computer.  iOS 7 ruins another, formerly great app!

Version 28.0.0 5
 (A must have) Same great experience from the web on your smartphone.

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Much better than the website) I find this app indispensable for quickly checking prices on flights to plan trips. Large selection of hotels in most cities I've used it for. Definitely one of my most used apps!

 (Too unstable) Great app but too unstable. It crashes a lot!!!

Version 27.0.1 5
 (Great!!) Convenient!

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Kayak is the bomb.) Use it

Version 28.0.0 5
 (Beard or no beard, you'll love it!) This app is so useful and helps you get the lowest price FAST. So good it makes the small angels in my beard sing in joyous exultation.

Version 26.0.2 5
 (Easy to use, nice layout.) Good app!

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Love it) Love it

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Dates changed) I booked a hotel tonight for my Grandmother's funeral. I reviewed the dates on app and they represented what I needed. I booked, received the confirmation, and it is wrong. Needed room for 3 days from today, not tomorrow. Kayak passed the dates to priceline. I tried to change to the days that were needed with Priceline and the hotel, 250 dollar cancelation fee. All I wanted was to get rooms on the right date. Use hotels.com, or better yet, call the hotel directly. The agents on Priceline and at the Doubletree in Norwalk, CT were awful, and unfortunately, I believe this app contributed.

Version 27.0.1 5
 (So easy and so helpful!) Don't know how anyone travels anywhere without this app! I love that I can put my friends and family members flights in the flight tracker too and at the tap of a finger see if I need to leave early or late to pick them up. You can forward trip or flight confirmation emails to the app and it automatically uploads them into a My Trips section where your confirmation number and details are right there at your finger tips. It even has simple packing lists that you can keep or edit if you travel often. You can look up flight costs, vehicle rental costs, etc. at any time day or night. 
This app makes traveling fun again!

Version 27.0.1 4
 (Handy) Handy app

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Love it) I love this app. You can enter specific travel plans and it will alert you of the lowest prices. I've been able to monitor 2 upcoming vacations.

Version 26.0.4 4
 (We enjoy the app and service!) Nice work - we use it all the time!

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Search history is gone) Ver 27 the flight history is gone.  Put it back!!

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Useless APP) It gives you an amazing price then as soon as you click "book now" the price jumps up $60 or doubles. Not worth using at all

Version 27.0.1 1
 (App) Give me gold in tapjoy!

Version 27.0.1 1
 (0 stars) Oh my, if you decide to use Kayak then pray you don't have to calm customer service.  The upside of their customer service is that their English is so bad they don't understand the words one says to express their frustration and the downside is that their English is so bad they can't understand anything you say.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Kayak Review) From what I've read I feel blessed to have had no problems with this app. I have been using it a lot the past month and haven't experienced the issues other users have. This app is very intuitive, easy to use and I'd recommend it to anyone.

Version 27.0.1 3
 (Latest revisions helped, but still not what it was) I have no idea why iOS 7 had such a catastrophic  effect on the previously sensational Kayak app, but the initial changeover nearly wrecked all of its functionality.  Fortunately some recent revisions have made it more stable and easier to read, and restored many of the filters though not all of them (for round trips, I still miss the ability to filter out return flights that land at a different airport than the starting point).  So it's coming back towards its previous usefulness, though it isn't there yet.  One wonders: Did all the old developers leave?

Version 23.0.2 5
 (kayak) +1

Version 26.0.2 5
 (Best travel app) Instead of searching numerous sites to find the best deals, Kayak does it for you. Definitely a must have.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Kayak) Gutttt

Version 26.0.4 4
 (Very useful) I have been using kayak for years. I travel s lot and the 80% of my booking are made through this app or web site.

Version 26.0.4 4
 (Never had any problems with crashing.) Gets the job done.

Version 27.0.1 5
 (A+) No issues for me. Used it twice and never crash. 98% of the time I get the lowest price.

Version 24.0.0 5
 (Software developer) Great App.

Version 27.0.1 5
 (Gets me out of trouble) Maybe is my old OS on iphone4s but this app is very useful, it's very easy to get information from it quickly. Great temporary replacement when not I front of a PC or Mac.

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Don't bother getting app) This used to be a good app but now it's limited too specific airlines, doesn't search n compare most of the airlines.

Version 26.0.4 4
 (Quick search results) Quick search results with good 2 go options

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Love the App) It works great, very good navigation

Version 26.0.4 1
 (Travel Videos Troubling) I find it dismaying that your travel correspondent is not traveling to, or offering video information about, any travel destinations where people of color live. What a terribly missed opportunity to neglect the rich cultures, cuisines and natural beauty of the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean, South America, etc. Very interesting. The Eurocentricity has been noted. This application will be deleted.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Great app) Love to travel and Kayak makes it very easy to search hotels

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Nice) Easy and fast search, better and faster than desktop version of website.

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Worthless - Crashes on open) Whatever happened to support. App can't stay open for more than a couple of seconds. Has been this way for way too long. Don't even think about downloading. Total waste of time.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Clear, easy and fast!) Yes, I am not sure why I see one negative review.
I have a fabulous experience using the app.
Its sensible and fast.
Use it, save time...

Version 26.0.2 4
 (Kayak) So far it has been good.

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Awful.) :-(

Version 26.0.2 5
 (love it) this is my favorite app to lookup flights.
I buy on airline web sites but always search kayak first.

Version 27.0.1 1
 (iOS7 only...Are you KIDDING ME!!!) This version is only good with iOS7.  Of course, I didn't notice that until AFTER it was already updated in my iTunes App section.  I am not operating on iOS7...so this App is now useless to me...THANKS A LOT!  If you would kindly offer the previous version which works with iOS6 for those of us not yet on iOS7, I would kindly reciprocate with a better review.  Until then, ADIOS KAYAK!!!

Version 26.0.4 5
 (What great ux) Best mobile app for booking flights

Version 27.0.1 2
 (Saved Searches?!?!?!) Need them back then you have a fantastic app!

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Excellent app for travel!!) Very good prices and easy to book.
grate place to get a ticket and disappear. Good prices and lots of options.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Good all around) üëçüá∫üá∏

Version 26.0.2 1
 (iOS7 only?) Forcing iOS7 only weeks after it's release? HAHAHA!

I'm not installing a buggy OS that I can barely read just to continue to run this app.  I guess you don't need my company's purchases.

*DELETED* (after using since ver. 5)

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Love Kayak) The best flight locator world wide!

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Great app) Very convenient app. I use this app on a weekly basis to compare flights for my monthly trip to Atlanta.

Version 26.0.2 5
 (Excellent!) Yes!! Extremely fast and helpful.

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Price notifications) I mainly needed it for the price change notifications for flights. These were always inaccurate and did not help at all.

Version 26.0.2 5
 (Great App) I've become reliant on Kayak for iPhone for all my travel needs. It works well; it's  easy to use; and a great range of flights, hotels and car rentals.

Version 27.0.1 5
 (Works great) I've not bought any tickets yet but search works grate. Buying tickets tonight.

Version 27.0.1 4
 (Love it) This is the first place I look before booking any air or car.

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Doesn't work with iOS 7) Just got a 5s and this updated app doesn't work. Can select destination, but always gives blank results when you click search. Please fix!

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Easy to find flights) Use it all the time

Version 27.0.0 3
 (Saved Feature) Saved Feature is gone??!!

Version 26.0.4 5
 (*****) The best

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Mom) Wonderful all in one travel site! Thanks! Sheridon

Version 27.0.1 3
 (Where did saved searches go???) The saved search feature was the best now it's gone. Please put back and it's a 5 star app...

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Crashing etc) Don't release an update unless you test it!  It keeps remembering the last flight I tried to find and will not look for the new flight and there is no way to clear it. Also crashes when u click on the filter button.
Revised after new fix from sept 26th: now the filters aren't crashing it but it is still remembering the last search when I searched a multi-leg flight so I can t search for anything new. Still massively messed up.

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Can't change cities) When changing city pairs for flight search, search results don't reflect this change. Ex: Firsr searched Chicago to Cancun and looked at results. Went back to search page and updated cities to search for flights from Chicago to Miami. But Search results on the next page still show results for Chicago to Cancun. This app is unusable in its current state!

Version 27.0.1 4
 (Cannot view how far hotels are from city anymore) Before the update the hotels would show how far away they were from the city you were looking in. The font is too big and doesn't display that pertinent information anymore. Please fix, and it's a 5 star app.

Version 26.0.4 1
 (Slow and inaccurate result) Takes forever the search. the result is confusing and inaccurate.

Version 27.0.1 2
 (Constantly Crashes) Every time I try to filter search results - the app crashes - very frustrating!!!!

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Won't let me search round trip) This new version is useless unless you only want one way tickets.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Kayak pro crashes on opening) Using iOS 7 pro version crashes immediately. I would write a review on the pro site but it crashes before I can do it!

Version 27.0.1 1
 (Kayak pro) The kayak pro app updated today crashes seconds after opening.  Cannot locate in apple apps so I had to post this in the regular kayak app.  I book flights often and used to use this app.  Now I am forced to go elsewhere.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Don't work on iOS version less then 7.0) No support for older OS = bad support

Version 13.0.2 1
 (Crashes every time in iOS 7) Was using this everyday and loved it. Then I updated to ios7 and app won't stop crashing. Unusable. Please fix!!!!!!!!

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Traveling123) I purchased the pro version of Kayak, this app does not work it constantly crashes.  Please fix this app!

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Latest updated App will not even start on iOS 7) Only crashes. It was working fine before this latest update.

Version 23.0.2 2
 (Instant crash in iOS 7) App crashes as soon as it is opened in iOS 7.

Version 26.0.4 1
 (Version 27.1.1 won't open) Crashes immediately ....

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Well designed way to check all your options) Clearly presents your options for flights, hotel, etc and includes taxes in the rates.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Crashes when accessing filters) Since iOS 7, the app crashes when trying to open the Filters. 

Was awesome, now... Not so much.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (What happened to my favorite application?) I search for round trip flights and I can only see the first leg of flights then it asks me to book the flight before I can see the return part of the flight

Also I cannot modify my search now, from example I can't cancel the 2-stop flights from showing up

Please fix this , otherwise I will sadly delete why was once a great applicatikn

Version 26.0.4 3
 (Good) ...

Version 27.0.0 2
 (App crashes) Taping filters causes app to crash

Version 27.0.0 5
 (Hooray! Filters are back!) I just deleted and re-downloaded this app in iOS7, and the filters are working again. Thanks Kayak :) this is my favorite search engine, so having full capability back is delightful.

Version 22.0.1 2
 (Crashes and NO History Search) This is one of my 5 star apps. Every time I attempt to apply the filters, it crashes.  Also I hate the fact that the "History Search" option is missing. Please fix and update ASAP.

Version 27.0.0 2
 (Crashing with filters) Great app, but the latest version crashes when you try to use filters. I am reluctantly headed for the Expedia app right now! Why are you making me do this?

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Bad update.) I love Kayak but it's useless me to since the last update -- crashes every time I hit the filter icon.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Needs help) I used to love this app, this new version crashes every time you try to filter your airfare search results. Also I really like the way it saved your searches for airfare so you could quickly run through your list of searches, now that feature is gone. If it doesn't come back I'll be using a different app for my travel searches.

Version 27.0.0 5
 (Great app & great site) I've used kayak several times to research & purchase flights. I've had great luck every time & it truly is the best pricing at one site. I've compared to every other discount & airline site. Wonderful!

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Kayak for iPhone) Awesome app. Very convenient.

Version 27.0.0 2
 (Crashing...) Having same issue as other reviewers - app crashes in iOS 7 when you try to apply filters. Please fix!

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Crashes when applying filters) This used to be my go-to app for fare searches, but after the latest update, the app crashes every time I try to apply filter to my search results.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Hotel brand search gone) Can't view search by brands anymore! Before you could filter the inpendent hotels and big chains.

Version 27.0.0 3
 (Crashing when tapping filters button) Crashing when tapping filters button

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Big big in 27.0) Good app overall (until this one). Version. 27.0 has a repeatable bug that is too obvious and important to allow a SW to be released:each time you tap on the filter icon (bottom right) the app closes.
So it renders this app unusable, too bad.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Love it) Accurate and lowest prices..

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Filters) Every time I select a filter, the app crashes. Fix!!!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Nice) Great search tool

Version 27.0.0 2
 (Crashes when clicking filter icon) Crashes when you click the filter icon in ios 7.  Disappointing.

Version 27.0.0 3
 (Good interactivity, but new iOS 7 app crashes) The new iOS 7 app crashes whenever I hit the filter button. The app was solidly working before my iOS and app updates.

Version 26.0.4 3
 (Pretty good) I haven't used the app for anything but flights, but I like it. Like the filters.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (iOS 7 Crashing Issues) The update transferred my old filters and now crashes every time I try to undo them.

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Great App) Very clean app- intuitive user interface. Information is relevant and displays quickly. Nice to have a search engine for the major travel websites!

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Crashes) When I try to filter flights, the app crashes every time. Not impressed

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Love it, but iOS7 version crashes) When I apply filters to flight results, it crashes every time.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Will not search correct routes) This app seems to be stuck on searching flights from my last itinerary. Just won't search for requested routes.
Used to be 5 stars...

Version 27.0.0 2
 (Crashing) The app refresh for iOS7 looks nice, but the app continually crashes when I try to apply filters to my search results. Disappointing. I hope that a fix is in the works. There are too many other options available to endure crashes.

Version 27.0.0 2

 (ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤) ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤

Version 27.0.0 1
 (New update crash) The app used to have filters and price alerts capability but since the latest update it doesn't or crashes. What's that about. Please fix as soon as possible.

Even the option for kayak app support doesn't work in the app store, tells me my email address is not valid when it actually is!üò†

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Doesn't work anymore) Doesn't work after update. No results get returned. Just a blank screen.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (Crashes in iOS 7) New version crashes when you select filters.

Version 27.0.0 4
 (Good search tool for trips) Great consolidator for flights and hotels to give you a summary of your options.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Great app) Easy to use, checks multiple sites.

Version 25.0.0 1
 (Don't update) It crashes when you use the filter,

Version 26.0.4 3
 (Distance) Good app but it needs to include the distance. This app would be 5 stars if the DISTANCE was present when looking for a hotel from a certain area.

Version 23.0.0 1
 (Crashes) I love the new layout but the app keeps on crashing when I try to filter the flight results. Please fix this and I'll update my review. Thanks.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Love this app!) Always use this for everything. Super simple and easy to use.

Version 27.0.0 1
 (App is crashing on iOS 7) This app was great but now is crashing when applying the filters. Please fix it!

Version 26.0.2 1
 (Garbage--Get Hipmunk) I travel almost weekly for work and use lots of travel apps. I used Kayak after not using it for a while. I usually use Hipmunk. Kayak is now chuck full of ads that are intermingled with search results making it frustrating and cumbersome to quickly look through results. I deleted it and will stick with Hipmunk. This is an app focused on suckering you into unwanted options rather than just giving you what you want and need. Very poor design.

Version 26.0.4 4
 (Convenient app) Works for flights but had to give 4 because hotel search has been tougher

Version 27.0.0 5
 (Excellent!) Excellent app for your phone and your life!

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Tong) Beautiful

Version 27.0.0 3
 (Misleading... Where's the Dragons?) Great App, but no dragons found...very misleading.  Back to Never-Ending Story!

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Looks great!) Good job, y'all! I'm glad to see some of my favorite apps have made strides to jive with iOS 7. Also awesome - TPS Reports on the packing list. üëç

Version 26.0.4 1
 (Not working?) Using this returns no flights and the filter settings look like they are binary 0 and 1.  Could I be the only iPhone/iPad user with this problem?

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Works great) Easy to use.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Excellent app) Great app

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Outstanding) Allows me to keep track of always changing prices, the chart is amazing, I would recommend this app to anyone trying to get a ticket, don't buy the first time though, set an alert and monitor. On my case best price was 5 days before the flight 50% difference.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Great app) Overall, very functional app. Was very useful with my trip to Austin, TX both finding the flight as well as getting a car rental.

Version 26.0.4 4
 (Satisfactory!!) I'm please with the performance of the app.. It seems to do what is states..

Version 26.0.4 5

Version 26.0.2 5
 (Review) Excellent

Version 26.0.4 5
 (I like!) Always checking to see when I can go to Hawaii... This makes it so much eAsier!!

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Quick, clean, smart) Kayak feels like it's got my best interests in mind rather than being marketing tool for airlines and hotels. Great for finding and tracking travel plans.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Trips feature is amazing) Best travel app by far

Version 26.0.4 4
 (Great) Great overall. If only there's an option for using google maps instead of Apple maps when booking hotels

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Does everything I want it to.) This is my favorite travel app and the only one I need on my phone.

Version 26.0.4 5

 (Love this app!) This app is so easy to use. It's my go to for planning trips.

Version 26.0.4 3
 (Go to ANYWHERE Wanted) I love this app, as well as your website. Use it all the time, but would appreciate a go to anywhere option added into the search functions. Most of us have a set budget and number of days allocable holiday time. Would like to compare cost by destination in deciding where to go.

 (So easy to use) Helpful and easy. One of the best apps around.

Version 26.0.2 3
 (Compare) I like this app because of the speed in giving me quotes. It saves me a lot of time. But I have noticed that there were flights that was cheaper than the ones listed. So I usually check my KAYAK first to compare.

Version 26.0.4 5
 (Easy search) Fast and all ready, just 1 click away

Version 26.0.2 5

Version 26.0.3 1
 (Update ultimately crashes) At first, I tried to update the app through the App Store. Kept getting the message that the update was no longer available for purchase. So, then I deleted the Kayak app and re-downloaded it. That went fine. But now, the app opens for 1 second, then closes. At least I won't need to worry about the update notification in the App Store. Please fix.

 (Great app) Great app. I use this app frequently.

Version 26.0.0 2
 (Buyout to sell out) I've used this app a lot of times in a lot of situations, and it used to rule.  I once used it while stuck on a remote section of the Alaska highway in the Yukon, while traveling by bicycle, with the road washed out on both sides, to switch a flight departure from Anchorage to Prince Rupert.  Didn't matter that my satellited-in Internet was slower than the local glaciers; I waited, it worked.  Ironically, I now live in an area just outside of the sf Bay Area where service is sketchy.  Sometimes I get LTE, often HSPA+, usually just EDGE, sometimes nought.  Since the orbitz buyout and redesign, timeouts have been shortened so instead of waiting and having the app work albeit slowly, it says the flight may have expired and just quits on me.  If this were 13 months ago, I'd have missed my return flight, the best layover and weekend of my life, and possibly my engagement which happened two days later!  Gotta give credit to the old kayak that was slownet-friendly, and disparage the new assumed-fast-connectivity app a little.  It's like designers these days are unwilling to push the limits of where existing tech can be used, and instead design for future tech that leaves the interesting, laudable fringe cases by the wayside.  Stranded, if you will.  In the Yukon.

Version 26.0.0 1
 (Less Efficient Than Website) Missing functionality of the website. Primarily it won't search prices for nearby airports and won't search for flights with flexible dates (+/- 3 days). It also doesn't provide the price trend. Not going to waste my time doing multiple searches with the app when the website does so much more all with a single search.

Version 26.0.0 4
 (Great app, surprisingly good with one suggestion for improvement) I think this might be only my second app review-my first positive one. I have a few apps on my phone for flights for Frugal flyer, cheapo air and such.  They seem to focus on different aspects of travel shopping by comparing different agencies/websites to buy the flight, comparing the different flights themselves, etc. So different ones can be useful for different reasons depending on what type of search you are doing (best place to buy, best flight regardless of where you buy, etc.) and what you're looking for. I found kayak focuses mostly on the flight aspect of the search, grouping flight results by price, times-or whatever you choose for  it to group them by. It is simple to get good results and the convenient options were easy to use. You can search plus or minus your travel date if you're flexible, search nearby airports, etc. My biggest suggestion and one of the few that I can come up with is when searching nearby airports, it would be nice to be able to search nearby airports but also maintain that the same airport you can both fly in to and return to that same airport. I suppose like a closed loop flight in a sense. That way I can look at prices for leaving out of nearby airports without thinking "okay, how am I going to get back to my car when I fly home into a different airport?" While that may be a cheaper route to go for the flight, it costs extra for the shuttle and is inconvenient so maybe an option to allow "flying home into a different airport" in your search results would be nice. Otherwise it's a great app that surprised me. I hear they also have a pro version which would be neat to check out, too. God bless and happy searching! :)

 (Awesome!) I've used the Kayak app for several reservations and am quite pleased with it. Window views are not always ideal once you get to the reservation part of the process, but that seems to be an interface issue between Kayak and the many companies they deal with. If those pages were adapted to fit the frame, I would be happier.

Version 26.0.0 1
 (Don't understand why people like this) This app will give you many good deals and then redirect you to purchase. I try to purchase using the Orbitz option through this app, but you will not be able to because the purchase button is covered by other buttons in the app. This renders the app completely useless.

Version 25.0.1 3
 (Inaccurate fares) The feature that allows one to find fares to anywhere in the world using certain filters (desired travel months etc.) will find a teaser fare then disappear one click later.  The actual fares are nowhere close to what is displayed.  This is a HUGE bug and needs to be repaired.  It makes one wonder how many other programming mistakes are in this software.

Version 25.0.1 5

 (Terrible) App won't even open. Keep crashing as of 6/4 on iPhone 5. Reinstalled and restarted phone also. Garbage, don't get.

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Best search engine got flights) To get the quick idea on flight costs and being able to see multiple airlines and trips using multiple airlines, kayak does an amazing job. With the exceptions of jet blue and southwest , which you have to visit separately for rates, kayak delivers the best prices and layovers. Always use them to book or at least always start here.

 (Air fare) Awesome application!!!!!!

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Kayak booked my trip) I use to use it solely for keeping track of my itinerary while on travel, but I have found that it is much much more. I recently booked my flights and my hotel using the app and I am very happy with the features it offers. I am able to lock in flights that I otherwise could not lock in with the airlines 3rd party site. No matter how many times I searched the flight...Kayak did not inflate the cost like other websites do. I will use them again!

Version 25.0.1 5

 (Great) Perfect app

Version 25.0.1 4

Version 25.0.1 5

Version 25.0.1 4
 (Very nice) Well designed. Can save searches.  Doesn't crash. Would like more filters (for hotels, do they have a pool or serve breakfast, etc.).

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Excellent!!) Accurate, fast, and simple.

Version 25.0.1 1
 (Useless) Search of flights takes forever, results are cryptic, layover airports labeled only w cryptic 3 letter abbreviations. Even after looking at the flight details still have no idea which city my layover is in. How about listing the city next to each airport designation? Eg LAX, Los Angeles. Or BUR, Burbank CA.) other similar issues. Could've been done better.

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Great results!) Love it!

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Great app) A lot of functionality and easy to use. They are more timely than the airlines and airports on delays!  Good info without making you jump through a lot of hoops.

Version 25.0.1 1
 (Unsatisfied) This app does nothing to help me. I can call the airport and have them give me better ticket prices then I can find them on here. I don't see any reason for anyone to use this app if they say they can get the best deals out there and they never have the best deal. I will never use this app again.

 (Excellent App to organize frequent Travel.) Good prices and deals are only the starting points for the Kayak APP.  What I like the most is its ability to put the entire trip in the calendar including flights, car rentals , hotels etc and alert you thru SMS. Alerts also on flight delays , gate changes etc.  A must have for frequent travelers.

Version 25.0.1 5
 (One of my most used apps) One stop shop for planning all travel details. I use it weekly.

Version 25.0.1 5

 (Inaccurate and useless) I have been searching for flights from Abe to Portland then Bozeman back to Abe. Results come in ok but are never accurate. When I try to book with united the cost is always $100 more per ticket and the flights are never the same. Don't waste your time on this app or this company. UPDATE: kayak is still returning false results for flights- on 5/19 kayak returned a result for Allentown to Portland and Bozeman to Allentown in August for 628 but when going thru to delta to book it timed out then I went to delta web site and the same flight is over $800. Kayak is useless at best and misleading and wasteful at worst. Don't waste your time!

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Amazing App) Super features

Version 25.0.1 1
 (Awful) Shows you flights and prices that are great but when you try to book always get a "flights just sold out" on any and ALL of the options you try. VERY DISAPPOINTING.

Version 25.0.1 4
 (Great app) It is great app and I would recent it for anybody

Version 25.0.1 4
 (Convenient) Loved that I didn't have to go online and search everyday. A travel agent could have done that for me but I like to be in control. Wish the selection to book from app was easier. Had to enter all flight info again on airline website. I went to airline from computer instead. But this app kept me informed. Def must for travelers.

Version 25.0.1 5

 (Kayak) Great app. Kayak is an awesome site and the app is super easy to use- great service!

Version 25.0.1 3
 (Kayak-Vayama) In the past 6 months, all flights  I have tried to purchase (totaling 3) with the Kayak-Vayama partnership have not been successful. Other flights purchased, such as through Kayak-Travelocity, have been fine. The wait between notifications is ridiculous just to see whether or not my purchase is successful. How does Vayama not know what flights are available and for what prices?? Shouldn't they be required to verify this before posting on Kayak? It's a waist of time, especially as I watch to make sure my credit card is credited back the money. Disappointed in Kayak.

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Fast and easy) Works just fine and really easy to use. Just what apps are supposed to be.

Version 25.0.1 3

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Excellent app) My trips feature is great. It imported my trips perfectly.

Version 25.0.1 1
 (Not helpful if traveling) I'm sure it works great if you only ever look in one city per trip but if you try to look up multiple cities along your route it DOES NOT work.

I do not recommend this app!

 (The best) They just have the best price!

Version 25.0.1 3
 (Good but..) Great app but don't like the fact that the prices are higher simply because I am using an apple product!It is true and i verified it. So use a PC so you don't get charged more.

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Ease and variety) Great interface and fantastic variety. Recommend!

Version 25.0.1 4

 (Great app) A very well developed app. Easy to use and very helpful in finding hotels, flights and car rentals

Version 25.0.1 5

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Great app) One of the easiest to get info from

Version 25.0.1 5

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Love it) Sometimes I  get a better deal here than buying it with the airline carrier.

Version 25.0.1 5

 (Great app!) Very complete and it has many ways to sort through searches. Does not crash and it remembers your recent searches

 (Easy to Use) Very efficient app. Easy to use, all flight options at your fingertips

Version 25.0.1 4
 (Need more time to form a better opinion) I only used the app for half an hour but already found hotels at 1/3 of the price as the other travel sites at one of the busiest and most expensive travel times of the year. So far very helpful...

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Very handy with my fast paced traveling lifestyle) Since I need to know things as I'm on the move, this is perfect. I can do everything on my phone and I love it. This is great for my lifestyle.

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Practical, gets the job done) Relative to other travel / booking apps this one does all: car , hotel, flights.  I find it hard to understand why other well known travel COs are so behind in this regard.  Good job Kayak.

Version 25.0.1 5
 (NICE!) Love this APP!

Version 25.0.1 5

 (Buggy and painful -- problems with seniors) The app does not allow up front to select a senior but catches it later after all information is entered. Then, unfortunately it blanks out information when it assists you to fix and you have to enter it all over again. Then you find out the data has to be refreshed and lose information again. Then it tells you the flight is no longer available.

Version 25.0.1 5

 (Great app!) Good work!

Version 25.0.1 5

Version 25.0.1 4

Version 25.0.1 4
 (Good, but could be better) Overall a good app for a great site. However, I wish there was a way to filter flights by frequent flyer program, like the site allows.

 (Limited info) App works fine, lacking information about car rentals. The app only gives information on car rentals near or in the airport. Because of that my activity with this app has been lowered significantly.

Version 25.0.1 1

Version 25.0.0 4
 (Cabo bound!!!) I really like this app!  I'm currently looking for flights for a trip I'm taking in July so I really like the option to create notifications for numerous dates and/or departure cities. The downside to the alert is that it only seems to tell you the pricing that comes out early that morning because there are times I've clicked on it to look at current pricing and cheaper options pop up so I wish it would update throughout the day so I wouldn't have to go the extra steps to make sure the pricing is correct. I've even tried the refresh button on the alert page but it doesn't seem to do anything. All that said, I really like the app and love that kayak is my one stop shop when planning a trip.

Version 25.0.0 5
 (Love it) This is the first place to look! Just wish they had every airline.

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Kayak- awesome travel tool) Can't live with out it! None better!

Version 25.0.1 1
 (Alerts are terrible) Signed up and got all these emails about there being no price change. Checked the hotel sites myself to find there were changes and availability. So if I had relied solely on Kayak, I would have missed out on saving $350 on accommodations. Deleted.

Version 25.0.0 4
 (Great!) Easy to use! Great app

Version 25.0.1 5
 (Love Kayak) It's super awesome. Fast and on the go just as I need. I can book flights instantly where ever I am finding the cheapest, best flights out. It's the best thing every for me.

 (It just works well) Kayak is the easiest and fastest way to search and book travel. The Interface is clean and easy to use.  Two stellar features are: 1. the ability to save searches in your account, and pin flights that you want to buy.  and 2.  the "My trips" feature is simply awesome.  By sending an email of your itinerary to Kayak, it reads the email and saves all the relevant data to your account.  Now all my trip info is located in one convenient place - my phone.  I also LOVE that they will send updates and trip warnings to my email.  Thank you for such a great product! keep up the good work

 (Excelente app) Es una excelente herramienta para cualquier persona que viaja sin importar que tan frecuente lo haga. 

Adem√°s de todas las bondades de kayak, te permite tambi√©n concentrar toda tu informaci√≥n de viaje en un solo lugar, env√≠a alertas y hasta contiene una secci√≥n para ayudarte a empacar. 

Lo √∫nico que le falta, es poder fusionar eventos en un solo viaje desde la misma aplicaci√≥n (como Tripcase) en lugar de que sea desde la p√°gina web, espero que pronto este disponible.

Would be nice if they had a flag or button that let you know about each site provider's fare-matching policies if the price does indeed drop. 

When looking for places, I use TripAdvisor. When I actually book, Kayak.

Version 13.0.2 2
 (Poor. Very poor) I was in a hurry to reschedule a flight due to bad weather. I entered the date and destination but got many other dates, beyond my desired one. I accidentally chose the wrong date and now I'm stuck with a wrong ticket. If only Kayak app had the option to select EXACT DATES ONLY, I wouldn't have been in this mess. Thanks for nothing Kayak, thanks a lot!

Version 25.0.0 5
 (Love Kayak and their app) Easy to use

Version 25.0.0 3
 (Pretty good, but...) Overall, app is good.  I like when you can book directly from kayak and not to another site, which you can't do with all airlines kayak shows.  I wish you could see southwest prices, and sometimes the app will not load flights correctly, defaulting the dates to July 6 and 7 for some reason, randomly.  It's happened a few times, but an uninstall and reinstall of the app fixes it.  Otherwise, great app, and it is free.  I use this as my default over the orbitz app.

Version 25.0.0 4
 (That's great) Very easy to see

Version 25.0.0 5

 (They suk) They don't not stand by their word. I book a room, went to check in and room was never booked and hotel was full. Called kayak they verified said they give me a full refund in 5-7 days and I would need to book a new room at a new hotel almost double the cost, I had to drive home at 12:30 am almost 2 1/2 hrs away cuz I was out of money and they did not care. Bottom line this company is horrible!!!!

Version 25.0.0 5
 (Wonderful) I'm only nine but I travel a lot so get the app it's worth it!!!

 (Irritating.) Kayak app used to be awesome.  Now every time I search for a flight it tells me 0 out of 0 results.  This has been happening for at least two weeks.  I thought it needed an update but there is not one available.  I'm certainly not buying the paid version of this app.  I'll use my computer.

What junk.

Version 24.0.1 3
 (Kayak-iztan) The app is not as friendly as the regular site. Price alerts are sporadic at updating prices, hacker fares don't exist on the mobile app, a lot of extra steps to check flights +/- 1day.  The app is better than some others but far from superior.

Version 24.0.1 2
 (No option to search for kids) It's a handy app if you're only traveling with adults. Needs a kid/infant option for the flights.

Version 24.0.1 2
 (Misleading Prices) Searched for tickets to Ireland and found a great deal, half of what I expected to pay. Three hours later, I went to buy the tickets and the price was triple what the app had said. I didn't even create a new search, I just refreshed the listings. Clearly the app has some major issue, definitely odidn't work for me.

 (False price) It shows different price in the list, and when I would buy it it turns out its way more than what it was shown first

Version 24.0.1 4
 (Fast -- well organized) Great resource on the road. Not sure how prices are determined because every time I called the hotels directly the prices were markedly lower. Didn't book thru Kayak for that reason.

Version 23.0.2 5
 (Best Travel App Ever!) As a business owner, educator and a person with lots of family spread all over the US who travels a lot, I have used many flight, hotel and car rental apps, but never has one been as totally comprehensive, easy to use, effective and awesome as KAYAK!

Version 24.0.1 5
 (Great app) I am getting married and moving to Florida and have to travel a lot the next couple months.. This app is so easy to use and helpful!

Version 24.0.1 1
 (Your app is whack!) Your app has prices that are advertised that aren't accurate. I had 2 tickets confirmed and was on PayPal to purchase for $310. Kayak would not let me approve purchase because they wanted me to buy flight insurance that I hit No Thanks on. Then the prices go up from $310 to $470 while I keep hitting No thanks on Insurance. I am deleting this app & going back to cheap tickets for my travels. Kayak is a disorganized Waste of time & energy

Version 24.0.1 5
 (Excellent for full time travelers.) As an airline employee I find this app more accurate and timely than what my airline provides me.   International travel deserves a bit more attention however.

Version 24.0.1 5

 (Best one I've found for hotels and flights!) The app has a beautiful and functional interface. Actually kind of fun to use. Also in the app it shows prices on numerous sites and will link you directly to the site you pick (lowest price) if you choose to book thru them instead of kayak.

Version 24.0.1 5
 (Love it) Love this app

Version 24.0.1 5

 (Great app) Great app minus you can't put in traveler info for children. Had to open full website to do so.

Version 24.0.1 3
 (Ugh) Great for searching prices, but if you use the app to go to airlines site and purchase, you can't use back browser if you click on a link. You lose all progress and have to start over again. I tried twice already to purchase a ticket and I am still unsure if the transaction went through. Frustrating

Version 24.0.1 5
 (Kayak) Awesome

Version 24.0.1 5
 (Mr mark) Great app !

Version 24.0.1 1
 (Long way to go) App is just bad

Version 24.0.1 5

Version 24.0.1 5
 (Kayak) Great app, easy to use and powerful.

Version 24.0.1 5

Version 24.0.1 5
 (Great!) Very useful!

 (Okay) Not great

Version 23.0.2 4
 (Plane App) Good App to check flight options quickly for business trips.

Version 24.0.1 5
 (As powerful as the Site) The failing of most mobile apps which are derivatives of desktop full site experiences is when they leave out most of the key features that make the desktop web so cool. This app doesn't make any compromises but instead covers them all plus a few cool things that only mobile lets you have. Enthusiastic 5 stars!

Version 24.0.1 5
 (Kayak App) Terrific App for my iPhone.  In my opinion, the best app for searching flights.

Immediately tried to use it for trip plans in March 2013. Was overtly impressed by ease in use, ability to filter & sort by travel options and found Kayak to offer even more options than the formerly used Expedia & for more reasons than I might rightfully name here! Lastly, for someone who believes I'm technologically disabled when it comes to trying new hi-tech options or apps, again I found this so easy to use that I was not at all intimidated ;)!!

 (Came through in the clutch!) Flights are overpriced, Megabus was sold out, last resort was renting a car. My friends checked multiple websites but we couldn't find a rental car we could take a one-way trip with out-of-state. So I decided "I finally have a reason to use Kayak!" Low and behold Kayak found us several cars that we could drive out-of-state that were well within our budget! Crazy thing is that they were all from the same companies that tried to charge us MORE in the beginning! I am more than satisfied :) Oh and the price they give you? Taxes were already included #win

Version 23.0.2 2
 (Flight Tracker Feature Unreliable) I primarily used this app to track flight status & gate changes.  Unfortunately, it's been slow to notify or doesn't notify at all any last minute gate changes.  On several recent occasions, I found myself sitting at what I thought was the correct gate only to find out that the gate was changed 15-20 minutes beforehand. So I will instead rely on the old fashion method of reading the flight status screens at the airport.

 (Awesome Travel App) Almost as good as the website. Better than any other travel iOS app I have found.

 (Yippie KAYAK!) Well produced. Good information other than just flights, hotels and cars. Easily navigated. Some thought went into this.

Version 23.0.2 5
 (The best app for tickets and rent a car) I am using kayak for two years and of course compare prices of the tickets from other sources too but so far the cheapest prices I can find are only here at kayak!

Version 23.0.2 2
 (Misleads , compares Apples to Oranges) Why is Kayak posting misleading fares? For example, my husband just booked 2 fares on Spirit Airlines, based on Kayak's pricing. He wasn't told by the app he would pay almost $200 more for checking bags, using the counter assistance, etc. It is criminal! Misleading! And Kayak is responsible. Compare Apples to Apples, please the airline pricing system is confusing enough without Kayak omitting crucial details like the cost of a ticket WITH ONE BAG CHECKED. Please. Make listed prices reflect the same perks for every airline, create a standard for comparison and use it.

Version 23.0.2 5
 (Better than the Web site) The Kayak app is an interesting example of an app that is actually better than its Web site companion.

Version 23.0.2 5
 (Best mobile travel app) The simplest, cleanest interface of any of the travel apps. Best in class.

Version 23.0.2 4
 (Good for planning flights) I

Version 23.0.2 5
 (Desperate need to get away) This app not only helped me get the best flight prices but also the hotel prices. Came home for the holidays and as many know family time can get uncomfortable so I need a much sooner flight back to New York and a hotel for the next two nights in Chicago.

Version 23.0.2 5

 (Simple and cool. Intl airfare alert glitches) Love the app and the UI. Slick and simple and clear. 

Price alerts setup is confusing though and prone to errors. Email. Notification. Daily. Weekly. Ugh. Show me a simple list.

Version 23.0.2 3
 (Results are awful) Everytime I pick the lowest priced flight, it sends me to the 3rd party site and says "flight no longer available at this price, it's now 1200 (basically 300 more). It does this everytime. In fact. If you don't believe me , try this search right now. 
Seattle to Bangkok January 18th 2013 with return flight feb 1st. It'll say $878 but you can't actually get that price. Ridiculous.

Version 23.0.2 5
 (Such a great productivity tool!) Love this app!

Version 23.0.2 2
 (Limited Functionality) I just got this app for my 3rd generation iPad thinking It would be great. My first search, I tried looking up a flight from Detroit to Boise. Everything was smooth.. Then.

All search results were locked in Euro currency only. 
The Options/Settings button is blank and doesn't work. 
My search showing roughly a 350‚Ç¨ ticket price is actually 1400‚Ç¨ when I click to buy ticket. O_O What?!
When I go to put in my address America or U.S. isn't even an option. 

I think I'll just stop using the app and use the actual website until these issues are resolved.

 (Kayak = iOS Travel!) Kayak is a must have iOS app for travel!  Whenever there is a flight I need to get a quote for, I head over to Kayak. It shows me all the competitive prices and even includes the airline's fees. It can remember your info and auto fill the booking info (if you set it to). Also, the fact that they optimized for iPhone 5 makes it even better. I would definitely recommend.

Version 22.0.1 5

 (Not as good as the old Kayak HD) My trusty Kayak HD iPad app just told me it was being retired and I had to download the new Kayak app. What a disappointment! The new app is all about wasted space and doesn't show anywhere near as much information as the old app.

For example, Kayak HD showed me a map of the locations, so I knew I had the right airport. Kayak HD fit 15 results on a screen, now just 6.

 (Hero to zero) This is one of those companies that had a great idea and some help in execution a while ago and now fast declining in all aspects (i guess they only do one thing, gather all travel search engines and present a list at one place). The results are inaccurate and web/mobile apps are very poorly tested , i travel every week and started to use hipmunk and individual airlines sites than this stupidity called kayak. 

Just a small advice, instead of modifying interfaces every month concentrate on the content quality. No one asked you to change the UI once a month. How can i search an itinerary from DC to ATL with inclusion on nearby airports and get one search results and you filter out another 250 results without me touching any other button.

Version 23.0.2 4

 (Fast and simple) I'm on a road trip coast to coast and so far this has been the best alternative to google, which has more info but also not as streamlined

Version 23.0.2 3
 (Good searches, spotty booking) The app is great for finding good prices and sorting through options. The one problem is glitches that seem to happen too often when booking flights, hotels, and such. A number of times I have gotten to the very end of a booking, and the app (the web site does it too) hangs for a lengthy period of time seemingly to confirm the reservation. After some period of time a message pops up saying something to the effect that an error occurred and to try again later. That's aggravating enough it isn't always necessarily true that the reservation wasn't booked. Sometimes the booking did occur and the error message was... well IT was the error. One time I responded to the error message by going back through the booking process only to end up with two identical reservations on an airline. Luckily the airline didn't put a fuss when I asked them to cancel one of the reservations.

 (Problems lately) Great app. But iPhone version does not update changes from Kayak site unless you log out of mobile version and the log back in.  What's with that?  Definitely not OK. 

Editing rental car reservations in My Trips doesn't accept the changes. When I change the price and Save, it reverts back to the old price. Not acceptable. 

This used to be a five star app. Now, it's not even close. Too many hoops to jump through.

Downloaded free Tripit. Forwarded itinerary. Voila! In Tripit. 

Checked email and saw reply from Walter. Needed to logout and log back in. Itinerary in Kayak.

Would give this 6 stars for Walter. Art company. Hate auto email saying I will hear from someone in 24 hours. When I deal with a technology problem I get impatient. Thank you Kayak for your great app, customer service model and Walter!

Version 23.0.0 4
 (Simple app, beautiful interface) Honestly very few people have time to search in depth for fares from their phone that they wouldn't just go and grab a laptop so I love that this app makes quick and thorough/ comprehensive  searches for fares and hotels easy and shareable in a few seconds.  I like that filters come after the main search to make the initial search easy.  Other apps restrict you to less carriers or they over complicate the search.  If you want complicated that's cool.  But I'd you want simple an quick this apps for you.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Very easy to use) Information at your fingertips in seconds.  Love it.

 (Kayak is great!) Definitely a wonderful app for finding hotels and flights!

Version 23.0.0 3
 (Needs some fixing) For example, when searching for cars with automatic transmission- with option selected in app- still yields results with manual transmission. Generally the app is not sufficient for my needs and I end up going to the website. Wish the two were fully in sync with the same features and functionality.

 (Great Travel companion) The Kayak team never ceases to amaze. This is by far one of the best travel apps in the iTunes store. I specially dig the trip planner feature.

Version 23.0.0 3
 (Great on iPad, not in iPhone) Works great on my iPad, but the iPhone app constantly crashes and can't complete a search without crashing.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Thanks Kayak) Got a great deal on tickets to Brazil.

Version 23.0.0 3
 (Helpful, but just ok) It fairly easy to search... Just finding the time to get on the computer and do it would be faster tho. Good for planning and ideas, not really for when you actually have to find a ticket.

Version 23.0.0 2
 (Price Alert) Good app but the feature I wanted the most does work. Price Alert will not update any prices.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Class Reunion) Thanks to kayak I could get to my class reunion... Prices were good

Version 23.0.0 4
 (Great travel app) Book all my flights using Kayak!

Version 23.0.0 4
 (Works as advertised) I have only used this app for looking for flights but the interface is slick and let's you apply many filters that I find useful. Voting 4 stars because when selecting what time you want flights to takeoff/land it incorrectly displays the order airport names (I.e. it will say "Indianapolis to New York City" twice, when one of them should read "New York City to Indianapolis")

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Still hasn't crashed even once) Still hasn't crashed even once

I've suggested to friends - they are hooked now too. 
Only thing left is to travel more!

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Awesome app) Wonderful app that works perfect.

Version 23.0.0 4
 (Great for booking on the go) As our office's resident travel agent, I find myself needing to book travel at all hours. The kayak app lets me do that -as long as I've got service - from wherever.  I wish you could set up filter choices from the very beginning, and it's a little tedious to get to flight details, but otherwise, it's very intuitive and user friendly.

Worth downloading. You won't regret it!

Version 23.0.0 4
 (Efficient) Most outstanding app

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Kayak mobile app is great) I love this mobile app.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Kayak) Love this app!  The only downfall is that you have to know airport abbreviation.  Other than that fantastic!!!

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Used Daily) With our family of four traveling/flying a few times each year, it sure is nice to have a daily notification as to our desired destinations. When I see a price drop, I'm sure to jump on it saving us a few dollars to use elsewhere on our vacation.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Great interface) Props to the kayak mobile team for putting together a great app. I find the interface very well suited to your product, without a lot of clutter. The loading time is fantastic for the amount of requests you make to check flights. Only really use this for flights, so take this review with that in mind.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Love the app) I had rather use the app than the web site for air travel.

Version 22.0.2 5

 (Helpful) Great app to have.. Makes things so much easier

Version 23.0.0 2
 (Good and bad) The hotel map works great...but I hate that you cannot narrow down a price range more. It would only let me set it from $40 to over $300.  In paris, France that leave tons of hotels to sift though. Ugh

Version 23.0.0 5

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Hotel) Awesome

Version 23.0.0 1
 (Waste of time) If you find a cheap flight and you click to book, you will find that the flight is no longer available. It's a way to get you to visit orbitz or cheaptickets. This happened to me no fewer than fifteen times this evening. Was eventually able to book using Hotwire.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (No other app like it.) Easy to use. Quick results. Life saver.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Kayak!) This is a great app. All your travel needs met in one place! That is awesome.

Version 23.0.0 5

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Kayak app is good) It's good and better than many of these kind.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Good) Some one told me about this app. Love it

Version 23.0.0 5
 (5 star) Awesome 

(Now don't let it get to your head and messing it all up. As so many apps have a tendency to do when they get good. )

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Kayak) Easy to use and quick results.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Yay Kayak!) Easy to understand and operate this app, so I like it. Not much to say, seems to be one of the best apps to set up a plane flight or anything dealing with travel.

Version 23.0.0 4
 (Better than the real think) I don't enjoy using Kayak on my laptop but love this app!!!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Waw) I like it

Version 23.0.0 3
 (Great app, but don't get the alerts) I think this is one of the best apps out there for any category because it allows you to do everything the website can do. How many web companies can boast that? And kayak is great for flights, hotels (I just got rid of expedia's hotel app because kayak works better), travel plans (I also don't use tripit anymore), etc. So great app. 

The reason I'm giving it only three stars is that the flight alerts that kayak emails you (a service that you'd think is very useful) will send you prices that someone else got beforehand and are probably no longer available. How absurd is that. I mean, seriously, how can that possibly be useful? I like Bing Travel because they have a price predictor to tell you if prices are likely to go up or down. I like the idea of getting alerts to find out when prices go down. But Kayak's implementation is idiotic.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Travel maniac) Love tis app, makes travel bargain shopping so easy, ditto air bookings!!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Very User Friendly) One of the best apps our there. Very user friendly!!!

Version 23.0.0 4
 (Review of Kayak) This is an excellent very useful travel app which keeps getting better and better. I use it to contact airlines, to book and compare fares, etc.  I hope the developers keep improving and refining it in the months ahead.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Best Travel App- PennySaver) Can't travel without it. Great for 'onthespot' decisions and preplanning. Thanks KAYAK!!!!

Version 22.0.2 4
 (KAYAK) I Love  KAYAK

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Excellent Travel App) It's very easy to use, lists the best prices from many sites, and includes all fees.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Good) Easy to use!

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Just one addition and it will be perfect!) When you go to price alerts > then edit, it only gives you the option to delete a flight you want to be alerted for, you need to add the option to shift them around and move them, because I'm trying to find a cheap flight from several different airports in both places so I need to be more organized!! Please update!

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Kayak) App works great. Makes it easy to check pricing by autofilling in forms.

 (The great and excellent site.) Excellent.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Best app ever) I love this app. It is very handy i like to travel  so this app is for me.
Keep up the good work. (MAX)

Version 23.0.0 3
 (The filter on the cars won't "filter") I go thru and click my wants in the filter and click apply. Then, all the stuff I didn't want appears.... What's the use of a filter if it doesn't work?

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great app!) Easy to used. Has the best prices. I just love it. I recommend ;)‚òùüëç

Version 23.0.0 1
 (Can't find airports) No matter what I type in, a city name or the three letter airport code, it doesn't find anything when I search. Currently useless to me.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (I don't review Apps, but kayak deserves it!) I've been using Kayak for years to book flights; this app has made it even easier! Search for airfare deals on the go? Yes please!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Me) Love it!!!!!!!

Version 23.0.0 4

Haven't had a chance to compare and contrast, but it is quick and convenient.

Version 23.0.0 5

Version 23.0.0 5
 (MD) Great App......love it, love it, love it!!!!!!

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Amazing) Very nice!!

Version 23.0.0 1
 (Please fix) Ever since the last update, the app has real difficulty connecting to search for cities.  Forget about multi-city search. This app is pretty much worthless now. What happened, kayak?

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Great app) Best one I've found and easiest one to use

Version 22.0.2 5
 (It's great) I love this app!

Version 22.0.2 4
 (The best travel app I've used to date) Minor flaws in the ticket equation software prevented me from giving this app 5 *, (ie. When making flight routes for multiple destinations the price is excessively inflated as opposed to selecting and purchasing the same flights individually) but all in all the app is very helpful in helping plan a trip and getting an idea of what to expect.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Smooth) AWESOME!!!

Version 23.0.0 1
 (Used to be my go-to app for hotels) Now after recent updates, it's barely useable.  Very disappointed.

Version 23.0.0 1
 (Nothing loads and you have to search for the real price.) Want to know if the airline is going to cost you 60$ for bag fees?  Goodluck!

Version 23.0.0 1
 (Fix it) The car rental sorting is crashing please fix it

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Great and easy) Very easy to use. Very quick and convenient.

 (Cool app) Great

Version 23.0.0 2
 (7-11) I don't find any good deal from them any time ......

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Great) Best travel app anywhere, simple and very intuitive. I will be using it for all my travels from now on! Only wish is the search to be a little more broad, I.E. typing in a country should give a list of airports instead of... No results.      EDIT..... Love the new features, the HUGE hotel address is a great idea and I will use it often. That said there is room to expand, perhaps a currency converter would be a good thing to add so you know how much the fare is going to cost?

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Excellent! Great UI!) Love that it works for airlines/ flights in India as well!

Version 23.0.0 5
 (Awesome!) Easy to use, love it!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great) Works just absolutely awesome.

Version 23.0.0 5
 (LOVE THIS APP!) It has everything you need- price alerts, airline contact info, baggage fee info, and of course a great search engine for flights

Version 23.0.0 1
 (False flight tracking information) I foolishly relied on the app for information about when my girlfriend's 1.5hr flight would arrive, and found while waiting at the airport that it had been delayed 40 minutes longer than the app had claimed. It only updated to display the correct information after the alleged arrival time had passed. Disgraceful.

Version 23.0.0 1
 (Not working) Since the last update (07/31) app doesn't even load. Crashes after boot screen. Same thing happened with Kayak Pro.

Version 23.0.0 5

Version 22.0.2 1
 (AWFUL APP) This app does not give all flight options! Leaves out multiple airline options. I was stressing out because Kayak was listing flights to NYC at $1400 but I found WAY cheaper flights once I used other search engines. I'm deleting this app right away.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Excellent) Current and accurate information.

Version 22.0.2 4

 (Fantastic app) I love Kayak, and this application makes Traveling and finding the best prices all over the world so easy. I highly recommend this app for research and booking at your fingertips!

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Usefully) Nice App

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Just okay) Got this primarily for Flight Tracker.  App a little draggy, not much detail on flight status.  Doesn't tell distance travelled or distance to go.  Was also WAY behind actual flight, by almost 20 minutes.  (Didn't show departure was delayed by half hour).  But absolute worst of all, flight tracker didn't automatically update.  Had to keep hitting refresh to get "latest" (20 minutes behind) location.  I expected better, and have seen a lot better from PC apps.  But, it's free, and not a total bomb.  Maybe upgrades or better collaboration with flight data providers in the future will make this app worthwhile.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Pricing) Great deals

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Love everything about this app) Used to use skyscanner, but this app is so much better. One improvement I'd suggest is keeping a filter activated when searching through different days or airports. For example, if I only want to see flights departing after 2 pm, then I don't want to keep applying the filter when I change an airport or date.

Other than that, I'm obsessed!

 (Best booking app) Use lots of different apps to book travel. This is the best.  By far. Love it.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (The best) The best el mejor

Version 22.0.2 1
 (What happened?) It used to be the best app to compare airfares, however for about a week I just can't search for any cities (airport or city for car rental). The search doesn't pop up any result: I can't select my origin and destination. The app has Internet connection as I can perform a search if I keep the current field values (and I get different prices for different airlines).
Please fix ASAP!
Update: I'm in Hong Kong and the issue has been ongoing for several months now!
Update 2: When I use a VPN to get a US internet access, the app works fine. So basically when connecting from Hong kong, the app can't retrieve cities list....

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Super App) I m from outside US and it works good for me... Nice travel assistant...

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Waste of time) Ok. I love this website and have purchased all my flights from it for the last few years (6-7 flights).

 (Flexible Date Search Archaic) If you know your exact dates, this app is great. If you're flexible want a calendar that shows cheaper flights, try TripAdvisor. I can't believe Kayak left that feature out of this app.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Great app with one glaring omission) This app is easy to use and book from. The one huge omission when compared to their full website is the lack of "flexible" dates feature. If this feature were ported to the app in a later release, then this would merit 5 stars.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Kayak is best) Thanks

Version 22.0.2 4
 (A great Tool for any traveler) The more you use Kayak the better the information becomes.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Reviews old) The only thing it's missing is up-to-date reviews

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great) Its just good! The first thing i did after downloaded was book a flight and so far impressed!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Works great!) Perfect. Works as advertised. No issues.

 (Easy to use) Saves me lots of time digging for the best rates

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Best) My go-to app for traveling.

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Car rental search needs work) When searching for car rentals, the results do not indicate the details of the car. For example, I'm looking for car rentals in Europe and there is no indication as to whether it is a manual or automatic transmission until after leaving the Kayak  application and going to the website itself. Time waster....

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great app) Great app

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Good app) Works fast

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Mr) Good job this was real easy to use

Version 22.0.2 5
 (AWESOME!) It is great! By now the best traveling app I have used!

Version 22.0.2 4
 (I like to pretend...) I pick random destinations and see if kayak can get me a ticket for less than what I have in my checking account.  It usually finds me some place interesting and then I log off and go buy groceries.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (It's awesome!!!!!!.......) I love using this app I get  great deals on nice suites for a reasonable price it's awesome!!!!!!!!........

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great App!!!) Getting lots of info at my finger tips.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Wish you could add trips in app...) As it is now, the only way you can add trips is to book something, but you can add custom trips on the website. Adding custom trips to the app would make it perfect.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great!) So easy to use, which is awesome when on a phone!

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Nice travel app) Awesome app. I use it all the time.

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Could be MUCH improved!!) This app should get 2 1/2 stars but that wasnt an option. It is helpful but when trying to book flights it becomes overly repetitive when having to type in the same info over and over again. It's a decent app, but it is less user friendly then others out there.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Easy) Love it

Version 22.0.2 2
 (Good) Good

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great App Saves $$$) Kayak is a great app, it works very well and is very fast, gotta say one of the best apps that I have seen in some time. Would recommend it to anybody.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Very good experience

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Easy search but every quote is wrong!) So...when you link to the airline from the kayak quote, the price is $400 more! Sketchy

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Seriously impressed with Kayak!!) I love this app. I have booked several trips and adventures through the kayak app and it is the best I have used. Nothing like seeing all the options in one place. Thank you for investing in such an engaging app!!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great) Easy and quick to find a flight and hotel

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Sleek and elegant way to search flights) This app presents flight schedules, hotel rates, and car rentals in such a way that you'll want to book it immediately. This is mainly because of its sleek design and very simple approach on navigating through its interface. However, if i were to choose between Kayak and Skyscanner, I'll definitely choose the latter.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (So easy and fast to find the best flights) I have not found another flight searcher that is so easy to use and consistently finds the best values. The app is fast and I love the travel organizer options.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Ok) Ok

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great) It has everything i need!

Version 22.0.2 2
 (Nice search, but booking is very hit and miss) Searching is very nice, one of the best, but booking is a very frustrating experience. While trying to book a flight I eventually gave up. I had entered all my information and when I went to book I had to wait and wait and wait and then had to re-enter my information. Very frustrating.

 (Add more) Better to have more categories ie food ,POI etc.

Version 22.0.2 5

 (Kayak) Pretty dumb. It never work right

 (Awesome app) Terrific app. Better then the computer experience!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great tool) I use this app for business more than anything and at times for personal. 
Great tool for me the way I use it. I don't use it to book the rooms, flights but rather keep track if the bookings through this app and to help me get pricing.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Helpful app) To travel

Version 22.0.2 1
 (I just lost $650 for searching and booking through this app.) BEWARE: The flight search result that you see listed is totally for DIFFERENT DATE than what you originally selected. So be very careful, always keep an eye on the date until you purchase tickets.

The problem occurs because we are used to taking for granted that  once we choose exact dates while searching for flights, we tend to ignore the dates and concentrate on price and timing in  the search result. But this app "automatically" assumes that we are searching for flexible dates and gives the best price for a different date than what you originally wanted for. Although it shows the date in the results, most likely it will  be for a different day, often we ignore to look at it carefully. Please be extremely careful if you want to use this app.

Hey Kayak folks, Please don't ASSUME flexible dates while searching and displaying results!

Version 22.0.2 2
 (Terribly annoying) The "current location" feature does not pick up Charlotte, NC. As another reviewer mentioned regarding Dallas, this is a major hub. The search feature for airport destinations also doesn't work. I typed in my destination and the wheel kept spinning but didn't pull up anything. Seems the location feature is terrible overall. 

The app worked for me in the past, and it was great. But I think they have a bug now.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Mr) Great tool

Version 22.0.2 5
 (yee) yee

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Watch out for Non-Refundable hotels) Beware! I made a non-refundable hotel reservation without realizing it using this app! Kayak customer service says that because you get an email confirmation telling you about the non-refundable hotel room after you book it, then you should know - but that is only after the fact! I didn't realize the room was non-refundable using the app. I will never use the app again!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesum) Gr8 app makes ur tarvel search vry easy

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great!) Great airfare finder and app!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Love it.) Beats all the others

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Hotels: Good Map, Need More Reviews) In app map is easy to use, but overall other apps have more reviews for hotels

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Best air fare search) I have just started using and was looking for a flight. I checked for the same flight on Orbitz and this app located my flight for $100 less

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great) Everything in one site.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great for busy traveler) Great to check flight stats, departure times, etc. the mobile app returns higher prices than the actual online app, though. This has happened a few times within an hour of checking each. The prices could have changed in they time, but it's been pretty consistent.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Kayak free) Awesome app. Very user friendly and convenient. All it needs is to do is make an option to select room only or all inclusive when I reference to hotel selection. Still a very nice app.

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Okay) Needs reset on change price update

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Constantly crashes, listed airfare often not available) Horrible App. Crashes everytime you click on a hotel listing and try to do something like look at photos.  50/50 chance that Kayak's airfare is correct - half the time when you find a fare and click to book, the Kayak listed fare is no longer available.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (One of the best apps) The only thing I don't like is inability to select non-stop flights or hotel ratings BEFORE the search. Because of that search takes longer. It would be nice to have an option to "filter" before the search.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Love it!!!) So convenient.

Version 22.0.2 5

 (Amazing) I booked a flight to london with this app and got hotels in Germany, Spain , Paris. This app is amazing

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Kayak is great :)) This is an awesome app :)

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Nice design and search options) Worked quickly and easily as I would hope. I especially liked the ability to easily reference each airlines baggage fee policies which made the cheapest flight not the best choice in my situation. I'm just glad I'm not the guy that is banned from Kayak for life.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Love this app!) Kayak is already a great site, this app makes it so simple to find what you need.

 (Just amazing!) This is a wonderfully created and presented app!  It really can help your dream destinations become a reality as most of these properties are more than fairly priced , completely unique!!  I could keep going,  I can spend hours on here!  I cam to look at things available in Turks and Caicos and I'm already somewhere in the south pacific!  Be careful travel junkies this ones for you. Phenomenal!

 (Great app) Easy to use, love it

Version 19.0.3 1
 (Wrong prices) Overall the app looks nice and searching is easy but every time I select a flight, the prices and sometimes the hours shown by kayak end up being very different than the real ones. That completely defeats the purpose of the app.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (VERY good!!) Love it a lot!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesome) This app is packed with features. You can email them your itinerary and they will organize it and keep a copy of email so u can easily see it. U can also track flights, convert currencies etc. awesome app.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (It works better than the rest but it needs.... More info or pictures) It needs a selection to select the number of beds wanted

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Convenient and awesome) The best!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (So easy to use!) So easy and quick. Simple and the cheapest flights!

Version 22.0.2 2
 (Problems since last version on iPhone.) Used to be a great tool, however on this version searching for anything seems to be broken. I can't even get it to send feedback. I have deleted the app and reinstalled numerous times. Hope it's temporary.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great internationally too) I have used Kayak mobile in US and internationally and it is the best. I am currently in Chengdu, Sichuan (China) and I'm planning a 50 mile bicycle ride and kayak has nice hotel rooms available at my destination for $41. Cheaper than the local travel agency. 

And don't worry about comparing this app to their crappy website. It is a single site app and doesn't have any of those annoying pop-up sites. It's one of the best apps for booking hotel to hostel rooms, especially late minute reservations.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Kayak) Great app

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Great tool) Easy..and fast to book hotel flights and cars.. Used the app to book both my Canada trip and Puerto Rico trip this year.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Favorite flight booking app!) It's so easy to use!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Use all the time for my travels.

Version 22.0.2 2
 (Lockup) The alp quits after searching a multi stop flight itinerary. Must be un installed to and reinstalled to work again.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Easy travel planning in a pinch) Intuitive, easy to use, and high-functioning app that makes searching for the best travel deal something you can do while waiting in line for coffee. Love it.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Really easy to use and very helpful) This is a great app with an extremely user friendly interface. 5 stars.

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Issues) I had a lot of issues pulling up prices on hotels. Everytime I tried to check a price on a hotel it says error pulling up prices. Very frustrating considering that what the app is for. Definately needs improvement!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Most enjoyable app experience) Just an incredible app. Surly my  Most enjoyable app experience. 

Thank you guys so much.

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Buy) I love this it soo good!!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (So far very good) Just used 3 different flight apps and this one had the lowest fares :)

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Great app) What a great app. Easy to use, and finds the best prices for air, car and hotel. Makes booking easy. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five starts is that the app does not allow for saving various airfare/car rental/hotel combos to price out alternative itineraries. I need to type the info into a spreadsheet for each option (i.e., do we trade off the cost of a lower connecting flight with a nicer hotel or should we visit one city or another based on travel prices, etc. --- Kayak: food for thought for a future release?)

In any event, the app is wonderful and we plan on putting it to good use!

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Love it) Love!

Version 22.0.2 4
 (THE travel app) Kayak is our 'go to' app for travel planning.  Been using Kayak since the beginning, even preceding when it became known as Kayak.  Meta search travel is the only way to search.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Good app) Really good app

Version 22.0.2 1
 (False Advertising!!!!) I tried booking a flight for a certain price when I clicked it redirected me and the price was almost double what kayak was offering. That is awful!!! If you can't offer it at that price then don't advertise it for that price!!!! That's false advertising!!! I tried calling customer service and you can't get ahold of anyone unless you have their extension!!! Talk about a bad company!! False advertising and can't talk to anyone??? How do they stay in business???

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Nice) Very informative

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesomely easy to use!) Love this app. So easy to use!  Thanks.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Simply well-built) This is an app where you can tell time and dedication was put into it. Works very well with the iPhone 4.

Kayak itself has good service and amazing low prices on airfares. You can't go wrong with it! Can't really say much about hotel hunting though, so I will leave that for other app-users of Kayak to rate and review on that.

Version 22.0.2 5

 (Excellent) Too good

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great app!) I like this app better than any other travel app. You can always find the cheapest price here, cuz kayak doesn't sell ticket istself, but provide the comparison between other travel websites. And there is a very cool function there, u can choose your departure city by simply tapping on the map, to see the cheapest price to any country on the world. I really like to play with this!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Best deals I can find

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great App!) Easy to use. Faster than searching the net!

 (L) Great

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Great interface but doesn't work) Doesn't recognize my location (San Francisco) automatically or when manually entered.  Reinstalled and still doesn't work.  No reply from support either.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Kayak) Amazing how u can obtain the same results on my iPod. I couldn't ask for anything more. I'm loving it.

Version 22.0.2 5

 (It's ok) It's ok

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Nice App) Works great

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Fares are wrong) The price for flights shown on the app is different from the website it takes you to. I was happy to see a price in the range I was looking for but kayak took me to jetblue's website and the price for that same flight was $80 more. Very upsetting!!!

Version 22.0.2 4

 (Great) Kayak has been the best in its class for 5 years by now. Why use anything else ?

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Misleading Prices!!!) Looking fir tickets to Europe, this app has shown me many times already cheap prices that, when I want to book the tickets, DO NOT MATCH the prices shown by the airline.  The diference on the prices was major!!!  Plus, it is almost impossible to contact anyone when a problem like this comes up.

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Good job kayak) Very handy and useful app.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (So neat !!!) I love this app it is so helpful in so many ways. I still do not think I have found all the helpful things within this app not for lack of organization, but there is just so many neat things about this app. My favorite part is the "buzz" part, because my husband and I don't have exact dates for our trips we just put the info in and swipe for the best timing deal. I love the app. Great job to whomever it may concern.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (A must have app!!!) This is a must have app if you travel a lot...it's easy to use and all your flights are just a click away.

 (Good app) Easy to navigate, like filter options

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Works well) It has worked well for me!

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Beware costly glitches) I was searching round-trip flights and pushed the back button to change the return date. This app had a glitch where even though the search showed the new date, the flight details showed the previous date. I didn't notice this and booked my flight for the wrong dates, just assuming that everything was right. My mistake for not checking thoroughly, but it was the app that caused this. Ended up having to pay $325 to change my flights!!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Works as advertised.) See above

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Kayak) This app is very good I use it for all my flights n hotels

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great application) Very helpfull and quick app.

 (Good) Showed what I needed and easy to use

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great App!!!!) Great App!!!!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Kayak rules) I was looking for a cheap hotel in Denver at short notice and decided to use this app to book. Not only is it streamlined and user friendly, but it's extra features (packing lists for example) go above and beyond the call of a travel app. Upon arriving at my hotel, the ladies helping me check in had lost the faxed booking information. Luckily Kaya has exceptional customer service. I spoke with Jessica, who was friendly, articulate, and quick to solve problems. She faxed the info again while remaining on the line with me to make sure they got it, and all was well. I would highly recommend this app.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (The best app!!) I use it all the time to book my flights!!!

Version 22.0.2 1

 (Love the easy format!!!) Some websites are hard to navigate. Not this one.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great Website, Great App) I love Kayak, and its app is just as great! Very intuitive and touch-screen friendly interface. Sometimes when passing over to the airlines' sites, your search can be lost. But I blame the incompetent airlines ;) This app makes the nightmare of navigating complex airfare scheduling a snap. Highly recommended!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Use) Very good apps.

Version 22.0.1 5

Not to mention, I've found some sweet deals on 1-way flights for our multi-city wedding/honeymoon trip this summer. 5 stars easy! I even prefer the app to the kayak website. Well done, Kayak development team!

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Nothing special & needs work) App needs to integrate with the website more fully. App does not often contain updates or changes.  I find that it is easier to access website through browser and keep the link on my page than use the app. Still has away to go.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesomely Helpful) Awesomely Helpful

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Simply great app) That's the way travel search should always be.

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Needs more features & still crashes) I like this app but it still frequently crashes.  Also need to add the ability to search +/- 3 days like the web version and other sites allow you to do.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Avid traveler) Designers really thinking!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Love this App) I love to travel and this app has been my faithful companion. It's a breeze search for and booking flights. Great job with the recent design tweaks they've made!

Version 22.0.2 2
 (Prices not right) Easy to use, but when you go to
 book the prices don't match up with 
application. They are higher! Kayak gave me 
A $282 dollar flight, but when tried to book 
It was over $500....?

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (World travel) I have so many places to visit with my future wife. Kayak is really helpful to find the cheapest tickets even though she makes it worth every penny.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great app) I'm a kayakaholic

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Jams up your phone) This huge application jams up my 16GB 3GS.  It is so large that the update won't install unless directly connected to my computer but it still tries to update and causes no end of problems on the phone.  It sometimes locks the phone from making calls, interferes with other applications and when you attempt to actually run it, it does absolutely NOTHING!.  You can't even delete the miserable thing.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Kayak's app is simple & swift!) This is a pretty great travel app that I think will work well for most travelers. I'm used to using Kayak's website but the app is now my preferred method. Be excellent to each other! *guitar riff*

 (Love it) I so love this app. It's the best ever.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Better Than a Travel Agent) I generally don't review apps but it asked me to so I will. This app is great! My travel adviser actually called me and said she was sorry but the Kayak vacation I planned was better than what she could do. Highly recommend for travelers. Only 4 stars because you can't package a trip together like Trip Adviser. Other than that it's flawless.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great app) Great app

Version 22.0.2 4
 (I miss the FF program filter) Nice app. I assume because of space certain filters aren't available. Only +/- 2 days filter (not 3), and no filter for FF programs... My favorite feature on the Kayak site. Other than that, app works great!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Amazing app) It feels like the future

 (What happened?) This used to be the best travel app, simple, easy, fast. I used it everyday! Loved the history features and the fast airfares. Could've used a better 'alternate airport' function, but I'm not picking. 

BUT with the latest version, it doesn't even launch on my iPhone4 running 5.0. 5 stars to 1. Help Kayak folks, get a fix NOW!!

Version 22.0.2 5

 (Excelente!) Muito bom

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Accuracy? No!) If you use this app to book flight tickets, forget it. I was using this app to book my tickets to china. It gives out the same price every time I search, and tell me the price is not available anymore every time it double check. It really gets me annoyed.

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Does it help to book an affordable trip?) Everybody is saying how cool the ap is and how easy it is to use, but does it actually find affordable trips? Are prices accurate?

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Kayak) Great

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Pleasantly surprised) I didn't really expect this much functionality. It even has a basic itinerary feature.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Very handy) Needs to improve the layout a bit but when it comes to booking on the go .... The kayak app is the best way to do it

Version 22.0.2 5
 (This app is the best.) I wish I knew about the last time I took a trip. I would have used it to book. I know what I'll use for my next trip....kayak!

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Excellent app...with a couple of shortcomins) I use this app extensively. However, it seems buggy when editing trips. It won't let me change flight times or other items. Also, would be helpful to add itineraries not necessarily purchased on the app.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Love kayak) I have frequented this app, very useful and accurate. It has proved to be informative and helpful when making decisions when booking our hotels.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Easiest-to-use travel app) This impressive app is even easier to use than their full website. Searching for flights is simple, even for special instances of one-way or multi-stop. You can use the app to set flight tracker notifications which make hunting for the best deal a snap. 
In addition to the excellent user interface, this app also provides information on baggage fees for each airline, contact info for airlines, maps for each airport, and a packing list.

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Info not always accurate) Some discrepancies between the site and the app.

Version 22.0.2 3
 (‚úà) Is don't show how much is the total for my dates

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Works like magic!) Gives all the filters I need to find the best price!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (UpInTheAir) I fly 100+ times per year, I rent cars every other day and sleep in hotels more than my own home.  I use Kayak to make it all happen.  Just download it.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (I like it) Pretty Good!

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Engg) Good usability

Version 22.0.2 1
 (changed currency midway in the booking process) The app failed to convert the currency for a listed flight/train and kept the same amount or number. So midway in the booking process. 89USD became 89 Bristish Pounds. Very misleading. Attempts were made to contact Kayak but were unsuccessful.

Version 22.0.2 5

 (Great app. Good deals & great hotels!) Awesome

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Good but...) I have this app on my iPhone and iPad. It's great and super helpful. The problem and what I think is missing is that on the iPad, you can't set up price alerts/notifications. That would make it better.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (KAYAK) Very Good App!!!!!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Great app) This app is great for searching, booking and tracking flights. I love the way it shows where the air plane is every moment in tracking mode.

 (Kayak) The best app ever for travel

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (All In One App, Practical) Checked the prices of hotel rooms on Expedia and this app has competitive prices as relative to that site. Additionally the plane tickets prices are the best around. This app allows for a one stop shop for travel and lodging in any country or city around the world.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Easy app) Great app to use. It remembers what I was searching for and the selection process to find what I need is easy. User friendly fast.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Love it!!!) This app is very easy to use. Will definitely use in the future.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (great rates - tonight rates are amazing) the last update now gives me rates for today.  I was in Boston and had not gotten a room for the night, the rates were amazing and had many hotels.  Would like to see these rates more easily, but so far the best trvel app i have seen.  I pretty much only use KAYAK now the other apps are a waste of space since i see Kayak rates and other sites as well.  The KAYAK rate seems to be best.  Keep the updates coming for sorting and things.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Best Update but multicity needs work) Great App and latest features are great. Sill loses ability to search for multicity efficient options

Version 22.0.1 4
 (Well thought out app.) Well thought out app.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Excellent Travel App) Excellent app for finding flights.

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Good one but) It is good and handy
But hotel and car rental rate abit more than others

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Good app, but needs some work) Good app, but it'd be helpful to have a way to plan all trips and look at them if not yet booked tickets/accommodations.

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Good app but ..,) The app works great but I can't figure out how to delete my flight search history.

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Excellent travel tool) I love using the application and he website to track flight and hotel prices. Simple and easy to use. Highly recommended!

Version 22.0.2 2
 (Not consistent results) My iPhone app returns better and more results than my iPad app. Doing the same search several times on the iPhone causes app to lock up.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Booking was easy and quick and got the best possible price

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Hawaii?) Seems like on this app Hawaii doesn't exist so I have to use the website, which is fine but it would be more convenient to use the app. I wonder why I can't search for this state!!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Easy to navigate and super fast) One of best air fare apps. Kayak has made it super easy to browse fares.

Version 22.0.2 5

 (Very handy :-)) Nice & easy to use, & lots of useful information. Great :-)

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Excellent) I should have used a better app, but I really can't remember when. Kayak is the most useful,friendly,fast and fun app I've ever used. I highly recommended it.

Version 22.0.2 5

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Great stuff

Version 22.0.2 3
 (Good but crashes) Loved old app.  New one looks great, easy to use, but crashes

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great!) Kayak has nailed it!

Version 22.0.2 2
 (ANNOYING) Keeps crashing... And have to start search over...really ANNOYING !

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Best Travel app ever) This The best Travel app for the experienced and inexperienced traveler. So easy to use. Quick results! Just excellent!

Version 22.0.1 2
 (Owner Agent) Not accurate enough and no option for least expensive travel time.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (So Easy to Use!!! Love it) Such an easy way to find flights, hotels, and cars. It's the best of all of the travel sites packed in one!!!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Love it!) Love it for looking up flights!  Very easy to use and the filters work great to weed through all the flights to find specific times frames.

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Perfecto en todo) No hay nada mas q buscar

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Very user friendly) I really like how I can see $'s without forking over a card!!

Version 22.0.2 2
 (Latest update keeps crashing!) I love this app and use it all the time, but, this latest update keeps crashing and renders the app unusable. iPad 3, IOS 5.1.1
Please fix it soon as this frequent traveler needs Kayak!

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Never leave home without it) Allows me to stay on top of my travel details at all times on my trip.

Version 22.0.2 1
 (Yeccch) The old Kayak HD app was a fast and useful godsend. This new version is just as sloppy and slow as any other airline website. 

Oh well. No more bookings via the app from me...  Sayonara Kayak... Seems you pooped in your own punchbowl.  But why?  The Fonz join your design team after some shark jumping?

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Well organized

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Awesome) Awesome App!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (awesome information) The best Flight Search App for iPhone.
easy to use and very speedy.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great App) I love this app! I was able to use it several times, but the important time was when I was planning a girls weekend out. All hotels was trying to over charge because of the holiday but using this app I was able to get a great price!

Version 22.0.2 5
 (Easy) A++++++++++++

Version 22.0.2 1
 (What happened?) This app used to work fine but now it just crashes without ever even opening.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Traveler) Best ever.  Better than using a desktop.

Version 22.0.1 4
 (Quick effective) This app is quick and efficient, save time and money on travel plans by using this

Version 22.0.2 4
 (Fast app, accurate results.) The only wish-list item for me would be 
to be able to crawl through all US airlines
(JetBlue, Southwest...)

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Love this site!) Use for air & hotels. The grid is great.

Version 22.0.1 1
 (Simply doesn't work) Seeing the features, I used it for a trip in parallel to using TripIt. Kayak is useless, literally. It got all my trip segments, so much so that it sends me reminders by email. If I access the website, my trip is all there. But in the app, I am told I have no trip! That is, when it allowed me in with my password because most of the
time, my seconds-ago changed password is rejected. Furthermore, the feature tracking "on time" flights informed me of a flight on time. Expedia and TripIt sent me emails that that particular flight was cancelled. Nothing from Kayak. Why pile up features when the simplest and most essential ones like "password access" and "my trips" are just not working? TripIt is the way to go!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great app!) Love the look..easy to use and has come in very handy!!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great!) I love this works great!

Version 22.0.1 5

 (How did mankind survive before Kayak?) Well, that may be a bit much but kayak and an iphone make travel so much easier.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Very convenient) Easy to use!  Great to help fantasiZe about ur next trip.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Useful) This app helps me alot

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great service) Great service, unbeatable prices
ALL the info we need to have in one place! Thank you

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great site, only wish) That it would include packaged vacation deals or deals for places that you plan on visiting.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Kayak) Kayak is, by far, the best travel app!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Perfect!) Love that prices are FINAL, taxes included etc.
A real timesaver

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Kayak) Great

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Ms Ana) Best app ever. Basicly does all an agency would offer to you in one click

Version 22.0.1 5
 (App) Great app... Very helpful and user friendly!

Version 22.0.1 1
 (Not useful for me) As soon as I started using this app I felt that it wanted to sell me stuff more than help me plan my trip. I did check a couple of flights and found that the prices were not exactly competitive--my local travel agent was able to offer tickets that were approx. USD 120 cheaper. I'm now using the TripIt app instead to plan my trip and am happy with it so far.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great app) This is a must to have app..

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Awesome) I love this app.

Version 22.0.1 4
 (Great app) Great app. Would be even better if I could have the option to check for direct flights on one way and non direct on the way back.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Thank you) Thank you!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Why did it take me so long to download this app!? Amazing!!) This is an amazing app! I wish I downloaded it earlier!

Version 22.0.1 4
 (Details) Love the details. Used it to book my vacation to the keys. Very informative.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Multi-city) Great for multiple bookings. We wanted to stay a few days in each stop. Kayak is also very good for picking up a car in one city and dropping off in another.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great easy-to-use app!) This is a great way to keep all my business and personal trips organized in one place. It's very user-friendly. I love it!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (App for an apple made for each other) If you believe that not leaving the apartment is the perfect vacation, then this app is not for you. But if you desire to travel past you zip code, then this a must have next to fresh underwear and air. So get your travel check list ready and get out there. There is only so mug time you have to live, might as well get in debt over a plane ticket and hotel rather then the usual stuff. It's hard times, so do what I do, go to a beach you can't pronounce, have a drink you cant pronounce and have a personal tlc day/week/month. You deserve it.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great App!) Love this app! It is so easy to use!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Best) It is a needed app for a traveller, very nice app, updated data all the time.

Version 22.0.1 4
 (Easy to use) Very good app, I use it often.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great app. Easy to use.) Love this app

Version 22.0.1 4
 (Great) Love Kayak and its options are the reason I use their website over others, but the app could use some tweaking such as adding arrival date for long time zone crossing international flights. I agree about the flex date options, would like to see more of that on here too. Otherwise...quick and easy to navigate!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Maybe my most used App) Great app and website. I live by it when traveling.  Don't leave home without it.

Version 22.0.1 3
 (Missing Some Web Features) Good for quick glance at airline rates, but does not allow same level of detail as Website (e.g. Flex date grid)

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Time Saver) Time Saver!!!!

Version 22.0.1 4
 (Barenis) I really have enjoyed it. 
Very easy to open the app and select destination within min without having to use a computer, which may take a bit longer. 
Very pleased.

Version 22.0.1 5

Version 22.0.1 1
 (Lost my reservation!!!) Absolutely pathetic. I booked a hotel room for my husband in San Francisco, paid for it al on Kayak. He went to check in yesterday and NO RESERVATION!!! The hotel calls Kayak and the kayak operator claims to have faxed the reservation info to the hotel, even though the hotel does not take reservations by fax. You'd think kayak would know how to make reservations with their vendors. Also, even though my credit card had been billed the payment issue was not resolved at checkin and Needless to say my husband didn't get into his room till past midnight.

 (Jess's Kayak POV) My first time using this website was to book a flight to Tokyo, Japan. Now that I finally upgraded to the iPhone, (it was ab time!) I have reaffirmed how much I am absolutely IN LOVE with Kayak as my no. 1 go to travel agent!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Still the very, very best single travel tool) Kayak has been recommended by experts because of its ability to check all the major consolidators as well as airline, hotel and car rental companies sites. I have relied on it for years. Having said that, the iPhone app is still a pleasant surprise. It's amazingly fast, flexible and easy to use.

Version 22.0.1 5

 (This is how all apps should be) Easy to use seamless interface. Just booked a flight and car with this app.  

Only criticism I have is that when it takes you to an outside website within the app, you can't turn the screen. Maybe that is not possible though. 

Overall, totally love this app and highly recommend.

 (State of the art app) Absolutely incredible app! It's fast, it's thorough, I find it easier to use than the website (sorry Kayakers!).

Version 22.0.1 4
 (Awesome !) Great app! The kayak.com website has an option to include the checkin baggage in calculating the fare. That's really a very useful and convenient feature which saves the effort of going to a particular airline's website to check the baggage fee. It would be great if the app also includes this feature.

Version 22.0.1 5

 (Time Saving App) I absolutely appreciate this app. It saves me time by using the daily flight tracker (reviews my flight selection daily and alerts when there is a lower priced flight), and the auto fill is a time saver from tedious tasks.

 (Very User Friendly) Using app on iPhone 3GS and it does an excellent job of allowing you to drill down to the tiniest detail and then you can e-mail results to yourself or someone else. I love being able to compare prices with other major travel sites.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Revolutionary!) Not only is this app ahead of other travel apps, it blows their websites out of the water too!
This app takes the work out of looking for fare deals. You can broaden your search from a month, all the way down to the hour, while still comparing the best fares. It also features other travel necessities like a hotel and car finder, which makes it a one stop shop. This app is awesome, plus it's free! So download it and stop reading reviews!

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Good!) Like it!

Version 22.0.1 4

Version 22.0.1 4
 (Love the app, search results frustrating) This app is way easier than a few of the others.  It sorts well and remembers your last search so you can keep looking quickly.

The frustration is when you click in a flight to reserve it, so often the website it takes you to has already increased fares.

Version 22.0.1 5
 (Great Flight Tracker) This is a well written app. I only use the flight tracker but that works great and even shows the live map of where the plane is in the sky. Pretty sick.

Version 22.0.1 2

Version 22.0.1 1
 (Do people like to pay more?) The best price for a hotel out of 5 was $286. I went to Priceline and named my own price for that same hotel and got it for $150. Worthless app, they only search their own companies!

When it is fixed, I will rate this app higher.

Version 21.0.4 4
 (User friendly) I like the simplicity of the app & how you can search & modify your search faster than in the desktop version. However, I miss having the option to see charts & recent deals you get in the desktop  version.

Version 22.0.1 2
 (I've had better) This app would be more effective if the flight tracker showed accurate gates and updated when they change.

Version 22.0.1 5

Version 22.0.1 1
 (Hate it!) They're forcing people to use this app because they are retiring Kayak HD.  HD is far, far superior in info on the iPad and this Mobile version doesn't even come close.  Not even the PRO version I bought can touch the HD in terms of content.  Bah!

Version 22.0.1 5

 (Great app) This app is so user friendly. I am a sucker for detail, so I noticed that the keyboard on either my iPhone or my iPad will automatically convert to whatever is relevant to the field I am typing in, on this app. A lot of apps don't do that and it's very frustrating...for me anyways. 5 stars for sure, although I had one crash when I was submitting my auto fill information, and that happened first time I used it. Didn't do it again do far. I highly recommend solely based on it's user friendliness. Thanks kayak.

 (Kayak App) Great app, easy to use, great design and functionality, and of course great prices

Version 21.0.4 2
 (Not a fan) Some parts of this app were good but ultimately I'd rather use the regular kayak online. The features such as search functionality and saving searches is just easier and better. I love the regular online kayak, this app not so much.

Version 22.0.0 5
 (Love this App) This is the best and most user friendly app ever!!

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Excellent! So amazing on the iPad!) I have used the Kayak app for iPhone and Droid devices for years now and I loved it, but the iPad one is truly awesome. It has all of the functionality of the smaller app, with these gorgeous photographs and details built into it about the hotels. I am really enjoying planning my next trip with it. Thanks Kayak!

 (Top notch) Their website is decent but this app is top notch, no doubt about it. Great interface, simple to use, fast, and easily share results. So far so good kayak.

Version 22.0.0 1
 (If I could rate Zero I would) Where do I start? Either you can't really book the flight (you are taken to some site with no booking option or you randomly cant get into Delta) or the real price is + 300 dollars. Or the app is down for hours at a time. Take your pick.

Version 21.0.4 5

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great!) Nuff said :)

Version 22.0.0 5
 (Great!  Easy too!) That is all...

Version 22.0.0 5

Version 21.0.4 4
 (Must-Have App) KAYAK is my go-to app to research and double-check airfare and available hotels. Easy to use, its intuitive features are clean & efficient. Whether you are a business and/or leisure traveler, download this app now!

Version 22.0.0 5
 (Best in class) Very good tool. Benchmark for others.

 (Kayak app) No problems at all

Version 22.0.0 1

Thanks but no thanks.

Version 22.0.0 5
 (Excellent ease of use) Great

Version 22.0.0 5
 (Great App!) Awesome app! Exactly what I was looking for.

Version 22.0.0 5
 (Nice app) Convenient

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Best way to find airfare) Great site

Version 22.0.0 5
 (Awesome!) The most difficult thing I've used is the car rental section.  Emailing myself a reminder was all the way at the bottom of the web page.  I finally found it, but it was just easier in the flight section where everything was incredibly well laid out.  Really, I haven't seen anything to complain about.

A nice feature would be to compare selections instead of using emails for later comparison use.  That list could be compiled in-app and then emailed or saved somehow.  Also being able to search further away from the airports or near a specific address would be nice for car rentals.

Thank you for creating a great one-stop shop!

 (New App Outstanding!!) Massive improvements in speed, functionality and UI - go to app for flights!

Version 21.0.4 5
 (First stop when planning a trip) Simply the best interface and tool for finding the perfect flight available on mainline carriers. Quicker and with more sort and filter options than any other resource. Any business traveler that doesn't use this is wasting his/her time any probably money too.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Awesome) Easy to use

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great) Always easy!!

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great job by Kayak) Thanks to Kayak for not tweaking their old dotCom style look-n-feel to give us an iPad app, but creating a true tablet style app, whic h exploits the apple GUI standards to hilt. I no longer use any other travel site for travel related searches.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great app. Simple design and functioning!) This is a really practical and simple to use app.

Version 21.0.4 3
 (Good but...) I really do like this app, but, the airport search is terrible as compared to any other travel site or app! You should be able to type in a city or state and get a list of airports. But no. If you don't know the exact name of the airport, you have to google it. Unless of course you're going to a city that has an airport with that city's name in it. Ex. Miami international. Type in Virginia or Aruba and you get a blank. You'll have to google Aruba airports and then come back to the app and plug in the airport code of the airport closest to your destination. The only reason it didn't get more stars was this one problem!

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Very handy app) The features are very accessible, and it seems to work just as well as the website, maybe better.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great app on the go) Useful free app.  Quicker than the web based if mobile.

Version 21.0.4 4
 (Buen√≠simo!) Es f√°cil de usar. Me encantar√≠a que tuviera un rengl√≥n para contabilizar el dinero que uno lleva y usa para la estad√≠a. Es genial. Lo recomiendo.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Fastest flight checker on the planet) This is simply the fastest way to find all available flights between where you are at and where you want to go. All flights. All fares. All seats. This is the app you want when you get stuck at the airport.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Good) Very complete and useful.

Version 21.0.4 4
 (Crashes sometimes) Good. When searching for flights and other features . Crashes when search on iPhone while you search second time and change route

Version 21.0.4 4
 (A great find) Saves lots of time!

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Best travel app) I travel several times a month. I use this app daily to check flight prices and hotel deals. The only thing I wish it had was bing's when to buy tool integrated. This tool is easy to use and buy with!

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great aplication) Works well and helps a lot

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Works Well) No problems!

Version 21.0.4 4
 (Promising) Never have really trusted these "all-inclusive" sites that search in all airlines for me, but so far Kayak seems promising. Will be able to give 5 stars when I actually book a trip, so for now this is it :-). Will continue using and maybe will soon provide a better review.

Version 21.0.4 5

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Kayak App) Really nice application for my New iPad.....work perfectly!!!

Version 21.0.4 4
 (Great App!) Easier than their website to use with great features like flight status and airline contact info a tap away - lacks some of the filters the website does unfortunately such as Leg Length.

Version 21.0.4 4
 (One of the best travel Aps) One of the best travel apps at a great price!  One of my only complaints are that it has no way of keeping track of your expenses on your trip. Additionally it would be great if you could download "My Trips" information to your device such as your booking receipts. This would be particularly useful on international trips where you don't always haven internet connection.

Version 21.0.4 5

 (Latest version) Very helpful. Clean and crisp response.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Wonderful.) I have never been compelled to write an app review before but as this app is close to perfect, I felt I should!  The ability to search airfare for a variety of itineraries is unmatched. I am planning a trip and looking for the lowest fare in and out of several potential cities and I really feel that the comprehensive flight search and intuitive layout of the search results made it possible for me to save several hundred dollars. At a glance I could see carrier, departure times, duration of flight and number of stops (and of course, price!). Fare alerts let me watch the trends and the airport guides helped me to decide if that 13 hour layover was worth it. 

Overall an easy to use and helpful app.

Version 21.0.4 1
 (Too many outdated prices) App doesn't help much for finding accurate prices on flights. When clicking through to book flights, I often find they are no longer available. A list of alternate fares is shown, then when trying to book any of those, it turns out they are no longer available either (so why were they shown as alternatives?). Another one of my favorites is when I try to book a flight only to be told that the "fare" is no longer available, and the available fare is hundreds of dollars more than what was shown in the search results.

Version 21.0.4 5

Version 21.0.4 4
 (Kayak for the iPhone is missing a few features...) We travel extensively for work and play and use Kayak on the computer for most of the research. I was stoked to get an iPhone because I felt that the Kayak app would be helpful. Many of the features I love on the web version are missing which makes the experience less enjoyable. Specifically the filter by amenities option. We have a dog who travels with us and being able to know if a place took dogs would be helpful.  Overall, the Kayak app is helpful but I still need the Internet to do many of our bookings.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great Application) Love this app

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great App) Does what it should no complaints!

Version 21.0.4 2
 (Two HUGE Issues) 1. No way to save a flight in a list to keep an eye on the price. 
2. Search history doesn't save a filters. Every time I run the search, I have to reset the time/length filter. There's not even an option for a default filter that I could apply to every search. 
The combination of those two things means that every time I want to recheck prices, I have to go through the full setup. 
It's also annoying that you can filter only after the search is complete--wastes a lot of time searching for flights you're just going to filter out. 
Too bad Yapta's app doesn't work at all. that would solve my problems.

Version 21.0.4 5

Version 21.0.4 4
 (Addithisnicknameisalreadytaken) Great app never crashes , user friendly fast and has a lot of other options
Didn't like that there is no option of hotel and flight or hotel flight and car combined. It's just give u one item at the time. Also doesn't help u spell check the airport name like other sites
And lastly I would love if I can only type the city or country and it would give me all the options of the airports in that region, but here I have to know the name of the airport and that's limiting.
Other than that its really fast and never crashes, also great features like currency exchange and packing "don't forget"list.

Version 21.0.4 4
 (Very useful) This is a good app.

Version 21.0.3 2
 (Flight prices higher in app!) I kept the app for over a year and check it to see if it's fixed. When I find a flight on the app the price is higher than if I do the exact same search on the kayak website. I do not understand why this is the case. The same settings and I ensure the depart same airport is selected in the website. 

This makes the app useless.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great app.) Works great.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Kayak Saves Time!) Great app-can be in bed and check out flights and hotels!

Version 21.0.4 5

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Love this app!) So many helpful tools rolled into one!

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Time saver) Seems to work just as well as the website at saving you from having to search every airline individually. Runs pretty smoothly!

Version 21.0.4 4

 (Favorite travel app!!!) Love It! Very easy to use!

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Accurate and easy) The app combines many features in a way that makes them easy to use, and does a fine job of accurately incorporating data from emails you forward to it from airlines, hotels, car rentals, and the like confirming reservations made outside the app. Highly recommended - both the iPad and the iPhone versions.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Great) Love it

Version 21.0.4 5
 (I love it.) I love the fact that you can track the price of your flight.

Version 21.0.4 5
 (Excellent when fully utilized) At first i wasn't impressed because my price alerts didn't seem to be updating.  The next day, though, they were.

 (Kayak) I have looked through it the prices are not competitive in fact there are the highest . I figured the hole reason is to get your Ipeople the best prices possible I think  maybe u guys can negotiate some type of deals with these airline since u are giving them business only when it comes from any apple products or when they log on to kayak .

 (Ultimate airfare search) This is the way shopping for airfare should have always been.

Found a better deal on southwest ($230) by removing the middleman.  I guess the website is useful by removing my buyers remorse.

Version 21.0.2 4

Version 21.0.2 5

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Easy as pie) Great interface - very easy to use.

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Pretty useful) Got this app 4 months ago. Works pretty well. Easy-to-use interface, lots of customization. It would be nice if the available flights gave an on-time comparison like Expedia, but that's a minor thing.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (A Go-To Travel App) When planning a trip or when making changes along the way, I always check Kayak. Results are quick and straight forward.

Version 21.0.2 3
 (Bug report) Flight tracker stopped working after the last update. Shows up only for the first flight in any itinerary - disappears if you scroll down then up. Alerts don't seem to be working any more either.
This app has become more about selling travel and less about helping you track your trip in one place.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Kayak is the best) This site is simply the best fro flight and hotel search...not only it has the best proces but also is so fast and user friendly. Thumbs Up for Kayak.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Only Flight App You Need) Nuff said

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Play It Forward) Was a heavy user of Expedia.com, until I shared w friend in California that I was searching for best airfare, to fly his way.  He asked me if I'd searched Kayak yet, and having literally surfed the web dating back to '89, (pre-graphics/text only days), I arrogantly said what's Kayak, thinking it would be a joke of a travel resource.  Interestingly, I've booked virtually every airline ticket since that trip in '04 on Kayak.  It is a must for both seasoned and non-seasoned traveler's, year-round... Love it!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app for travel!) Is great for finding and keeping track of your travel details.

Version 21.0.2 2
 (Non-functional on iPad?) ?

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Love) So fast, easy and helpful! Looking for a flight just got great for me. I would recommend this app to frequent travelers any day!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (OUTSTANDING APP!!!!!!!!!!!!) This App is, NO DOUBT, one of my most used App's out of the many I have downloaded on my iphone!!!  I also want to make very CLEAR that this "Flight" App is an EXCELLENT App along with very EFFICIENT, USER FRIENDLY, OFFERS UNREAL DEALS, SYSTEMICALLY ORGANIZED, OFFERS  AWESOME SUPPORT, just in case, there is a very slim chance, a Customer is experiencing Difficulties of some sort, the FILTERS that are provided, WOW, make your "Flight" search even more simplistic & much quicker, the capability of being able to "SORT" such as, SORT by(Flights): Stops, Price, Time 
Etc. and my most FAVORITE Feature is the ALERT system, for example; I'm looking for a "FLIGHT" from Michigan to Los Angeles, CA on the following the Dates:  departing on April 21st & returning on April 28th...1 Traveler...Time?  Makes NO difference to me or for the party who is picking me up in Los Angeles, so, I just leave blank or as is, I think(???), a couple more tiny steps and I ALWAYS sort by PRICE, then I set ALERTS, meaning I choose any & all Airports from around my area of which I would NOT mind departing out from on April 21st, then I place in the airport I'm Flying into(Los Angeles, CA and I repeat this process for each Airport I would NOT mind departing from and from then on, it's very easy instructions of how-to-do to ACTIVATE your ALERTS!!!  Activating your ALERTS, basically, means whatever you set your individual preferences at, such as, AIRPORTS; TIMES(if any); PRICES; STOPS(if any); etc., etc., etc., whenever, let's say, there was a PRICE REDUCTION(happens daily, TRUST ME), you will, immediately, hear an ALERT sound to either your iPhone, ipad, etc.!!!!!  This is the BEST Feature, by far, as I've Booked 4 "FLIGHTS" now, all on the ALERT program, as all 4 times, the price(s) REDUCED, Significantly!!!!!  It was almost too Good to be True, but TRUE STORY!!!!!!  I LOVE this App and NOBODY could go WRONG in purchasing it, TRUST ME!!!!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Mr) Excellent app

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app) Easy to use!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app) Efficient, interesting, and useful for checking multiple flight options.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great!) Cool interface and great flight status tracking tool.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app) Easy use for travel planning in one place

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Awesome!!) Love this site! I live overseas because my husband is in the military and I find the BEST deals on this site.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Love Kayak) Have lived off their website to plan/book my trips for both work & personal. Now with app I have quick accesses to trip planning at my finger tips.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Yup) It is very helpful and because of it I'm booked for my trip!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Excellent Design, Simplified Presentation) A truly world-class app that's designed with unbelievable simplicity & presents complex information with ease!

Version 21.0.2 4
 (The best way to start your search) I've been using kayak for years, the best way to see the rates once you think of a trip. The only downfall is, it doesn't have some smaller or private airlines listed like jet blue.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Greatest App EVER for finding cheap travel and trip organizing) This is the best iPad app for making and organizing all of your travel arrangements.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Very useful!!!) First time to use 100% success! Will use again!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great!) New update works great! Worth having this app on all devices!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app!) Great app.  Reliable every time

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Great app

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Awesome app) Phenomenal app it helps me a lot.
The only thing is that they should include jet blue and southwest airlines.

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Best Deals) Kayak consistently found the best prices for me, although it is sometimes difficult to figure out the routes without lots of checking. (Best Price often isn't the best route).

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Nice !) Good app !

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Awesome app!) Awesome app!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Huge improvement) Love, love, love the new app.  So fast and user-friendly that I find myself seating for flights just for fun.  Hands down the best airline search app out there.  

The +\- day search function isn't great and needs some tweaking.  When you search for +\- a day, the search result doesn't indicates what dates the flights you are looking at depart/arrive so you have to click into the details for each.  Also, you can't search either + or -, you can only choose both.

But for standard searches, this app rocks.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (*) A real time saving comparison of fights.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app!) Really good app. I fully recommend it.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Mr) Very good app

Version 21.0.2 5

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app) Very fast

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Prez) Not as comprehensive as their web site but for an iPhone app, it's extremely good. If you use Kayak on the 'run', this app is great. I'm biased because I'm a big Kayak fan already.

Version 21.0.2 4
 (K . Merriman) Great convenience. Good site.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great! Easy!) It's easy and web you find fares you can easily share them and email them. I like this app. Easy to use and gives the best prices.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Kayak) Easier than the website and very helpful to check prices while on the go. Seems to have the lowest prices of the other apps that I have used.

Version 21.0.2 1
 (awful new version) The previous version of this app was truly awesome, with superb sorting capabilities and flexibility.  When I tried to use it this morning the old app said it was being phased out and no longer supported, and linked to this version.  What a nightmare -- the user interface is clunkier than the old version, and some sorting functions seem to have been eliminated.  Basically, I find this new version woefully inadequate, and truly worthless.  I am deleting it as soon as I submit this review.

Version 21.0.2 1
 (Kayak hd) Since downloading, what is mistaken to be an updated app, it constantly shuts off.  At most, I'm able to run one search at a time. With it constantly shutting off, I have to constantly open the app and re-input my search criteria.  This app is terrible.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Useful and fun) Even if i dont need this app i enjoy using it. Works fast

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Sometimes Crashes) Crashes

Version 21.0.2 5

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Kayak) Kayak app is really helpful

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Sorry, expedia) This travel app beats all. Find the perfect flight at the perfect price at the perfect time...plus flight tracking, plus hotel search, plus rental cars, plus plus plus...FOR FREE! Kayak doesn't even charge booking fees so its a winner all the way around. Does all it claims plus some more. Great iphone layout. Thanksthanksthanksthanks.......!

Version 21.0.2 4

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Thumbs up!!!!!) Has everything I need and more and it seems way simpler to use,
We use apps like these a lot and always when you need an airline price it's confusing because some don't show you the return fare as well , this is easy to punch in and it's all clear concise info right there.. Way to go will defiantly be using this and ditching the others

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Kayak) I love this app. I have found better deals quicker than any website I have used on the computer. It is fast, easy, user friendly, and you can manipulate little changes.

Version 21.0.2 5

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app) Best travel app

 (Very Useful) Very useful and convenient!

Version 21.0.2 4
 (I'm addicted) This app is so easy to use on my phone that I wish I could travel more often just to have a reason to use it!

Version 21.0.2 3
 (Pretty Cool) Works great. Maps could be better and would like the date selector to include the day of the week.

Version 21.0.2 1
 (Why Change?) I don't understand why the change to this new app. All the space on the iPad screen and you can't set the dates without having to bounce back and forth between screens?! The "old" app let you do everything right from one screen. Old app was easy and quite honestly, fun to use. This new one stinks. Update the interface back to the old style!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Excellent tool!) Kayak has become my go-to app. for locating and booking flights. I used to use Orbitz. Kayak is sooo much easier to navigate and use.

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Good app) Kayak is a great site and this app does a pretty good job of bringing that to the iPhone in an iPhone-friendly way. Looking forward to enhancements, which I'm sure there will be, on the future.

Version 21.0.2 5

Version 21.0.2 4
 (So far so good!) Just started using this app. So far I find it very user friendly & it displays the info in a very easy to understand format. I haven't made any bookings yet, but it is only a matter of time.

Version 21.0.2 1
 (Prices are out of date) Tried using Kayak 3 times unfortunately each time their site shows prices which are out of date and lower than the actual price that the airlines are showing...they should get their data to be real time.  So far they are 0 for 3.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Super easy and efficient app!) Have used many times to book travel.

 (Awesome app. Much better than the previous hd version.) I'm loving this me app. They did a very nice job on the new version.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (One of the best travel apps) I use this for all my travel needs.  Sending emails to Kayak with my trip information and then being able to see it on my phone complete with updated flight times, rental car and hotel bookings is invaluable.  I also love the fact that I get an email when I get off the plane that tells me what baggage carousel my luggage is on.  Did I mention it's free!

Version 21.0.2 4
 (SEO gaming?) Good app, sure‚Ä¶but what's with the ridiculous title. Gaming iTunes SEO?

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Excellent itinerary app) I've planned about 4 trips with this app, compared to other websites such as tripmama.com and Travelocity.com, and this app gave me the lowest price every time. I would recommend this to anyone that makes trips very often.

 (I miss sidestep !) They killed a great site called sidestep. Kayak is falling short on their app. Nothing flows smoothly anymore. 

The developers should solicit input and act on it. 

Will re-review in another 60 days.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app) I've been using Kayak for years and always find the best rates!

Version 21.0.2 3
 (Slightly lacking) Great app except it is missing a crucial component that i love most about kayak which is to compile and alter my price alerts.

Version 21.0.2 2
 (Old app is much better) Have been using this app for a couple weeks. I can't believe this is the replacement for their old app. I want to trash this one and keep the old app which allows me much more control in my searches.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (More like website) I LOVE the new Kayak app! It has more of the features you find on the website. I especially like the my trips feature!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Very easy to use) Great apps easy to use great for short notice booking.very good!

Version 21.0.2 1
 (This is not an improvement.) The old version was much better.  They went the wrong direction with this update

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great!!) Amazing

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Kayak) The best app I'm never have

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Slick App) I've only just started using this app, so this is a preliminary review. I was a little skeptical at first but curious, so I decided to try it. I have always wanted an app like this to keep my trip information organized in one place so I can find details like confirmation numbers, flight times, etc. very quickly. 

I sent my flight and hotel email confirmations and I was blown away by how accurately Kayak parsed out the information and place it into their in a simple and logical way.  You can still pull up your email within the app, but it wouldn't typically be necessary.

I'm looking forward to trying some other features but even if it only does this, it would be an awesome app for any traveler.

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Time saver) Excellent options

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Great app!! Works like a charm.) Excellent app

Version 21.0.2 4

Version 21.0.2 5
 (nice) from what ive seen kayak is on point and has a load of options i havent seen a better travel app

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Works great. Super smooth. Love it!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Kayak is the best!) I always visit kayak before I book any trip. I work in hotels and I hate booking on Expedia or Priceline because the reservations can get lost. Kayak is the perfect substitute.

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Great!!) Love it!

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Flight track) Good program

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app) This app is really straight forward and easy to use, and it works really well.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Kick ace) Awesome

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great App!!) Has great features! Very handy!

Version 21.0.2 1
 (Never Again) This is a horrible service! I booked a flight through Kayak Connect and received an email from Kayak telling me that I can message them if the itinerary from Frontier airlines was different from what I ordered. 

Well it was different so I emailed them and all Kayak tells me is to contact Frontier to change or cancel. No I'm sorry or a list of other options. 

I called the airline only to find out that it would cost a total of $300 extra in fees to change my flight because that's the way kayak booked it and there was nothing they can do.

I'm very upset that kayak won't own up to the mistake and take care of the flight change back to my original flight time that I booked with them! I will never use kayak again and I urge everyone else to take caution because any mistake they make will be your responsibility

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great app) Awesome app, I recommend it.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Great) Always come here first for greatest rates

 (Easy to Use) A great place to plan a trip.

Version 21.0.2 3
 (NOT an improvement) I felt pressed to write a review...my first one.  This recent upgrade was not an improvement. More cumbersome and less intuitive than the previous incarnation. Still love Kayak, but wish they had left well enough alone.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great app!!) Works quickly and easy to use, I love it!!

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Best for Travel Prices) This app let's u know when your scheduled flight dates have dropped in price, makes it easy to purchase directly from the app. Only wish the flight feature applied to hotels

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Awesome app) Works great!

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Kayak) Use this app frequently! Wished Southwest would allow Kayak to show its prices as well.

 (Flight) Great search engine ANC alerts

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Kayak) I love it

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Love it!) This is my primary source for price comparison between airlines.

Thanks

-AG

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Great comparison tool, easy to use) I can always find who is offering the best price on flights for my travel needs using KAYAK.  Rental cars are not as easy since most sites have special deals if you click on certain links only from their site.  I did like KAYAK HD better, it was more intuitive and easier to navigate.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (Excellent app!) I've been using this app to plan my travel.  Wow I love it!

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Very good) It's wonderful. I use it everywhere I go. Planned a trip to Hawaii using this. Awesome 4 stars

Version 21.0.2 4
 (Pretty Good) Can't update fair alerts which in my opinion is significant.

Version 21.0.2 1
 (Still Unappy; JUST USE TRIPIT) I used to love this app, but, about 4-5 months ago, they did a complete redesign of it which completely destroyed it usefulness. The app works well on the iPad, but on the iPhone, it is  useless. The new "cards" layout (which they seem to have blatantly copied from a competing product by the way) is difficult to read and impossible to quickly scan through your itinerary. Main problems: 1. Your information is compressed into way too small of a space, leaving most of the screen unutilized and making it impossible to really see any detail. 2. If you drill down into a specific item (like hotel for example, again, the same problem. The information is compressed in to a small space and you cannot see all the details (20% of the address runs off the screen for example). 3. No distinctions marking different days in your itinerary; it is just one long list. The dates are given in the details if you look, but again, what happened to scan-ability? 4 - Offline functionality is inconsistent. Normally, it should cache your information from online so you can still access your data when you do not have an internet connection (e.g. on a plane). But, this is hit and miss. Sometimes it works and other times the app just decides it wants to download new data, so it deletes everything currently stored in the cache and tries to go online to get the new info. If there is no connection, well, the cache has already been dumped, so you are out of luck now.

Honestly, this app is now horrible and Kayak either has no interest to fix it or they simply do not listen to their users. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND GO DOWNLOAD TRIPIT INSTEAD. The base service is just as good and the App is far better on the iPhone (about equal for the iPad).

Version 21.0.0 3
 (Not Like the Original) The original app was easier to navigate and had a better interface.  It's still my number 1 app for travel but the developers ruined a good app that didn't need improving.  Bring back the old interface and I'll give it 5 stars.

Version 21.0.2 5
 (It just works) Amazingly useful!!!!

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Pretty good) Don't like it as much as the web version, but gets the job done.

Version 21.0.2 1
 (A great travel app) But, like many other programs, it nags you to write a review. And there is no "No" option, just an "OK" and "Later" option. So, for usefulness of the app, I give 4 stars. For nagging, I deduct 3 stars.

Version 21.0.2 5

Version 21.0.0 5

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Super user friendly!) I don't think I'd change. It's as user friendly as it gets!!

Version 21.0.0 3
 (Kayak) Este app es muy f√°cil para usa, pero no lo tiene muchos opciones en mi opini√≥n

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Doesn't work) Just updated to the new app and it keeps freezing

Version 21.0.0 5
 (BA) Great App!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Good app) Very easy to use and shows best prices!

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Deleting app because you pulled ads from T.V. Show) I am deleting your Kayak app from my iPhone because of Kayak's ridiculous decision to discontinue advertising during the television show "All-American Muslim". I find it utterly idiotic that Kayak chose to do this and still chooses to not advertise during the television program all due to the completely false allegations and racist and hate filled letters of the Florida Family Association. Did anyone at Kayak actually watch an episode of this program before pulling your ads?  I doubt it. Kayak must not believe in diversity and inclusion. What a bunch of bigots.

Version 21.0.0 1

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Loves the original) The new one is slow and crashes, wait before updating, you won't be able to do anything with this one.  But I do love the new look, and it looks like when they do get it working it will be a ton better.

Version 21.0.0 1

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Very useful and easy!!!) Love the Kayak app!

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Great new app...) Great new app, keep up the good work. Would love if you could get the airlines on board to have a 1-click type experience. This app is so great it's hard to leave to the airlines site.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Luv it and it's free) I luv it so far!! Shows all the price comparsion.

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Only search for planes works, if it all worked it would be a great app, and I would use it more.) To bad, this would be one of the best apps ever. Good thing it was free, guess I will have to delete it.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great App) Great travel app!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great!) Very good

 (Crash) Crash Crash Crash 
Unusable. Every time I hit search it crashes. No clue what to rate the actual app since I can't even open it. One star I guess until u fix it.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (GREAT APP!) Very helpful especially at the Airport to check flight changes or delays.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Very Useful App) Kayak is a real time saving planning tool.   I always check Kayak before booking reservations, and before heading to the airport to pick up arriving guests. I love being able to follow flights in real time.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Kayak) Great app and it's so amazing that it's free. I would actually pay for it if there were a charge for it.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Clear, understandable information) The cure for the common travel site. Great for research but booking the tickets can still be a P.I.T.A.

Version 21.0.0 3
 (Ok) It's just ok

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Version 2 is good!) I had the first version, but it never worked well and would lose my place when switching back and forth between apps. This version is great! A much improved UI and experience!

Version 21.0.0 3
 (Seems to be ok; crashes a bit) App seems to perform well, except that it crashes when too a lot of search results get returned. iOS 4.xx, iPhone 3G

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Disappointing) Wonderful user interface, but doesn't work when attempting to book with Delta.  Then when I recreate on the Delta site, I can't get the itinerary I want and the price jumped 20% .

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great!) Sometimes shows different fares than website. Also this is limited by screen size as I love the flex dates table you get on the full site.

Version 21.0.0 5

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Awesome app) Great app

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great app) Prices are the best so far.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Best Travel App in the store!!!) There are a lot of travel related apps out there, but Kayak does the job the best!! Quick searches, easy to use interface and the only one that will let you actually BUY your ticket or make your reservation. I have used a lot of other apps that have full websites, Kayak provides all those features in this one app. If you are serious about travel and want to compare prices, flight times, durations as well as hotel and car choices, this is the only app to get!!!

Version 21.0.0 5

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Easy to use) I especially like the new app!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Handy App) Nice having this app to help with travel plan. Thanks.

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Everything you expect...almost.) It's just what you expect from a kayak.com app except for the matrix function that allows you to see flight prices based on a + or - 3 day basis. Otherwise it's fast and easy to use.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (My Favorite Travel App) I fly about twice a month and I can't live without this app now. I used to use TripIt and they wanted to charge for the same features Kayak offers free. Great app, no bugs.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Easy to use) Great!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Good app) So far it has worked fine. No complaints.

Version 21.0.0 2

Version 21.0.0 5

 (Love) Great app

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Mr) I've been looking for a travel site that would give me All destinations from a specific airport for years. The new Kayak does that and give you fares too!
This is my only travel site for air from now on. Tripadvisor, I love the hotel reviews, but watch out.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Awesome!) Great app, very useful and easy to use!

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Well Done, but....) You can't select a departure for later chose a different return.....like the version for PC's

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Sweet) Great one stop shopping for the lowest cost anything travel related!!

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Kayak) I am constantly getting knocked out of this app on my iPad while searching at car rentals. I don't know if it is my new iPad, the app/Kayak or what but it is extremely annoying.  I get to the pricing page and look at my options and boom - I am back at my main ipad screen.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Kayak) Nice.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Look up travel while on the go) Easy to use. I've used it to look up potential flights or hotels while on the go.

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Great app) Great travel tool

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Perfectly adequate) I only use it for searching always preferring to buy through a more secure connection. Works just fine for my purposes. Good looking UI, too.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Speechless) I am so stunned on the simplicity and organization of this app, it has everything you need, Flights, Hotels, and Vehicle Rentals! And it all so simple you can find the cheapest flights, you can even find top quality hotels for under $200 a night

Version 21.0.0 5
 (I'm done!) I will never use another travel site again if Kayak can manage to maintain its simple and straightforward interface.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Happy) I like this app so much I have used it 4 times on my trip in 2 weeks, I recommended it to 2 people leaving my hotel lobby because the rates are sooooo much better and brought them back to the hotel 10 minutes later.
Everyone is pinching their pennies and needs to save time Kayak saves time.... Thank you

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great app...) Helpfully and easy to use!

Version 21.0.0 1

 (Excelente) Me Gusta...

Version 21.0.0 5
 (The Best) I never travel, but on the blue moon that I do, kayak's got my back. Thank you!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Ultimate travel app) Best and easiest travel app

Version 21.0.0 5
 (My buena aplicaci√≥n) Perfecto para buscar pasajes y hoteles convenientes.

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Missing airlines!) I want to like this app, and in fact it works great. However no JetBlue and its the main airline serving my area. No JetBlue flight info at all. Can't give more than one star for this reason.

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Missing fav feature) My favorite feature is gone. On flight searches, there used to be a slider for departing times and landing times.  Now you have to choose between crazy early, early morning, late morning and so on.  For example, I need to depart noon or later. I used to put the slider at noon and it displayed ALL flights departing at noon or later.  Now... You have to select the early afternoon timeframe, which shows only flights in that several hour time window. So, for example a 4:30pm flight will not be shown. To make it worse, The time filter will not let you select multiple timeframes to include,say, early afternoon, late afternoon and early evening.  So, you have to manually go in and research each timeframe. Taking away the sliders is a huge step backward and makes this app a no-go for me. I hope the old version will continue to work.  Maybe in the next release, the sliders can be an option.  They were great on the iPad.

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Great app) Very fast and super easy to use.

Version 21.0.0 3
 (So so) Like the old app better.  More visual and easier to use.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Easy to use) This is a good app. Don't need to check several sites, just use this one.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great!) Exactly what I needed!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great application) Very easy to use - gives you all the functionality of a full computer travel search engine in the palm I'd your hands. 

First used Kayak on blackberry platform - works more more smoothly on iPhone.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Very nice) Quick, well designed, easy to navigate.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great app from great website!) Kayak is always the best. The app is perfect, easy and has all the features that you would want in it...

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Love this app.) Awesome app! Very convenient

 (Great) I've always used kayak and it is very nice to have while youre moving!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Very helpful) Excellent apps. Help you plan your travel cheaper

Version 21.0.0 4
 (New Kayak) Lillte better UI than before. I want to see the matrix view also.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Awesome) Fantastic app!! Easier than the computer!

Version 21.0.0 3
 (Missing Sliders!) Would have been an easy 5 stars had it had the sliders.  Kayak, time sliders are what make you more useful that other travel search engines; why remove them??  Now I have to try each travel time window separately, just like Expedia, etc.  Kayak was always the once and done site.  Please bring back the sliders!

Version 21.0.0 1
 (New flights list very confusing) The new flight list gives you 500 flights to choose except when you take time to look at them all they seem to really be the same 3 or 4 flights different only by the intermediate stops. A real waste of time and effort compared to the old app.  The slider bar for departure and arrival times was much better than the new check box categories.  Bring back the old app or I'm looking for another service.

Version 21.0.0 4
 (DeathDealer) Great app easy to find & shop around for what ur lookin for but have trouble booking package deals ????

Version 21.0.0 5

Version 21.0.0 2
 (No joy) Latest upgrade has issues. Can't locate flights for Dec 2012 to St Kitts. No editable field to enter an alternative airport to include in search.  Need to be able to set default or preferred airports for departures.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (-) This app's interface is even more convenient than that on the web site.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Awesome !!) Great app

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great) I used to go in web site when I am at work and I like it to the maximum . Thanks

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great travel app) Love this app. Can do almost everything you can on the website.

Version 21.0.0 2
 (Lost features) This app is a step down from the previous HD app.  It's missing time customization and won't even tell me where stopovers are on multi leg flights.  Disappointing.

Version 21.0.0 5

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Excellent) Just the needed information in a nice format.

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Nice app) Easy to use and listed many options. If you are looking for a cheap flight, use this app.

Version 21.0.0 4
 (95% there) A must-have to shop for travel, but results should be double checked, especially when traveling between "exotic" countries. Cheaper prices might be available on their website, directly.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Simply perfect) Don't change a thing. Perfect as is.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great app!) Perfect for finding cheap tickets quickly.  I love that it compares flights from multiple sites.  I also like the ability to search hotels and others travel needs.  The ability to save searches is great too.  I would like to see the iPhone app talk to the iPad app to simplify searches from both devices.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Everything I didn't know I needed!) This app is beyond what I expected and so easy to use! If you are an expert at scouting out the best fares or inexperienced, this app is perfect! Has a built in price alert system with push notifications for fare updates. It also provides the history for Specific flights!

Version 21.0.0 5

 (Exelente!!!!!) Exelente

Version 21.0.0 3
 (Gabe, you forgot some things) I miss the slider to set my own arrival and departure time ranges rather than the predefined ranges. Also, Gabe, what about comparing the cost of flying to other modes of transportation-- say Amtrak or BoltBus. That would be especially useful for planning a trip to NYC from Boston.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Excellent Travel App!!!) This is probably the best app for making travel plans. Very easy to use.

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Better than most not sure about new version) Not sure if I like new version but beats other sites hands down.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Awesome App Awesome Customer Service) Not only is this a great app, the customer service is beyond compare. 

In my excitement at the ease of use as compared to other travel apps I've tried, I forgot to put in my hotel reservation dates. As a result, the hotel was booked for the very next day (In NYC). 

I called the company when I realized what I had done, and learned that the reservation was non-refundable because it was for a stay less than 24 hrs away.  I thought I was gonna lose that money for sure. ($350)

But they told me not to worry, they would handle it. They put me on hold, contacted the hotel, and not only did they get my money back, they changed the reservation for me as well. I never even had to talk to the hotel's customer service. They did it all for me. 

If my story doesn't convince you this app is worth getting, then you really never intended to get it in the first place. 

They deserve 10 stars not 5.

 (My travel agent) Sorry to my old one, but this app does it all and even better!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Kayak app) This app is much easier to use than the website!

Version 21.0.0 3
 (Let me find my airport!!!) For some reason this app doesn't find the airport, even if I type the title correctly. (ie: Sacramento: SMF, says the airport doesn't exist) so that can be really frustrating to just browse for flights while I have free time and need to.

 (Excellent) Best travel booking app

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Best travel site ever!) I have tried lots but Kayak includes the best of them, so why go elsewhere?

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Monopoly) When I downloaded the app I was already familiar with the game but being able to play when its a down period makes it better. I'm able to play my own music through my I pod. So I'm jamming and buying real estate only in America!!!!!!!! Now I'm on to the game of "Life". Thanks for the great App

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great App!) Easy to use.

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Awesome idea. Crashes every time I use it.) The interface looks awesome, it's very accessible and easy to use, but the app crashes after every search. I can get as far as seeing the lowest rate- but if I try to scroll through the list, the app  shuts down. It's like having a huge amazing trampoline with really worn out springs. Jump all you want, this apps got nothin (til the bugs are worked out).

Version 21.0.0 5

One suggestion (well, two): fix the crashing, and include a feature to send email alerts on particular flights (like you can online)

 (Bugs and crashes) I only gave it 2 stars because I love kayak. This app is totally useless for me.  It seems to choose dates and searches on it's own, and will not let me go back.  Eventually, it just shuts off and crashes every time.  Funny because nobody else is mentioning it, but this is the first app of about 60 that I have had any problems with. Any other iPad users having this issue?

 (Best travel app!!) I've been using kayak since someone whispered it to me like it was a secret, and it still seems to be the case. I check it's results against other popular sites and it always either beats them or ties. Great app!

Version 21.0.0 5

 (Easy and Useful!) Like the app and find it intuitive

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Handy app for the road!) I prefer this app then the Hotwire app, because this app doesn't require the location service on the iPhone in order to work. Unfortunately I have Sprint and I not always have enough signal for the location service to work, but this app still helped me to find a hotel room on the hills of TN. Easy to use and it works!

 (Great app!!) The best app out there when it comes to searching for flights!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Better than the website) As other reviewers have pointed out, the app is really user-friendly and works really well. It is such a good app, that I don't bother turning on my laptop sometimes and just browse flights from my iPhone.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Brilliant...) ...all kinds of brilliant.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Best app out there for searching for flights.) This app works awesome. Other apps like Travelocity give you a low price but it goes up when you try to book. Not this one!!!

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Fantastic) This app is so user friendly that I use it now instead of the website.

Version 21.0.0 4
 (One touch view) Great app , works way better than the web version

Version 21.0.0 2
 (Sometimes change is not a good thing) The previous version of the Kayak mobile app had everything I wanted. Now, I do not have the ability to set or view price alerts, inspite of what technical suppport says. I shall wait for the next update, or I can delete this and restore the prrevious installation from the backup.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Easy to use) Great app easy to use and all of the prices (except Southwest) in one place.  Fantastic!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Love this app!) It's easy to use and I love how you can email travel plans and it's organized. I like this better than tripit. The coolest thing is if you put in your home airport it shows a picture of the world and how much airfares are!

Version 21.0.0 4
 (JET BLUE Airlines) WHY ARE THERE NOT JET BLUE FLIGHTS TO FORT MYERS NOT LISTED

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Great!) Always use Kayak online to shop for best deals and the app is actually easier to use imo

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Overall great app but....) One really annoying feature that they are lacking is a true type ahead for airports. For instance I need to know to type Bridgetown or Grantly Adams instead of Barbados. I personally would like to see consistency with their website where it is smart enough to point me to an airport by typing in the abbreviation, city or country name. After all the whole point of this is so you don't have to leave the app to look something up.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Nice) Very good website.  Nice design too.

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Fantastical) Title says it all!! :)

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great App) Great app.. This one should be an example of how apps should be. Super user friendly and super functional.. Thanks to the app designers at kayak.

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Why are prices higher then airlines website?) This app would be amazing if the prices reflected the online prices for the airlines.   The price on the app is a lot higher!  Why?

Version 21.0.0 4
 (New version buggy!) Just updated today, and the new version has some bugs. Specifically, I keep getting booted out when I try to filter my flight search results. (like when I try to deselect certain days or slide the arrival time bar). 

However, it has been a great app. Wish that this app included all the same search options as the website, like date flexibility, custom multi-airport searches, and so on. Solid performer, mostly.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Nice!) Good app! Nice!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Wonderful app) Fun, easy to use, amazing!!

Version 21.0.0 4
 (Booting me off a little ....) Pretty rad most of the time.been booting me off the last few days-my faith is super high however:/) thanks for the ticket advice--goin to Puerto Rico

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Fantastic!) This is, by far, the best travel app. Every aspect was well thought out, programmed, and smart. I love the flight tracker option. Highly recommend for anyone!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (The Best travel app going!!) The best travel app going!!!!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great new features) I love the new feature that sends results by email. And the flight tracker is free!

Version 19.0.0 5
 (It's Kayak, on your phone) Kayak is an incredibly useful website that allows you to search for flights, hotels, cars, and virtually any other travel reservations you may need.  I recommend you you use the website before you use the app.

The app gives you basic access to the website.  It is the kind of app that I continually delete and re-install: every couple of months I clean out my applications and think to myself, why in the world do I need an app to look-up and book travel?  Then, inevitably, a couple of weeks later I find myself re-installing the app because I need it.  If you ever need to book (or re-book) travel on the road, or just get a quick price check on travel, this is the app to get.

Version 21.0.0 3
 (Unstable) Crashes during flight search.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Pretty good app) It's rather better then those travel apps that cost 2 dollars. Would recommend to stick to this app and not waste your money.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great App!) Works great for finding & notifying you of cheap/affordable flight tickets. I'm always saving $ with it.

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Kayak) Great Application. Easy to use and a saving program for the user. A+++++

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Best flight booking app) Have been using kayak since 2006 and always worked for me. I'm actually surprised the airlines haven't managed to kill its business model as they almost did with Priceline. In any case, this app brings all the pros and none of the cons of the website to a little device called the iPhone. I enjoy it!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Download it) Great user interface, fun to use.....better than their website

Version 21.0.0 4

 (Favorite Travel App) This is definitely my favorite travel app- I appreciate not only the flight search feature, but also the packing list and currency converter.

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Rental car info not transferring properly) Needed a car from Cincinnati to chicago, kayak only receives rental car prices on same city returns even though it makes you think otherwise. Ended up costing me 208 $ I'm not so happy, they need to fix this

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great App) I use frequently and love it!

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Lost iPhone features) I installed the iPhone version on my ipad because it has more features than the iPad version ie price change notifications. Now that it's a universal app, I've lost those features. 

Make both versions the same!

Version 21.0.0 5
 (Great app) Absolutely great. Good deals.

Version 21.0.0 3
 (Slow but Ok) Took forever to download my trip itenerary.  Won't let me change my trip name. There's a box to type in but the cursor doesn't start blinking when you tap inside it to type. Review will change to higher rating when fixed.

Version 21.0.0 1
 (Vayama ruins an otherwise great app.) Kayak is a great service and this app is flawless except for one "little"thing. I'm  only giving them 1 star in hopes that this brings some attention to their poor judgement in featuring Vayama in their search results.
Vayama is a terrible company and their customer service leaves a whole lot to be desired! 
There's absolutely no excuse in this day and age to have to wait 24 hours to find out if they were able to book your flight or not. I've lost precious time and money dealing with this sham of a company. I will happily change my rating for this app when Vayana gets dropped from Kayak, but until then no soup for you!

 (Real American) I am deleting this app based on your company's decision to cave to anti-Arab propaganda from a crazy un-American fringe groups attack on a television show that depicts real Arab americans. Living and striving to live the American dream. Your app is the best travel app of all I have tried on the app store but you spinelessness and un-American actions mean for me I can not support your company or service.

Version 19.0.6 1
 (Will never use again) The ap was barely OK.  Would probably continue to use it, but the company took marketing direction from a racist, fundamentalist organization.  Kayak sided with racist - I am taking my business elsewhere.

Version 19.0.6 5
 (Fabulous) Helpful and handy!!!

Version 19.0.6 1
 (Don't like bigotry) For a company focused on travel, you'd think they would be more, oh I don't know, global-minded? To be clear: kayak.com removed ads from a TV show that dared to portray Muslim-Americans as normal, dignified humans because a group of evangelical Christians from Florida complained. 

App deleted.

Version 19.0.6 1
 (Deleted as of today) Bigotry will not be tolerated. I'll use another company from here on out.

Version 19.0.6 5
 (My favorite) This is my favorite go to travel app.

Version 19.0.6 1

 (POS) No longer show results for Jet Blue (only airline that flies non-stop out of JAX to SJU) Glitch, I doubt it!  I used to think Kayak was different, but this shows they have fallen into the fold with the other biggies loads up results with AA, Delta and US Airways at almost triple the cost and with at least one layover. To think I used them to book stuff in the past humph! No more!

Version 19.0.5 5
 (Kayak rocks!) I have to join the rest of the App Store community in singing Kayak's praises.  A lifesaver for the frequent traveler--couldn't be simpler to use, and really keeps my trips organized.

 (Kayak app) Great app... Buying is not always the easiest and sometime the currency slips back to pound rather than dollar or which ever currency I am currently working with.  Bottom line it's the best travel app I have come across and gives you an idea of prices and is the best thing to have if your on the run and need to grab a last minute flight.

Version 19.0.5 5
 (3.5m miles and counting) Kayak, for the casual traveler is 'handy' and saves hours of mindless web surfing.  For the savvy traveler, looking for bargains and hidden cities it is best to use the web app I am rating five stars. Best part is the filter  and look at connecting cities. All up a good tool to narrow the fight for cheaper airfares once you get used to small keyboard issues.  Best on iPhone .  Booking ya generally easy and accomplishes the need pretty quickly.   Checking in us a plus as well.   Fir a free app pretty well done!

 (Essential Travel Tool) Travelers can't do without Kayak. That said, I think earlier versions of this app were easier to use & had more features & functionalities that I liked.

 (Scam!) Tried the app out. Tried booking a room and all I got were error messages. So I went to another hotel, directly booking. I get an email confirmation a day later after the app gave me error messages..

Called Kayak and they refused to refund charges. Said they couldn't because the email was sent. EVEN though it was nearly 24 hours later. 

Such crap. Take your business elsewhere!

Version 19.0.3 1

Version 19.0.3 3
 (Great choices but...) Lots of options in results for both flight and hotel and super easy to use! But no hotel and flight package options AND the app suddenly closes for no reason and I have to restart the app and search process. Very annoying!

Version 19.0.3 5
 (Amazing) It's very easy to use!!!!!!

Version 19.0.2 2
 (Application closes when multitasking) Multi tasking doesn't work very well

Version 19.0.2 3
 (Add flight information) Why can't I add my own flight information? I add information you give push notification. It's really simple. I don't want to send you an email. I don't need one more cyber paper trail of my activities.  Allow me to put in airline and flight number. You already have the time. C'mon, it's 2011, catch up.

Kayak found the cheapest flight, & with min flight changes & layovers, so I booked the ticket on the spot...all from my iphone while relaxing on the lanai. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Version 19.0.2 5
 (Fantastic!) Convenient, easy to use, full of helpful information! Favorite thing is being able to add trips by simply forwarding my confirmation email. I can even sync all the trips to my google calendar with a few clicks. Great app, highly recommend to anyone!

Version 19.0.2 5
 (Love it!) I took a 30 day motorcycle trip in July. The App always found us savings. We couldn't have had a better trip. We travel on a whim and decide while driving. You don't need to pre-plan with this app.

Version 19.0.2 5
 (Cool app! Very resourceful!) Handy tool to check all flight options and prices available out there. The mobile version is very fast too

Version 19.0.2 5

 (Essential) Works great on on angles of traveling! Would recommend to anyone who is  a multi tasker or would like to be more efficient at plaining a trip, or wants peace of mind/ reassurance... To sum it up this app has your back :)

Version 17.0.3 1
 (TOTALLY UNTRUSTWORTHY!) I DO NOT trust any app that requires full access to my contacts.  That has nothing to do with the service and everything to do with invasive data mining on me, my family, and my friends.  I don't appreciate being taken advantage of like that from an app.  What else is Kayak.com stealing from us?  

I deleted this spyware app and I'll just use travel websites like I always used to; the app is not all that convenient anyway.  My advice is to spare yourself and those you care about by doing the same.  Google is soon going to compete in this space, also.  Let's see what that's like.

Version 19.0.2 5

 (Kayak) Best travel tool ever!!

Version 19.0.2 5
 (GREAT!!) Great App.

Version 19.0.2 5
 (Best deal.) I always find the best deal for rental cars and flights via Kayak.

Version 19.0.2 5
 (Kayak) This app rocks. It beats the airline apps by hundreds of dollars on tickets.

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Carlsbad "Taxi" mommy) Excellent- saves money

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Kayak) Great app

Version 19.0.1 3
 (Not impressed) If you want to know what hotels are in a certain area, then yay- you'll have a lot to choose from, but after that it gets dicey. The prices aren't that great (or even accurate, when you get to the actual booking stage), it lists a lot of B&B's that you have to either call or email for rates (if I wanted to spend time hunting them down I'd have done it before I left town) and some of the descriptions of the nearby attractions aren't close to being accurate. I don't know who writes those, so it may not be fair to penalize Kayak for that, but I don't consider an attraction 2.5 miles away from my hotel to be "walking distance", particularly in the summertime.  The app is easy to use- too bad the info's not more reliable.

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Kayak) Fast and efficient ... Finally a travel app that does what it's supposed to do.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Great!) Recently booked my entire trip to Japan using this app. Easy to use, cool design, and same great service as Kayak.com!

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Great travel help.) On road trips never know when I'll be stopping so when I decide to stop I put in where I am and get hotel listings.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Site) Awesome will always need it!

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Excellent app) You can even book the flights here 
ÓÄé

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Great) Great app.

Version 19.0.1 5

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Very well done) The app is professionally put together, responsive, and useful(best of all)

Version 19.0.1 5

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Great app!!!!) This app it really good no need to go to a website

Version 19.0.1 5
 (A BIG fan of good design - so Thank You.) Amazing job well done on this app. Give your Information Architect, design, dev, and PM teams responsible for this a hardy handshake for me. One of the best apps I've used on iOS. Certainly great enough to get this wallflower to sing praise.

I have to admit I'm more of an Expedia fan on the web. Or rather 'was'. I'm a big fan of things that are well designed - this app just turned me into a Kayak'r.

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Best Travel Site/App) It works

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Excellent!) Very good app!

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Great app!!) Filters work great and the app is easy to use!

Version 19.0.1 5
 (good collection of sources) You don't have to have all the answers:  you just have to know where to find them. Kayak helps you get answers to your travel questions.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Good) Simple.

Version 19.0.1 4
 (Great except flight tracker) Great for booking flights, hotels and anything else. The current version does not find my flight in the tracker (5 star if this is fixed)

Version 19.0.1 4
 (Kayak) Like the price alerts

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Best Travel App Out There!) Simply the best.  The only downside is that I have to use the mobile site (even at my desk) to follow a flight.  Otherwise the flight tracking is better than my own airline's on-line reservation site!!

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Kayak rocks) This is the best travel app I've ever used. Found and booked a hotel in another country in minutes. Also found the absolute best deal for this hotel in a matter of min. Kayak knows what's up for the busy no-nonsense type that wants the best deal.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Awesome. Almost as good as the website) A little less customizable than the full kayak website, but it has notifications for low fare alerts without the need to register.

Version 18.0.0 5
 (The best) Kayak is the best travel site/ap available.

Version 19.0.1 5
 (V. Good) Very nice and handy tool

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Awesome app) Great website, great service, even awesomer app!

Version 19.0.1 5
 (works better than Delta's internal search engine) I could not believe that Kayak was able to find particular round trip for 1300 USD while Delta's web site was giving me 1800 USD for same dates, same origination, same destination!

Version 19.0.1 5
 (Excellent) Hands down best flight tracker software ive seen in an app

 (Very user friendly) Finally, a travel app that makes sense and you actually can use!

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Clean App) The use of this app is clean and smooth. Excellent high quality photos of each hotel. I am not much of a review reader when it comes to hotels but I found some very helpful feedback. Now I know where not to go for the holidays. Thanks Kayak.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (It gets the job done) Great app! Could be improved as searched results are lost when trip details are viewed.. But definitely a great tool!

Version 19.0.0 5

Version 19.0.0 4
 (Well) Well its alright with me

Version 19.0.0 4
 (Good apps!!) Easy to use.... Good deals..

Version 19.0.0 4
 (Kayak ap) This is a great ap, but if you search a flight for 2 or more passengers, the price you are shown is for 1 passenger. Why don't they total the cost? This is also the case for a hotel stay that is for more than 1 night. If you get a hotel quote for 10 nights, it doesn't quote the total. It only displays the price per night.

Version 19.0.0 4
 (Flyby) Solid.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Very easy to use. Powerful!) This is my favorite travel app.

Version 19.0.0 5

 (IT) This aps is not working for flight tracking. They never update the flight information. Just as an example this weekend the flight was cancelled and this aps still shows time of arrival, basically it gives the wrong information

Version 19.0.0 5
 (5) Very useful.

Version 19.0.0 5

Version 19.0.0 4
 (Dixie) Outstanding

Version 19.0.0 2
 (Used be my 5 Star) I was recommending Kayak to every one.   Now with the latest release, I am starting to use TripIt more.   Why?   The basic item, keeping track of my trips was changed radically.   Now it's difficult to glance at it and grasp info.  It feels like I am reading an email.   

I am hoping tor my trips Kayak will revert back to the better format they had before.  I am also finding out Kayak prices are not always good for flights.   I find Orbitz provides better prices, so just relying on Kayak will literally cost me.  

Kayak just opened the door for Tripit and others.

Version 19.0.0 5

 (Excellent!) Kayak is the best travel planning app around.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Love this app!) This has always been my fave flight booking app on my iPhone. Only 2 things I wish they'd add back that I loved from older version was the (1) "Prefer Non-Stop" right on the flight search page and (2) the older home page look that had the icon squares setup to choose your search type etc. Kind of like home page of iPhone where you could rearrange them & scroll left/right between pages. I know that's a few versions back but I can't stop wishing they'd kept those options. Oh well. Still my fave nonetheless. Keep rockin it Kayak :)

 (As important as a Passport!) I don't even think about traveling without checking into Kayak, and this app is sweet: fully functional, quick & easy!!

Version 19.0.0 5
 (My review) I've tried all the travel apps.  Two stand out.  Expedia and Kayak.

Expedia is good but does't seem to have all the hotels/motels listed.

Kayak not only seems to have a larger database for hotels/motels, it does so much more.  Add to that a map function that leaves the rest in the dust.

The flight functions are great and work better than expected.

All in all, a very great app.  If it wasn't free, it would be worth at least a $9.95 investment.

Definitely a 5 star +.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Don't travel without it!) I love to travel and kayak makes sure I get to do it at the best price without wasting time searching every travel site on the Internet.

 (Easy to use) I love this app. It is easy and basic. Gets the job done while saving me a ton of money and time.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Super user friendly!) Downloaded this app and booked 3 airline tickets. 

- The search process was so seamless that I can even argue it is much easier to get the job done using this app than using the website from a computer. 

- Gives u many different options when searching for flights like +/- 2 day, nearby airports, time range, price range, etc.

- not only does it do the job, but it looks good in doing so. Buttons are in the right spots, very quick response, nice colors and most importantly- user friendly. 

That's my review from booking flights.  Haven't tried the hotel, car search from this app.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (Love this app) I have no complaints. I love this app and use it whenever I'm flying. Wish SW would come onboard and fearful Airtran will no longer be available with the acquisition. But none of that has to do with the app which is awesome.

Version 19.0.0 5
 (The best!) The only app we use to book travel!

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Great app!) Although I don't quite understand how and why, I found the ticket in this app in better time and price than in the computer when I ran the two kayak at the same time. I chose to buy that iphone-only ticket and it's fast and easy. Unbelievable app!

 (Great app with few missing features) This is a great app. It has a broad and powerful search engine. 

The one thing I have found this to be missing is adding the layover limiter feature. You can find the perfect flight at the perfect price, except if the layover is 9 hours. So a layover limiter parameter would be helpful. Integrate this into the push alert feature and you've got a 5-star app.

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Nice App) Awesome.

Version 18.0.0 4
 (Very useful!) I am using it as a trip planner/organizer more than anything, but I am amazed at how helpful this is! I did do a hotel search with it, but I ended up booking directly through the chain's site by choice. Prices were accurate, though, and VERY helpful.

The currency converter, airport info, airline fees, airline directory and checklists are a great addition. The ability to email your confirmations in is simply amazing and works very well. All of them were recognized (even my Amtrak connection) and automatically added to My Trips with an extremely high degree of accuracy. Even if there are a few errors, you can simply log in to the website quickly and fix them. But that brings me to the reason why I took away a star from a full 5 - you cannot currently edit or delete any of the My Trips entries from the app. I used the in-app contact form to ask, and they confirmed this (within 30 minutes of my asking early on a Saturday, BTW! Wow!). You must do it from the website. If they add this in the future, I will definitely give it a full 5. I might even consider buying the paid version to get rid of the ads! :)

Always stable on my iPod Touch.

Comprehensive. 90% of the time, I've never found a cheaper price on any other site. The other 10% of the time, Kayak's been off by at most a few bucks. No other travel search site comes close, pricing-wise.

I have several hundred apps and this is one of my top 10.

Version 18.0.0 4
 (Great App!) Does exactly what I need it to!

Version 18.0.0 2
 (Would be good if it generated accurate prices) I can't even imagine what people are raving about with this app.  Search results return prices for hotels - but when drilling down on a specific hotel, it gives a significantly higher price than is reflected in the results list for at least 30-40% of the locations. (and, no... I don't mean the slightly higher price that reflects fees/taxes).  Plus it has crashed when viewing maps & pics within the app on my iPad.

Version 18.0.0 4
 (Kayak app = Kayak website) Does everything the website does (and doesn't). Good app for quick travel prices and info. Don't know if I'd buy tickets on my phone though

 (Me) Awesome app!!

Version 18.0.0 4
 (Just Fine) Big Help

Version 14.0.3 5
 (Great app) Great functionality no bugs that I see... I just wish it didn't redirect you to the airlines website but other than that it's perfect

Version 18.0.0 4
 (Good app) Use this with other travel apps to get the best deal

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Awesome) I love this app. It's the best yet!!!!!

Version 11.0.0.0 1

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Great!) Useful

Version 18.0.0 5

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Best App Ever!!) I love this app!!

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Kayak Review) Love it!!! :D

Version 17.0.3 1
 (Doesn't show cheapest flights) The actual website shows the cheaper flights. The app showed flights that were $100 more. Looks like they're trying to rip the app users off to me.

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Great app) This a great app if your a person who has to travel half way across the us to see family and friends this is 4 u it's fast and they show great prices I love it

Version 14.0.5 5

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Useful!) Great app, very useful!

Version 18.0.0 4
 (would be five stars) if had weekend feature like online.

Version 18.0.0 1
 (No support for Washington DC) There is no option for District of Columbia in the "State" field when entering billing information.

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Kayak) Great app!

Version 18.0.0 5
 (This really works) The program is far more as
accurate than the SYNC I have in my 2010 Lincoln MKT. The voice is 
much more clear than the SYNC voice also.

It is very intuitive as it picks up a wrong turn and gets you back on course where SYNC keeps turning you to get on it's suggested route

Wish I could find a method to make speech louder so I could use In our 1956 Studebaker and 1990 Reatta convertible

Version 14.0.4 5

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Excellent , best way to check rates) I just do not use anything else for checking rates. I have saved an incredible amount of money. I wish I knew about it a long time ago.

Version 18.0.0 5

Version 18.0.0 5
 (As good as you may expect) Nice interface, fast, useful: what else you need?

 (Sr. Analyst) A good app. for finding deals. Although it's not tied up with all the airlines.

Version 18.0.0 4
 (Dr) It is excellent app for travelers

Version 18.0.0 3
 (Good app BUT) They ruined the flight tracker portion of the app...it maybe because of the ads, but it's WAY TOO SMALL...useless when you cannot read the information or make it larger (map view). Why even include the speed and altitude.

Version 18.0.0 4
 (Thanks) You

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Nice app) Very good and easy to use.

Version 18.0.0 5
 (Super useful and easy to use!) I <3 this app. It's easily the most convenient way to find and book flights, not to mention one of the least expensive. 
It's packed with sweet features like baggage prices for each airline, airport directories, and fare alerts- not to mention a flight tracker that tells you what the baggage claim number will be even before the plane takes off! You can even use this app to find someone with the app if you're lost in the airport. 
Yes, its awesome when AN airline offers fare alerts, but this app searches a BUNCH of airlines for the lowest possible price. 
Aside from all the cool features, this app runs smoothly, doesn't crash or stall, and looks pretty. High five to the Kayak peeps.
Conclusion: 
Totally worth the FREE cost of entry. Probably the only flight travel app you'll need.

 (Outstanding) This app puts almost every travel website to shame. I'm a spur of the moment type of person and I love being able to quickly see how much a trip to see family or friends cost. I wish it was easier to buy tickets in the app but I understand that's an airline thing rather than an app problem. (AIrlines have yet to understand that the easier it is to buy, the more you sell).

 (Truly better than the web version.) Faster, easier, and more convenient. 
Kayak in general is my go-to travel planner: they use listings across the Internet to help you plan, then you purchase directly through the provider with the cost/options you want. Then add your confirmation code, and continue planning the rest of your trip through Kayak. Probably the most intelligent Travel Organizer ever. ÓåµÓåµÓåµÓåµÓåµ

 (Quickest and most efficient) Kayak has turned into my travel app and site of choice. I actually prefer the IPad experience the best because of the map where you can just see the available low fares from around the world. Makes me want to travel more! 

The interface is intuitive and so easy to use. I definitely still check out other sites for comparison but Kayak has not  disappointed me yet!

Version 18.0.0 1

 (Best Travel App) This is the #BEST travel app EVER.
1. I get alerts regd which terminal the connecting flight leaves from. 
2. The best alert I received was regd flight cancellation that even the Airline did not bother to send. Thanks to Kayak, I had enough time to call the airline and take a different connection. 

Request: add a parking reminder and there's no need for using any airline app !!!

 (Best Travel App/Website) I travel often; about four or five times a year, and I love this app! It really helps with booking and finding flights on the go! My only suggestion is to take into account unaccompanied minors occasionally need to pay extra fees, so it would be nice to show how much that would cost for each individual airline. Otherwise, great app!

I've been on the website a few months ago but this app may be a viable replacement. However I haven't booked with Kayak yet so I'm not sure how booking hotels and flight is like. 5 stars for the ease of use of the app.

 (I love this app just.....) I love this app, just wish that it would give the actual total, not by night for hotels. Ex: 8/12-8/14 the total amount for 2 nights not just per night. I love how easy everything was to plan!!! Vegas and Denver here I come!!

Version 17.0.4 4
 (!) Love the notifications!

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Love it!!) Loved the website, loving the app more!

Version 17.0.4 4
 (Kayak is very good) This app does what it says it will do and well. Smooth interface, good clear graphics and speed, and it has become my go to for checking rates and options.

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Excellent and amazing.) Everything worked better than expected. Way easy to send a copy of e-mail flight confirmation and them be hood to go. I was surprised to not only receive check in reminders, but up to the minute flight updates about as fast as they happened. Nice to know what gate to go to and be informed of any changes or delays. Much better than the airline's app.

Version 17.0.4 4
 (Not bad) Not bad

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Excellent App!!!!) Finding all the travel needs in one go !!!

Version 17.0.4 5

 (Vagabond) Awesome use for everything

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Nice) Love it

Version 17.0.4 2
 (Great app but missing airlines) This app is excellent, except that some airlines are suspiciously absent from search results, such as JetBlue, and it  crashes pretty frequently. I expect that a bug name app like this would return fares for ALL airlines and be rock solid stable. Apparently my expectations are outlandishly high after several updates.

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Great!) Great!!!!!

Version 17.0.3 5
 (Really useful) Really helpful for all my trips :)

Version 17.0.4 4

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Sets the bar for iOS travel Apps) It's time companies take note that iPhone users do notice when they put time into their apps. This is an awesome app way easier than using kayak.com in safari. Well done Kayak.

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Love Kayak) I love Kayak.com and am pleased that the app works as smoothly as the website.

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Great!) Just what I needed and perfect for keeping on top of all my travel!

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Best airfare app I know) Very easy to use, in some aspects even better than the website.

Version 17.0.4 4
 (Love this app (w/glitches) BUT still...) Very useful for airline-ticket's price and availability checking. I wish you could book (purchase) airline tickets right from the app's result - because you have to enter same info again on your computer inorder to confirm/book. And sometimes, those low fares which you find on this app... are far gone or doesn't exist anymore :(

Version 17.0.1. 5

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Great app) Thanks to the designers for a great app with an excellent design. If I could give ten 5-star ratings, I would! The only drawback is the quality of flight status data (it would also be nice if airport codes were displayed)

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Awesome app!) There were complications with my flight and I almost had to stay at the airport overnight with no guarantee I would get a flight the next morning but I used the app to find another flight at a cheaper flight and earlier time.

Version 17.0.4 5
 (Amazing App!!!) The ability to book, search, and setup a low fare alert in one app is crazy! This is the first app that I have found that allows you to do that. Not even the major airlines and their apps allows you to do that. Not even just to simply book a flight! :( just view already purchase flight and there changes. Kayak really out did themselves on this app. I love it!

Also has lots of helpful little extras, like a guide to how much each airline charges for baggage check! Very handy to know if flight times are flexible and prices close. A reminder that the more expensive flight won't charge for baggage check can save me that much more money.

Version 17.0.4 5

I want to be able to build travel plans ( add hotels, cars, etc). And why can't I get a discount for flight and car?  There is not "what's near here" feature and no streetview. Beef this app up so I don't have to visit 4 different apps to plan my trips!!!  I'd upgrade to pro for that

Version 17.0.3 5
 (Great app) Use it to book international flights and I always get great recommendations always!!!

Version 17.0.3 4
 (Great... not perfect.) This app is very slick. Very fast and easy to use.

However, I find it annoying when planning out longer flights, as it only gives the departure date, so you kind of have to guess about when you will arrive at your destination. Asides from that, it's awesome!

Version 17.0.3 4
 (Review for the flight ticket portion) Brilliant app. At the moment 1 of my top 5. It includes lots of helpful travel tools which i havent had the chance to try yet. I have used the flight ticket tool though. Quick and easy way to check for flight price changes. I would like an easier way to purchase the tickets via app but i don't think Kayak has power over that. It would be nice if there was a landscape view for everything. So far so good!

Version 17.0.3 5

Version 17.0.3 4
 (Great apps) Very nice apps & usuful

Version 17.0.3 1

 (Great app!) Love using kayak's website and then having an app makes them even better to me! I gave it a 4 only because I haven't used all the features of it to rate it completely.

Version 17.0.3 5
 (Lch) My main usage has been the flight tracker so far. I like it because flight information is not lost when switching to another application making it easy to recheck flight status during the flight without re-entering data. It is also very easy to "Pull up" the correct airline and flight numbers.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Better than the first time!) I was excited to discover Kayak online five years ago...now it's my #1 resource for travel research and booking. I got the app just as another option for access, but after one use, i now prefer the app over online. And you will too. The user interface is so much better!

 (What?) This isn't a game!

Version 13.0.2 5
 (Best travel app) This is the most accurate, complete, and user friendly app I have seen for costing of flights, hotels, and cars. Not much more to say.

Version 17.0.3 5
 (Awesome app) My favorite feature is the integration with the website's trips feature. It allows me to forward travel itineraries emails form hotels, airlines and hotels and access them from the phone and with a single click also get flight tracking info for flights. 

...and it is great for finding low price fares that are actually available.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great app.  A++++) Helped me a lot!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Love the app) For someone always on the go.. This is the greatest app ever

 (Love) So far this app has been great with me planing trips

Version 17.0.1. 5

 (Great app) Easy To use, several kinds of search!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Lifesaver!) I'm about to embark on a series of trips & rather than have my info all over the place I can keep it all on my kayak app (even if I didn't book everything through them). Also, I know I'm gonna have to buy a last minute ticket while in transit... I can do that all in this app.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Solid) Top notch

 (I like it;)) Perfect app:)

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Great app) Easy to use and great for quick travel.

Version 17.0.1. 3
 (Solid app, but not a full port of the website.) I like the app, and find it very useful. I noticed right away however that it doesn't allow as much flexible date info as the website, and neither offer as much flexibility as the Orbitz website. Fix that and it's a five-star app.

Version 17.0.1. 5

Version 17.0.1. 5

 (Surprised how good it actually is.) Great app - as well made and useful as the safari version.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Kayak is simply The Best!) East to use, accurate price comparing.
All in one place- how did we ever manage without it?

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Fast and easy) Great way to quickly research travel costs. Each update makes the app better.

Version 17.0.1. 3
 (Great app, but kill the creepy whisper) So this is one of the must have mobile apps for travel - but seriously - must my music be turned down or shut off every time I switch screens so you can whisper "Kayak" in my ear? 

Who thought that was a good idea? Please remove it. It is annoying and slightly creepy.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great app) Makes planning trips soooooo easy, legit app!!!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great app) Very useful

Version 17.0.1. 4

 (I like it but...) It keeps crashing. I love the filters it has, but I wish it could search multiple airports.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great Flight App) I really like this Kayak app. I found flights on here for much cheaper than any of the other travel app. I also live that it sends notifications when a searched flight's price goes down. I don't know of any other one that does that.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Useful) Good aggregator of flight info.  I routinely use Kayak to find flights.

Version 17.0.1. 5

 (Love this app) Easy to use and super convenient

Version 17.0.1. 3
 (Kayak Review) Great App!! It works for all my travel needs.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Getting There) A good app buy not a great app. It should be able to build trips. For example from FLL to DCA via HOU, you should be able to test cost of direct flight or the cost of different indirect routes. Can't hold the separate routes. Someone will figure out how cost conscious travelers plan.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Kakak) Excellent site when on a budget.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Brilliant) Iv been doing research online for finding flights to and from Europe, I fly frequently. This app makes it really easy to compare. It's really fast which most flight finding websites aren't!

Version 17.0.1. 3
 (app review) it us an okay app

Version 17.0.1. 3
 (Ylm) This is truly and amazing app, BUT they have GOT to fix this crashing problem (even after reinstalling). Restarting a search that you've gotten mid-way through makes you want to...well, you can imagine.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Flights) So far all I have used is the flights but it was so easy! Better than their website.

Version 17.0.1. 4

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Favorite Travel App) Great app. Intuitive, well thought-out interface.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Not sure about new version) New version UI is less intuitive that the previous version. Maybe it will take some getting used to. Can't complain about free, though -- still overall an excellent app.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great extras!) My favorite thing about this app is all the extras like the packing list feature and airport maps!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (The best trave site!) Period.

Version 17.0.1. 5

Version 17.0.1. 5

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Best price) They get u the best price in the market

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great app) Is the best app in his kind

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (The only travel app you will ever need) They did a great job with this app...I am really surprised that none of the big $ airline companies such as Delta are not capable of building a customer centric app...

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Super-easy & quick!) Kayak on the iPhone is the quickest, easiest way to search flights. It seems it's quicker even than Kayak.com. And kudos to the UX designer in this. Great interface. I love this app!

 (Awesome) Helpful app!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great!) So easy to use.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Great App So Far) I've only used this app a bit but find it easy to use and helpful. 
My only complaint is that when sorting hotel results by price I need to pick 'cheap' or 'classy'
Since I'm always looking for a good price I fall into the 'cheap' category. I'd rather search by price 'low to high' then call myself 'cheap' LOL!

Version 17.0.1. 5

 (Awesome) I didn't realize that Kayak is such a great app and even trip planner! Amazing!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Very useful) Even if you don't use it to buy tickets, it is an awesome itinerary app.  Just forward the itinerary email to them and all details are sorted including maps.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Love it) I use the kayak app every day, just to browse for flights. Kayak is always the cheapest!

Version 17.0.1. 3
 (Love it, BUT) When you did the last update one of my favorite feature disappeared. As far as I can tell, there is no way to create a "zone" to search inside on the map. Example: I used to be able to circle an area on the map and search for a hotel inside it. Not anymore. Give it back and the rating will go up for me.

Version 17.0.1. 3
 (Great app, but alerts need work) Love the app itself, but wish I could have the alert tell me when the price drops throughout the day.  I find that according to kayak's own price graph, I'm missing the lowest fares of the day. Needs some work!!!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Perfect!) This app is easy to use and a must have for travelers.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Amazing!) Love it!

Version 17.0.1. 5

Version 17.0.1. 4

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (4) Would give it a 5 if it had a way of seeing vacation packages like there web site.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Easy to use) It's a good app, pretty helpful and best of all, free.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Amazing!) New version rocks!

Version 17.0.1. 2
 (Nags for review 2nd open) Isn't that dumb?

How would I be able to review it properly?

So there ya go.

Version 17.0.1. 1
 (New flight UI is horrible!) This used to be a great app until the newest release. Now there is no way to reverse airports. No way to view current results. No way to choose non-stop preference. No way to see the entire selected airport name. Why did you take these options away?  Filters used to be nice an easy to use. Not anymore. Please return this app to the great app it was before.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Too good to be free.) Honestly this app has quality and convenience of a good $5 app. It's so easy to use and the update made it even better. It's incredibly useful and helpful. I usually don't write reviews but that Kayak app is that good. I recommend it to anyone doing ANY kind of travel. It will literally save you time and money. Oh did I mention it's FREE. Get it.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Great) I'm giving four stars because I have not used it enough for five stars. So far, easy to navigate and great user interface. 
They are keeping up their good reputation with this app

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (The best thing around) Easy and very accurate...

 (Awesome) This app is awesome. Simple to use. Easy to find flights. I'm gonna use this to plan all of my travel this year.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Better than web versiob) No ads

Version 17.0.1. 1
 (Disaster new  version) The new launched this January 2011 is a disaster!! Before one was able to select non-stop flight before making the search, now one has to make the search and then filter results. Selecting today's date on flight search was just a click, now is not possible.... Changing the city/airport direction of the flights was just one click to make reverse round-trip searches now not possible. Longer time for searches.... Will have to move to another provider!! :(

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Best Travel App ever!) The app is next to none, love it!

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Love it - slick) The only drawback is sometimes it lacks the cheapest flights within Europe.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Awsome tool) Love it how I can compare different sites in one app

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Good price and easy to use) I travel a lot, it did a good job to remind me of the price drop! Help me save $400! Recommend!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (#1 Travel App) Great way to stay organized. Keeps all my travel plans in one place and a ton of information about the airlines, airports, hotels, and travel locations.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Time of Day Search) No place to search AM or PM flights.

Version 17.0.1. 5

 (Ok) Does it all

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (The BEST travel app!) The features and tools in this app offer just about every imaginable combination or routes.  Sort by price, airline, exact or flexible dates.  This app is comparable to a program I use to book corporate travel for a major company!!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great App) Great app.  Does a nice job finding good prices.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Kayak) Best travel app out there! Blows orbitz and expedia out of the water!

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Great travel app!!!!!) Very easy to use, works great!!!!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (The best) A must have. The best travel app.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Fab) The best travel app out there!  And, a great development team: I found a bug and I got a personal thanks from the team for reporting and it was fixed and released ASAP!  Plus: the scary surprise "kayak" voice had me laughing. (see if you can find it!)

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Best app) Simple, fast, and complete!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Good app) A must for the traveler on the go

 (Convenient!) All the features of the website in an app.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Nurse pro) Excellent√®!!!!

Version 17.0.0. 2
 (It used to be good) They have changed the format.  I hate it now.  It used to be perfect, but now is clumsy to use.  I'm getting tired of these updates changing the functionality of the apps.  Pageonce messed up the personal asst app too.  Quit fiddle farting around with these things when they are good.  Or at least give us the option to use an older version.  Leave the old version in the app store too and let people choose.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Best travel app) Great app!! Allows you to email your itineraries (for flights, hotels, cars booked on any site) and access them all in one place. For all it does, I can't believe it's free!!!

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Great app!  With only one complaint) I wish I could access other people's trips, those that I can see online because I've been given access. Other than that, it's an awesome app with great information so readily available!  Thanks Kayak!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great little app!) What with all the crap going on with airlines these days... It's good to know we can still go with KAYAK to help us find the best deals in town... And... It's easy to use and we'll always know the results will be accurate!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Grrrrrrrrreat!) The notifications are the best for keeping track of lowering prices.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Easy to use) It's easy to use, great way to see the lowest price from all sites in one place. User friendly.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Haha) Nice thing to have

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Very usable) Not an average junk.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Better than a web page) This app is definitely easier to use tuan a regular web page.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Best one place stop) This to me is the best place to stop and search all the sites for the best prices. A must have app

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Good) Good

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Kayak) It's all I use

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Do not pass go!) Best travel app on the market. I have been using for years.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (It does what it claims to do!) This app replaced all of my other travel apps. It does everything I need it to do and all that it says it does.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Excellent app!!!!) Download it!

Version 17.0.1. 1
 (Same or higher flight rates!) There are much better offers for European flights which can be found directly from European airlines.  Be ware, the rates showing are not the final rates, you might end up paying hundreds more ... Gas tax, airport tax, etc.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Well thought out) Excellent app. When searching for flights though, I would like the refinements I made to not cancel when I change dates.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Outstanding) This app has everything I could ever need while traveling abroad. I cannot think of anything that this app is wanting. And plus the only difference between the free and paid versions is the ads! I see no reason not to get this app if you do any amount of traveling.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Muy completa) Con varias opciones y muy practica felicidades!!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Luv it, really kool) Really like this app

Version 17.0.0. 4
 („Åô„Åî„ÅÑÔºÅ) Very useful for looking up flights frequently to see how prices fluctuate. Helps get tickets at a cheaper price.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Very handy app) Very useful for someone traveling without fixed plans

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (HERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENT IDEAS) 1. Integrate frequent flyers programs or at least have a "wallet" to store all that info...

2. I lovey trips... I haven't yet tested but I hope it works offline so that once it's downloaded to the phone it stays there so even if I don't have an Internet connection I can see it.

3. Free wifi finder in airports... Allow people to post where wifi is available in various airports including passwords if necessary.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Great app!!) Awsome app great reasearch!!

Version 17.0.1. 3
 (Good App) It's good to be able to find the cheapest flight and hotel in one place.  And this app does just that.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great) Excellent!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (So easy and fast!) This app is exactly what the cheap flights world needed!

Version 17.0.1. 4

 (Very good!) Easy to use.  Very pleased.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Recommend!) Great travel App

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Awesome) Good job Kayak!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (One stop shop!) This app is a must have for travelers! It has everything from booking flights, car rentals, hotels to providing a packing check list! If you are a frequent traveler you need this app! It's a one stop shop! I give it a 5 star rating based on features and convenience.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Good app) Not a bad app does what it says

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Best around) Nothing beats kayak. Wish SWA would cave and let kayak post their fares. What used to set SW apart is now common and they haven't invested in innovation.

Version 17.0.1. 2
 (Crash crash crash!!!) I love this app. No other travel app is as easy or helpful. However recent updates have made it impossible to use. It crashes frequently. I can't finish booking on my mobile because it crashes so much. I tried re-download and reboot, it still crashes. Fix this Kayak!!!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Great app) Great app I love using it!!

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Best travel app) This is the best travel free travel app

Version 17.0.0. 5

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Gtreat) You need this app! Trust me on this

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Love it!) I love the ease and use of the app just like the online version. I especially love the fact that I can book my daughter's ticket from Europe to the U.S.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Traveler) Great app!! Great deals. Easy to use.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Warlins raitong) This is an amazing app and i like it and it helps you out a lot

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (The only game in town) Although I'm a big fan of kayak.com, there are other travel sites that are just as good if not better (cFares.com comes to mind). But this app and the Bing app are pretty much it for mobile travel apps. It's a very good app, pretty close to the full website. Recommend.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Great app!) Only wish I knew earlier

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (I think of you) Kayak app is something I dream of when my iPhone is plugged in,  and out of reach, kayak is what makes my life shine, like a diamond! I think of you, I think of you.

Version 17.0.1. 4
 (Great App) Very convenient

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (The best of its kind. Perfect !!!) This is it !! I cant believe how well this app works. Its the best of ita kind. Never have ro use anything else. Easy to use anf search and filter and book. Thank yoi Kayak !!  Jem

Version 17.0.1. 2
 (A step backwards) Don't care for new interface. Not as intuitive as before. More screens to go thru. This used to be my favorite travel app...not any more.

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (Useful app) Simple, fast, powerful. What else is needed?

Version 17.0.1. 5
 (The best tool for your trip) If you are a business man or woman and you want have the best options in your trip, this is the perfect tool to plan it.

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Great app!!) I would make this a 5 star app if it had all airlines. I fly alot with southwest and jetblue and those two are not on the list. Other then that its still a great app! I love this app!!!!

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (iOS 3.2??) so, people with 3.2 just lost their money? Since the latest version its just for 4

Version 17.0.0. 2
 (Unsatisfying Revision) The latest version seems a step back in usability, the prior interface was more user- friendly, simpler and quite effective IMO. Now one has to go through more menu steps to get the information wanted, and a few of the filters have become confusing (where is "uncheck all" in the search per hotel brand, for instance?). Content still some of the best, presentation botched.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Love.) Very easy to research flights and love the ability to get price alerts. One of the best free apps I've ever downloaded. Thanks.

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (Worthless) All the flight dates & tines don't match what I put in for search. Everything is mixed up & mis matched. I'll give it another week, and I'm done. Fix it & I'll fix my review.

Version 17.0.0. 3
 (Crashes) When I'm looking at a preview for a Hotel and I start looking at the photos the app crashes and just closes down on me

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Helpful) This app helps me to get things done more efficiently.
Nice and considerate tool.

Version 17.0.0. 3
 (Crashes) Great app but keeps crashing on me!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great job!!) You guys have done an amazing job withthis and the iPad a

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (got to have it !) great app !

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Fantastic! Innovative and usable!) Kayaks designers care about the customer experience!

Version 17.0.0. 2
 (Crashes) Crashes when adding new custom packing list.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Excellent) I love tracking the flight in a map

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (2 thumbs up) Easy access and very convenient !

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Flyby) Simply the best out there. You just forward you reservation conformation email and it organize everything for you in your trips profile. Love it.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (EZ Kayak) Love this app - super convenient and easy to use!

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Go kayak) Kayak makes orbits look bad because kayak is there when u need it.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (AWESOME APP) Can't believe this is FREE! This is an awesome app.

Version 17.0.0. 2
 (Wamp wamp...) Usually don't get involved in review writing, but please don't let your ego get in the way of changing this app back it's previous design. The previous graphical design was way better. The line press is played out and over utilized by iOS developers.  The orange boxes are much funner, intuitive and easier to read. Thanks, looking forward to updating my review very soon.

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (.) I think the App is great! I've had some problems changing the date also but I've found that if you hold down on the date and drag it it will change. This could be Easily fixed in the next update! Thank You!

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (This is a great app!) This app is easy to us and reliable!

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Great travel app!!!) All in one best travel app yet!!!,

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (feature) can you added mileage plan storage feature

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Simple money saver) Actually very easy to use app.  This is how you would expect to purchase inexpensive flights on the iPhone!

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Good app) It is so accurate

Version 17.0.0. 3
 (Very easy to use, but...) It crashes when I try to view flight details.

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (Bug: can't change the date of travel.) I am unable to select/change the date of travel, which renders this app totally useless. I have the latest version of the app.

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (Bring back the previous version.) The updated version ruined a great app. The previous version looked better and was easier to navigate. I wish I had not updated :(

Version 17.0.0. 3
 (Waaaa :() Loved the matrix in the old version.  Did the most perfect travel app need a new version?  Waaaaa :(

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Gotta get it) Super user-friendly!

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (Don't update!) The last update is horrible, I used to love kayak but they took the flight times away from the initial results making the app useless.

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Great) I can just get a vacation idea and check for the best deal, best time at the comfort of my couch, knowing I'll be able to find it here. That is very important. I love this app.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (New UI is great) I generally only use the flight search features.  The improved UI is excellent -- looks great, intuitive, and gets pretty much all of the website's features in touch-friendly display.  Actually, I think I prefer the iPhone app to their main website now.

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Most useful app ever) My job requires alot of last minute travel. Kayak is the best resource. Hate the latest update though. Wish they left it awesome.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Great Site!) It's nice to use a site that's objective and gives you so many options.

Version 17.0.0. 2
 (Fast, but at what cost?) Can no longer narrow search results by departure and arrival times among numerous other factors that made the previous version and full site Kayak truly useful.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (great design) I am really impressed! The UI is easy to use and very attractive. Bold and modern without sacrificing usability.

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Saved time and money using this app.) Great app for looking for travel deals on the go.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great app) This is one of the best app's especially if you fly a lot!

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (One of my favorite apps!) Kayak.com is great and with the latest app update all the features I need from the website are on the phone. UI changes are generally cool although I miss the flipping animation from the main menu to the various views. Keep up the good work guys and gals!

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (Wish I hadn't updated) New UI is poor experience. The old calendar was the best of any iPhone app. Now i have to touch that tiny arrow with my fat fingers like all the other apps. What happened to the easy-to-interpret homepage? Now I have to scroll on a homepage? Switching back to Bing Travel.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Wonderful) Does everything it's supposed to! Works great ;)

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Awesome app!) Thank you very much!!! Very useful!!!

Version 17.0.0. 2
 (I hate to rain on your parade...) Becuz it is (was) a great app. But i liked the older interface. It was very basic and not too busy looking. This one has too much going on design wise. Travelers are stressed enough as it is. 

Oh and we want the calendar search option!!!

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Excelen) Buena y facil de usar

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Great app!!) Great app!!

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (Ya Broke It) New version shows wrong detailed flight results after selecting a flight from the results listing. This bug makes the app unusable. 

Please do better testing before you take a perfectly working version away from us. 

How can we revert to the previous version while waiting for you to fix this one?

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Excellent source) I really recommend this app!!!

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Bringing it all together) This app does a great job of bring a lot of information together in one place. Great!

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Very Useful) Good app!

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Kayak) Great app, when it is actually running correctly, can't stand that it keeps booting me off -_-

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (The Old Version Was MUCH Better) Kayak is, hands down, the best travel website and app available. However, this new version of the iPhone app ruined a good thing.

User interface ultimately comes down to taste, and personally, I think this new UI is ugly and doesn't compare to the old UI.

I also noticed that in this new version, the 'map' feature is no longer available when searching for a hotel. It was one of the best features! Please bring it back.

To reiterate, I love the website, but hate the new app redesign.

Version 17.0.0. 3
 (UI..not so purty) Bring back the 'tiles' please..update those if u have to. This interface and the lack of interactive hotel map is not great at all.

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (So mad I updated. Hate the new interface) Old version was way better.

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (Not working) Did anyone test this before the new release? Flight does not allow me to change the date. It keeps the last day I searched for flights, which was last month, so completely useless.

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (I liked the old UI...) Why not have an option to switch UIs? Still great app though.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Great app) Makes life easier

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (The new UI is good-ish) I liked the old home screen with the tiles. But I do like everything else better.

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (Stay away from v17) They removed interactive hotel map

Version 17.0.0. 3
 (Great as a pocket app!) Love tha options in search and great to have this as an app!

Version 17.0.0. 1
 (Crash happy) App crashed as soon as I opened it & also when I do a search. They also don't show delta flights anymore so the app is useless to me. I will be deleting.

Version 17.0.0. 2
 (Bug new version) The timing (take off and landing) doesn't match when you expand the itinerary to full details. Pls fix. Not acceptable. The rest UI is cool!

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Good Ui) Your ' Kayak' sound scares me..... When I opened it, a female voice ' kayak ' came out of iPhone..... Lol

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Great App for the Price!) Easy to use. Well designed any many useful features.

Version 14.0.5 1
 (Azul airline flight data missing in Flights) Please, add Azul flight data in Flights.   Azul airline is an important option from Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo to many other cities in Brazil.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great for on the go) This is perfect for on the go travel. It is organized nicely and they way you can refine your search results is perfect. Highly suggested to anyone who frequently travels.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Great app!) It's a really good travel app- it doesn't do flight+hotel like on the computer but generally easy and fun to use.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Great) It's good!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Love it, get it now!!) Love, love, love this app. Great tools for travelers. Checklist, hotels, itinerary, flight alerts...
Would give it 5 stars if price alerts were a bit better.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Best travel app out there!) Hands down, amazing app. Most have!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Super useful) Fare alerts are awesome, charts are great!

UI could use some more polish.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Great app) Very useful app- has a lot of features that you may not expect. Setting up fare alerts very useful. Flight tracking, beacon, packing list, currency converter all make this a better program than I had initially realized.  And free.

Version 14.0.5 1
 (Wrong pricing) Beware the prices I got from Kayak app for a flight out of Tampa to Singapore was $13,000. Same itinerary through other websites were $1,300.   Great app if you willing to pay 10x more. Used kayak 5 months ago for my trips. Not anymore,how can I trust this app.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Love this app!) I use the site all the time. Having the convenience of their search engine in a mobile app, with all it's flexibility and filters is great.

Version 14.0.5 3
 (Cool) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!get this app called (checkpoints)it gives you free money or an ipod and even a wii register with the bounes code (enndy) and you can get a free 25$ gift card from itunes!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! Or a gamestop gift card of 50$ but remember enndy is the bounes code enndy enndy enndy enndy.  Ok its (enndy) E N N D Y oooh and why am i doing this its becuase for every person i get to register with my code gives me points to get more things thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (User friendly) Better than priceline, expedia apps...easier to use and gives you what you need.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Love it) It's nice being able to track a flight.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Brilliant) Kayak is a awesome app for organizing trips. Flights are twice as expensive as it shows on the app because the price on the app is the price without taxes.

Version 14.0.5 1
 (Rates are Not Accurate (almost double)) Sat you search and you get great prices, but when you get to book, it becomes almost double the price they originally showed.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Nice app...fmtpo) Makes searching for deals fun and exciting. My Favorite Friday Night Activity!!!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Quite helpful! Kayak always is.) Thanks!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great app) Makes you want to go some where every time I start this app.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great App) Very handy and intuitive.

Version 14.0.5 3
 (Pricing.) App has a great UI. Easy to use. But the app usually shows prices MUCH higher than what displayed on the web. Not accurate and needs an update. 

Ex. On App from SMF to CLT today! is $1300. 
On the web it's 290.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Practically PERFECT!!!) Kayak really stepped up to the plate with this sensational app.  The only thing I would love is a little better integration of the Trips section so that you wouldn't need to go to the Kayak website to set up iCal calendar alerts. Also, it would be great if you could book hostels instead of just hotels.

But these are fairly minor points in comparison to all the things that they did incredibly well in this app.

Thank you, Kayak!!!

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Great travel tool) I've been using this tool since I discovered it a couple years ago. Such a helpful time saver. Love the pricing tool for flexible travel dates.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (A decent app) I love the Kayak site/app, but the iPhone app doesn't go the extra mile.  It would be nice if it had more intuitive features (like, it knows when I'm traveling, show my flight status automatically, don't make me click for it!)

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Best travel app) Best travel app I've used to date - great interface!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Love this app) I use this constantly and it is the best traveling tool because you always get the cheapest flight and only have to check one place. Love love love

Version 14.0.5 5
 (All In One!) Hotel rates, flight fares, landing schedules, and lots more
 functionalities packed into one great app! The interface is beautiful and elegant! Can't believe it's free! Thanks!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (great app, tons of functionality!!) great app, great interface, easy to use and has a ton of "extras" that save you from having to download 3 other apps to do the same things!

Version 14.0.5 3
 (It's alright) It works well to look up specific dates and destinations but I really want an app that will show me the last minute cheap getaways. I want to know about that $39 ticket to Vegas!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Pretty good) Initially, I thought a kayak app would be unnecessary- why would I need to shop for flights on the go, when I could wait to do it at home. However, I've found it's great to have the info at your fingertips.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great) Great

Version 14.0.5 1
 (Do Not get latest update!!!!) This app was the best until I updated and now you can't search by dates.  They make you pick an airline.  How ridiculous and a waste of time!!!!!!!!!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Great app!) Has everything you could need to plan your travel!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (5) 5stars

Version 14.0.5 5
 (B) Outstanding App! Simple and effective to use.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Checkpoints) This is great, but the best app is checkpoints! Download it to get iTunes gift cards just for doing normal stuff. Use referral code: NoTrace1 for a free 300 points just for signing up!
NoTrace1

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Useful) Haven't booked anything off of it yet. But looks pretty good

Version 14.0.5 5
 (This is awesome) Best user interface of its kind,
Best research tool of its kind,
Best beating price of its kind,
Best traveling management of its kind!
Forget about others' like tripit/priceline. This one beat them all

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Great app) very useful for traveling

Version 14.0.3 5
 (Great app) Easy to use.  Does everything you could want.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Investor) This is a cool great app. Checking my travel flight status is terrific, it works. I already recommended it to several of my facebook friends and others, and it's FREE ,,,,,

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Such a great and easy app to use!) I love this app! So easy to use. I sent my flight itinerary AND hotel reservations and it put it all into a trip for me. Very helpful and easy to use

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Easy to use) This is the easiest full functional travel app.

Version 14.0.5 2
 (so far so good) just got app last night due to tracking my flight today due to northeast blizzard conditions. i'll probably make a review when i use it some more. 

what did happen is the flight tracker didn't update at all from yesterday. luckily my flight is ontime

Version 14.0.5 2
 (Leaves You Sitting & Waiting) Never updates flight delays, and does not add itineraries.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Sooo useful and free!!!) This app is just brilliant and useful...
I strongly recommend it to everyone...
Every iPhone must have it!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (I never write reviews but...) This app is so amazing. I needed to book a flight after a missed flight and kayak helped me find the cheapest, quickest, best way to get to my destination. It was even better than the airlines. Download this app especially if you're in a tough spot and need a flight.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Literally search one, then done) I LoVE kayak! It's the best travel/ airfare search engine!!!! THANK YOU

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Awesome) I love this app

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Near perfection) Needs vacation search. I see there's a spot on he first screen. ;-)
Excellent app.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Kayak Review!) I love this app! I live in Alaska and plane tickets are always super expensive. This app helps me find the best prices!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great app) I like this app does wut describe to do! Ps its multi search is my favorite !

Version 14.0.2 1
 (Website is ok.  The app is bad) The app is very bad. It Will work maybe 1 out of 20 times.  The website is better, but getting worse as it has gotten more popular.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Perfect) Perfect application

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Kayak) Finds the cheapest rates.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Nice) Best travailing app ever

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Kayak rocks) Saved us $$$ during recent trip to LA when I had comventiently forgotten to book a rental car.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (A Good service) Travel aggregator better than most

Version 14.0.5 2
 (Crashes) Crashes very often in new ipod

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Great site for last minute trips!) Easy to use; makes travel planning easy.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Amazing app) Great app, very convenient, has most of the website features.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Kayak has proved it again) it's an excellent app from the people who provided us the google of 'travel'.The coolest thing about this app is tgat it keeps almost the same uniformity & consistency just like the desktop version.It'll be great if they add vacation package deals from multiple sources too.keep up the good work guys

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Nice!) I don't travel than often, but it helped me to tell my friend and myself a couple of times what is the range of prices that they should expect.
Nice App!!!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Cool app) Nice interface, awesome features, very quick. I now have everything I need for travel including phone numbers of all airlines. And last but not least, this app is FREE. 
Too bad this app can't make me coffee :)

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Good!) Lol textfree got me here

Version 14.0.5 2
 (Very similar to other apps of this nature) Same old stuff

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Yay! Free Warbucks!!!) I'm more of a gamer than a deal junkie, so I'm always on the lookout for free game-boosting apps!
True, while I do see the benefits of using this app to find cheap hotels, good flights, and roadtrip planners, I must confess that I downloaded this app for 
a completely different reason!  I'm not sure I'll ever use it for anything, but I got 4 free "warbucks" to spend in the "Gun Bros." game app.  
Most apps only give you one or two "warbucks," but this one gives you four!  Thanks guys!   This app gets five stars!!!
p.s.  add "Spartan S-117" to your friends list on Game Center.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Cool) Perfect

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Kayak) excellent app I love kayak all year round. what else I can ask!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Rdggheak) Tried this alongside TripCase, and think I will switch to Kayak. I like the fact that I can both plan new trips and track existing ones in one place. Kayak imported an Amtrak reservation that TripCase could not. Kayak is also better at tracking status of flights that are not in your own itinerary. I also like the calendar subscription feature - very useful. All in all a great travel toolbox.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Helped me get good deal a few times) It's probably saved me a few hundred bucks over the past year or two. Cool features, user friendly interface.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Pefect app for travel) Has all the info i need n its FREE

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Nice app) Very nice app. I love it!!!!!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great) It's awesome 
Very useful and helpful 
Important info that I need

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great tool on the go) This is a very handy app I downloaded it about 6 months ago and been using it since. I use it most to look for flights and they're always the cheapest.

Version 14.0.5 3
 (Not too bad) Good

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Gcccvv) Great!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Good) It keeps things orderly

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great) Use it 2x a week at least

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great app) This app is fantastic. It has a lot of search controls to hone in on the right flight at the right price.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Awesome) Awesome app. Period.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Awesome) Awesome!!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Great app.) I've tried and deleted most all other travel related apps. This is the best of the non-airline sponsored apps out there. Look no further.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (The best) You are the best ÓÄé

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Saved us when the airlines failed) We got a text message and email from Kayak this morning alerting us thy our flight had been cancelled. Our airline would have flown us to our first connection then left us stranded overnight. Why can Kayak, a free service, contact people easily but an airline who charged us $2000 can't manage it? 

Plus, great interface, good website, fun to use. And free! A winner.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Grea app) Great app. The best of all around travel apps

Version 14.0.4 2
 (Mixed Efficiency) Kayak, as a way to buy tickets works well only when you are buying from Kayak. The payment interface in this case is good. But if you get directed off site, for example to Orbitz, the process is inefficient, the screens are too small for all the info entry, and if you make a mistake, you start again from scratch.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Love the Kayak app!) I use it frequently, love this app!!! Not as comprehensive as the web version, but still fantastic!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Very good app does what it suppose to) Recommend

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Always good) You always find the best options

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Awesome app! I use it all the time.) G

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Awsome) Very good app especially the flight state. I am using it all the time to know the prizes.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Sensacional) Bom layout, pr√°tico e funciona! 

Poderia ter os pre√ßos dos v√¥os em real.

Vale a pena, tem muito para crescer.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Comes in handy) Great app

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great app!) Easy to use, makes travelling ultra easy

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Better than TripIt) Great app for tracking trip details like flight info, flight status, gate changes, hotel reservation, rental car reservation, and train reservation details. I never need to print out a confirmation email again because Kayak aggregates all of this info in one spot. The ability to find additional flights, hotels, etc. is a bonus too.

Version 17.0.0. 4
 (Best travel app) Nice interface, great features. Crashes on occasion but very rarely.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Outstanding design) I rarely write reviews of apps unless I find them either really bad or simply outstanding. The Kayak app is definitely the later. This is a true one-stop app for travellers. I'm so impressed with the breadth of it's offerings, it's easy navigation and over all design. Great job!

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Impressive) I was using Tripit, but you might be better. I love the packing lists. Really one stop shopping when it comes to travel.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Awesome app!) Great! A must have app!

Version 17.0.0. 3
 (Crashes.) Sloths updates for phone and app are current. Everytime I check for flight status, it closes app. Search is good except it doesnt save last search location

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Fast and accurate.) I live this app. Does exactly what you expect.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Great app) Works great. Used several times. Great details and hotel pics. Makes it easier to find a place to stay!!!

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Good app for checking pricing) Could use a few minor tweaks but great app.

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Great app) Amazing hotel finding app. Easily best one I've used yet. Just as good as using a normal computer and search through full websites.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Kayak) Good job, kayak! Easy to use, simple; flawless.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Kayak) Logical and intuitive interface, quick and responsive, exceeds expectations

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Great travel app) Easy to use, lots of trip alerts & options.

Version 14.0.5 4
 (Handy to have at times) A good app when I'm on the road. But I've not booked from it yet.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Couldn't live without this) Best fares from your fingertips!!! Thank you Kayak!!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (I like i!) Easy to use and convenient.

Version 14.0.5 5
 (Kayak) Great App!

Version 17.0.0. 5
 (Great!) Better than web version!

Version 14.0.5 5
 (I love kayak!) Kayak.com is the best place to shop for plane tickets, and their app is just as wonderful!

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Great) Love this app- easy and fun to navigate!

Version 14.0.4 5
 (My favorite app for travel) Hands down, this app is probably one of the best travel companion app out there...  I replaced the dependable USAToday travel app with this one.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Best travel app) Quick, easy to use, best travel app there is.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Luv it) Great - it's my go to travel app.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Ok) This one works!  Lots don't.  Use this one.

Version 14.0.4 4
 (Great!) I like all the features. Well designed. User friendly. Kudos to kayak.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Great travel app.) I love using this app for checking updates on flight prices. It has served me well in all my travels arrangements.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (easy) fast, easy, free. way easier than using the actual websites.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (This app saves my life) Quick and dirty 
I think its better than the website:)

Version 14.0.4 4
 (Holds up) Really holds up to the web page. Very helpful.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Best app in Travel!) Best app in Travel!

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Attorney) This app is every bit as functional as the browser-based one. I completed a purchase started with Kayak Mobile and zero problems.  Getting to keep various routes and days helped immensely in trip planning. 
Great job!!!

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Love it!!!!) Love it!

Version 14.0.4 4
 (Just what you need) Great for tracking down the best prices for spur of the moment travel.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (As essential for travel as a suitcase) Utterly perfect travel utility that is better on iPhone and iPad than it is on a computer.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Fantastic app.) Unbelievably useful app.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Excellent) 100% useful

Version 14.0.4 5
 (So cool) This app is really good and helpful, thank to all who create it, and I want more and more.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Great app..) This app is very useful.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Very good) Useful site

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Great app) Works as advertised.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Excellent) Great apps

Version 14.0.4 5
 (WOW!) It does it all, I like the checklist functionality.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Awesome!) Great app, really impressive functionality!

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Great app!

Version 14.0.4 2
 (Horrible prices) The prices you get on the app are not consistent with the prices on kayak's main site! Having to check the website on a desktop machine makes this app superfluous. The prices on here are high by several hundred dollars and are basically a tax on the lazy and those without access to a computer.

Version 14.0.4 4
 (Good) I like it

Version 14.0.0 5
 (The best travel app) Incredible app. It's only gotten better and better!

PS. Check out kayak.com/explore....literally my favorite website.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Easy to use) Very handy for multiple city itinerary.

Version 14.0.4 1
 (Very disappointed) I used kayak for the first time today. When checking the status of my AirTran Flight it kept saying it was on time yet the flight was delayed by 3 hours. Out of curiosity I checked much later that evening and the app showed an on time delivery. Again...we landed 3 hours late. How can I rely on the app?

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Super useful) Logging in to add my upcoming flight details. Will tell me my flight status and what terminal to tell the cabbie. I use this app for wert flight.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Best) Es lo mejor q hay esta bien detallada

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Great app) Great app but still needs more updates to be like the website. Good job with kayak :)

Version 14.0.4 4
 (Good) Good app. But need more sources

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Good app) Great app!

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Great!) Like it!

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Better than the website) Better than the website in every way.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Great app!) Awesome app. Way better than tripit. I would really like the ability to share my itineraries with family and friends who don't have a Kayak login. And is that link only viewable on mobile devices?

Version 14.0.4 3
 (Kayak) Very useful app.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Wow) Fantastic app. Looks great works better.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (For anyone doing any international travel this is a must) .

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Nice App!!) Really cool app. Good user interface, flexible options and you can set fare alerts for email, push notification or both. It even links you to the carrier websites to buy. And it's free!

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Very nice) But can't choose flexible date!

Version 14.0.4 4
 (Newcommer30) Great for travel

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Love it) Functional.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (I use this app all the time for buying flights) I wear out travel sites, but this one is the best by far for int'l and domestic trips.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Love it) Easy to use and it gives lots of options

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Twinsister) Can't complain, this app is great. Does everything it is intended to do.

Version 14.0.4 4
 (Thankful I downloaded this app!!) I was able to quickly and effectively search for a flight that was very reasonable!! This year I moved away from my family so I'll be back and forth from NY to Detroit alot, this app will come in handy! Thanks Kayak!

Version 14.0.4 1
 (Doesn't cover most international airports) I fly international and this App is limited to domestic airports only.

Version 14.0.4 4
 (Useful travel research tool) I'd seen the commercials, but didn't really know what this was. Since it was a free app I decided to DL it and check it out. I discovered it really has a lot of useful tools to help plan your trip. It kind of is a one-stop-shopping place. I like how it has a lot of info built into the app and what it doesn't already list, it has links links directly to a travel company websites for more details. I haven't tried booking a reservation through Kayak yet., bit I need to find a hotel room for a trip next month so we'll how that works out. This app is definitely worth the download!

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Fantastic travel app!) This app is incredible. I only installed this app to earn free points on MegaJump. It turns out that this app is really useful. I used this app to book hotel rooms for bargain basement prices. You can sort your searches by location, cheapest, classy, and others. It would be nice to add a feature that would couple a few qualifiers such as closest cheap hotels. But all in all I give five stars! Very useful.

Version 14.0.4 5
 (The best) So helpful

Version 14.0.3 4
 (Useful app) Really good app to find nice deals  !!

Version 14.0.4 3
 (O.K) Pretty helpful

Version 14.0.4 5
 (Cool) This is realy helpful

Version 14.0.3 4
 (Pretty good...) Good app that will provide you with some quick and cheap pricing. The best part is when you send the application referral e-mail to any of your contacts... Download it and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Overall Very Good, but) I would give this app 5 stars, but in order to do so it would need Amtrak fares as well.

Version 14.0.3 4
 (Great App!!) A great app for travelers. Has everything you need to plan and while on the go. Easy to use interface. Would have given 5 stars but was missing the St. Louis Airport which is a major airport compared to some listed. PLEASE ADD IT IN NEXT UPDATE!!

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Great app!) I use it every day! Great, great, great app!!!

Version 14.0.3 1
 (Version for  IOS 4.2 crashes on iPod Touch) New version for IOS4.2 crashes 100% of the time when using cool new flight status feature and alerts. Can I revert to old version?

Version 14.0.3 5
 (Ssk) Great app. Very easy to use. Interface is very user friendly.  All the options a traveler needs are included in this app. Best way to search hotels.

Version 14.0.3 5
 (Cool) Not cool

Version 14.0.3 5
 (updated!) I have L0VED! This App ever since it came out.. the updates are sweet!

Version 14.0.3 5
 (AMAZING) I love this app it has saved me a couple times and always finds great deals

Version 14.0.3 5
 (Very useful app) It's a very useful app.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (For Traveling Professionals: an essential) The Kayak application is definitely the most powerful and thorough flight search application I have ever used. When combined with the unique features of the iPhone interface, and real-time search updating with intuitive search modifications for people with most any need, be it time or price or airport options, airline restrictions and more, it just doesnt get any better than this. 

Personally, I am in a place in life right now where I am traveling almost constantly and I can't put this app down. When combined with the southwest, priceline, flight update and weather app, you really have a powerhouse travel agency at your fingertips.

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Best Travel app I've used) Great customization and simple. Found the best rate on this immediately. Wasted hours of research after I already found the best rate on here. So it proved to find the best flight for me. Win

Version 14.0.3 2
 (Nice app) It's a nice app but the trip feature does not work. Even though a trip is added to my account and I can see it online, the app won't show the trip. Otherwise awesome app.

Version 14.0.3 1
 (Junk) Even after restarting the phone, it just crashes when you touch Flight Status. Doesn't anyone test these apps?

Version 14.0.3 5
 (A powerful tool for travelers) Very useful while planning the travel and during the journey as well.

Version 14.0.3 5
 (GOOD) Just a great app.

Version 14.0.3 5
 (Excellent travel planning tool) It is fast and gives all the options. Available with great ease of use

Version 14.0.3 2
 (OMG this is annoying!) I am trying to check my Aunt's flight status but whenever I type in all the information on "Flight Status" it just x's me off the app! I have tryed 4 times and it hasn't worked ANY time!

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Wonderful and versatile!) It has many many options! One of my favorites is the packing checklist!

Version 14.0.3 4
 (The new 14.x update is outstanding!) A huge congrats to the development team on an excellent application. Like its web-based big brother, it is intuitive, easy to use, full featured, fast and just pleasant to look at and interact. Great job Kayak!

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Simply wonderful!) Thank you!

Version 14.0.2 3
 (great!) Really like this app

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Fabulous fabulous fabulous) Love this app. Super easy to use, and in my opinion, easier to use than the PC website or the mobile website. Best travel app I've downloaded, and I've downloaded quite a few.

Version 14.0.2 3
 (Almost there) Has some problems with applying time filters. Sometimes the filters go through and sometimes they don't. Otherwise a great app.

Version 14.0.2 4
 (Great App!) Only knock is that it doesn't give the total cost of the flight including taxes & fees until you tell it to book the flight. Other than that, it is very user friendly and fun to use!

Version 14.0.2 5
 (A must for all planning a trip) It doesn't matter if you are a frequent traveler or planning your first trip, this app is a must have. It has everything you need or all types of trips. Do download it, it will help you very much.

Version 14.0.2 4
 (Great app for travel research.) This app is a great resource for planning a trip.  First place I go  on the iphone when needing flight prices and options.

Version 14.0.2 5
 (I love k) This is the best app ever!!!!

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Cool) Cool

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Travel Pro) If you travel, you NEED this app!

Version 14.0.2 4
 (Perfect....but!) I was planning a trip to Vegas and some of the total costs that were displayed were not the total costs that the websites were giving! Other than that it's easy to use and has a wide array of selections!!!!! I really luv it!

Version 14.0.2 5
 (An Honest Review:) This is a great app, except that I have trouble running it on my iPad. There are also many glitches, but I guess that's what u should expect from free apps like this.  If u want to buy other apps but don't have the money, download the free app "Checkpoints" and use the code "babbehmom" for sign-up and u will get bunch of free gifts, such as $15-$30 iTunes giftcards

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Great app) very useful

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Torr74) Muy buena la aplicacion la recomiendo

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Just gets better and better) The only update I really would like is to be able to update trips within the app like on the website. (for when you make a change in your trip like many of us do frequently)

Version 14.0.2 2
 (No baby option) Appart that there is no way to input a baby passenger, the app works fine!
Pls update the kayak app so you can quote adults and babies.!! Then i wll rate this app with 5 stars.

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Im in love!!) But this app is amazingly helpful! Found the best hotels to suit our needs. Compares prices of different hotels side to side.. Useful for other things too! HIGHLY recommended!!!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Easy, reliable, awesome!) Man, I last used Kayak back when most people thought the web could only be accessed through AOL or Prodigy...until this app! I see I missed out on a lot in between. I've never had a problem w Kayak; the data is reliable and I find the app interface so usable I even prefer it to the computer. Guess I'm back where I started -- and happy with it!

Version 14.0.2 1
 (Orbitz Ruins the Whole Search) Shows prices that no longer exist, so it makes the whole search worthless. I won't touch Kaysk until they drop Orbitz from the search or fix that problem. It's already ended up costing me way too much money and aggravation.

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Surprisingly awesome!!) I'd have paid for this app! It's really smooth and intuitive, works like a charm! Has a great deal of options, connects to external sites to buy tickets. I was pleasantly surprised to discover a whole second page with options!

Love the packing lists and that you can edit them. I wish I could make new packing lists. Seems like all components are there to do it, I just can't find an Add List button. Love the app though and highly recommend it !

Version 14.0.2 5

Version 14.0.2 5
 (THIS IS ME DOING THIS) Yeah this thing is amazinngggg!

Version 14.0.2 4
 (A nice way to check flight prices) Works well most of the time, crashes here and there. I use it to get a sense of pricing, but always book with a travel agent, as everyone should. My travel agent can usually beat any price, but even if their price is the same, plus commission, it's well worth it (as any frequent flyer knows).

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Amazing) Love this! I simply whip through my travel planning. I have it installed on my iPad!

Version 14.0.2 5
 (So much info!! Easy to use!) I've been planning a trip recently to Tahoe and this app has been a lifesaver! I can literally plan-out and purchase just about everything for my vacation through this app! All the features work seamlessly and the ease of use is remarkable! Even allows u to send a maps with your location to others which is super smart! (Haven't used it yet but I feel it will be very useful later!) 2 thumbs up!

Version 14.0.1 5

Version 14.0.2 4
 (Great app) Great app. I just wish I could buy right from the app without having to switch to my browser. Please make this possible in the future.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Essential!) As a small business flying around the US can become hectic with flights and schedules to keep up with. Kayak, not only makes it easier to search for the lowest prices out there....make sure to use the trips icon which let's you store your trip info, such as flight, hotel, and car details, all in one app! I'm so glad I have come to familiarized with this app...I strongly recommend you use it!

 (Best app ever!) So many options to look at flights! Time, airline, landing, direct.... So easy to use and understand great job

Version 14.0.2 5

Version 14.0.1 4

Version 14.0.2 5
 (Filter layovers please?!) Great app!! So many things you can do!! You guys read my mind about the flexible dates! Please add a filter to adjust layover times tho. Some flights are 12hours stuck in another country.. It'd be really nice to eliminate those if possible..Thanks!!!

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Awesome app!) Great app! Works awesome and best free app for this need! Would easily give it 5 stars if on the map with the cool blinking plane it also showed a route pattern the plane would be taking. In other words a line from point "a" to point "b"! Keep up the good work guys!!!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Always helpful) Kayak just works. The only feature I would recommend for mobile users is the ability to see and compare airfare prices listed by days of week. This would help users so they don't have rerun a search query.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Awesome app) The app is both useful and fun! It has lots of features that are quirky but cool. Like being able to send a friend an email with a map of where you are from in the app. And it has a list of major airlines, a currency converter, the ability to set alerts, etc., which round it out as a travel app.

Version 14.0.1 4

 (Kayak) Love this app! The only problem (and it is a big concern) is the inability to purchase insurance when buying airline tickets. Other than that, this is a wonderful way to find the lowest price on a flight (without long layovers!) Easy search, easy purchase, and Kayak charges NO FEES.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Good) Love it!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Kayak owns!!!) Love this app. No issues.

Version 14.0.1 5

Version 14.0.1 4

Version 14.0.1 4

 (Great app) Great search engine app for everything. I use it all the game. Very easy to use.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Simple, easy and helpfull) Is quicker and easier to use than the web. The carry on pack list and and other tools are a friendly touch. Could be better if you could apply trip packages (car, hotel, flight,) instead of doing them separate

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Saved my vacation) On a recent trip, kayak sent me an alert that our flight was delayed by an hour. UsAirways sent no such alert and therefore we would have missed our connection. As a result of the Kayak alert I called the airline and they were able to put us on an earlier flight. Thank you Kayak!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (More Accurate Than Airport Display) My Jetblue flight was delayed by one hour, KAYAK showed that delay immediately, I asked the Jetblue checkin and they confirmed the delay. Believe it or not but the airport display in Seattle did not show the delay for 1 hour! Also other iPhone apps did not show the delay either. I enjoyed the extra time in the airport bookstore and arrived on time at the gate. Thanks KAYAK for the hasslefree extra hour.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Great App) Quick accurate info, love it!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Nice) Cool

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Great app for all travel needs) Has all the functionality as the website.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Cool app) The flight tracking feature is a trip!! Like the fact that you can get all kind of travel info.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Pretty good app) It's a nice app. The car area was excellent in getting us a car when we arrived.

Version 14.0.0 2
 (Overall excellent) I would have given this app 5 stars if I were able to book and pay for my flight within the app itself instead of having to "call the airline" or go to a separate website. Otherwise excellent. And free! Good job!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Easy to use) It's quick and easy searching for flights. It's a great app!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Good app - sometimes crashes) I go to this app for all my travel planning. I just wish it wouldn't crash. It doesn't do it too frequently.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Great app!) Excellent app for travel. The best I've used so far. Very functional. Not as intuitive as I'd like. Example - not obvious how to choose to search flights with a flexible date range.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Great App!) The best of it's kind, no contest!!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Great app) Everything for travel all in one

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Does the job) No complaints

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Daddy Likey) Clean design, simple yet very powerful search engine.  This app should receive an award for ease of use.  One of my favorites!! Thanks to the developer.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Amazing) I travel every week and I can't live without this app!!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Missing just one thing... In Trips) I love this app and especially the Trips feature. I just discovered this after returning from a NYC trip when I used the TripIt app. After having compared both itineraries, I preferred Tripit's display because it was larger, easier to understand and had details that Kayak did not that I thought were important. I took the train, so knowing the details of train number and type was very useful when reading train schedules at the station since my stop was not displayed at the station (since it was a midway stop) So I guess to sum it up:

1. Make the display in Trip section larger. 
2. Format it similar to TripIt
3. Provide more details such as train/flight number, type, etc. 

Overall, the rest of the app is 5 star. Would be 5 star for Trips if it was more like TripIt. I'd really prefer to not use two apps when Kayak could be my one stop app :)

Version 14.0.1 3
 (Flight tracker function still crashes) Still crashes upon selecting flights to track, even after the update that supposedly fixed the problem. The seperate kayak flight tracker app doesn't have this problem so I know they are capable of making it work right.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (So helpful) Everything about this app is great. Beacon feature, trips, flight statuses, airline fees, ETC are executed elegantly.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Great app!) Keeps getting better, thanks Kayak!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Best travel app) Great for real-time flight pricing

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Useful) Great app

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Great app!) I use app anytime I travel.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Frequent Traveler) Very easy to use and provides all one needs for a successful travel experience.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Very functional...easy to use) If you love "regular" Kayak, you'll enjoy this app. Function is more than you'd expect in app (ability to search multiple dates AND/or narrow results by very specific criteria).  Great to use on the go!

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Awesome app) Easy to look up and book flights!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Great app) +1 internets

Version 14.0.1 5
 (As good as web version) I've always liked the kayak.com search tool. The nobile version is as good as the website.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Love it) I'm not what you would call a seasoned traveler but this app has made traveling much less nerve wracking!

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Great help for travel) This is a great app for travel on the go

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Good Job) Nice app. I just would like to be able to build an entire trip with taxes etc. and have the prices auto update so o don't have to price out a trip again. Saving the built itinerary would be nice too.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Good) Good but a little slow

Version 14.0.1 1
 (doesn't work) what happened to kayak? it doesn't open anymore. I deleted and tries to reload and now a gray icon in mid load is all I have. please fix!!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Great app) No problems using app - works great & I compared to expedia and prices were right on

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Best) This is the best flight search I have found.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Wonderful app) Love it!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Abc1234) Saves a lot  of time. A must have app.

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Good stuff) Excellent tool for travel

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Time slider) I love the ability to use the time slider to pick my needed departure and arrival times.  Eager to learn more about the other features.  This is the only app I use for planning flights.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Easy to use. Helps a lot.) Only place I'll use now for plane tickets.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (New interface & features are great!) Much more robust - easy to use. So far I've only researched flights but very impressed by speed and usability. Nice work!

Version 14.0.1 4
 (Liking what I'm seeing so far!) I haven't used it for a trip yet but I've got one planned and I love that I can just send an email and it organizes my flight!!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Easy and amazing) My favorite travel site. No frills, smart and user-friendly.

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Awesome) Awesome app...I love it...

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Awesome App!) Nice interface - great features!  Very useful app!!! Great job!

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Best iPhone user interface to date) On word : PERFECT

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Simple and awesome!) I love this app. It will totally help you with your travel plans and compares prices so you can decide on what you want to do! ÓêÖ

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Awesome) Easy to use and saves money

Version 14.0.1 5
 (Fantastic) Really easy to use, great job!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Love it) I love you online. I love you even more on my phone!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Just great !!!) Simple and powerful :-)

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Kayak) Good app.  Easy.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Awesome) Well made app. Helps a soldier find the cheapest flights home.

Version 14.0.0 4
 (A must!) Easy to use, time saver!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Awsome!) Best travel app I have used yet!!!!!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Surprisingly amazing) This app is so comprehensive & easy to use, I think it might even be better than using the Internet! Searches load quickly and are easy to filter down, details & pics are right there, and it finds good hotel & flight deals. Love that you can see a directory of cafes & stores in your airport, and the accessible list of airline baggage fees.

Version 14.0.0 4
 (A touch confusing but gets the job done) I found some of the navigation around the app a bit on the confusing/roundabout way, but I love being able to compare prices of airlines ad check dates. I use it all the time.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Road Trip!!!) I love this app! No matter where I want to go this app is there to help me make my travel plans! 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! The Kayak App Rocks!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (I dig it) Really useful when you are traveling without a computer.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Great App) Easy to use, can't believe it's free!!

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Great!) Easy to use, very convienient. Love it.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Hard to find a better travel app) Kayak just can't be beat in function or style with this app. Love it.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Awesome) Great app

Version 14.0.0 5
 (The Only Travel App I use now!) After using the others, I've found I get all the travel planning I need done with this App alone! Easy to use and so convenient!

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Flight Info) Flight Status is covered with gray and something I can't see after the status refresh. 
and please, hour and minute part of flight status should be a real split-flap display alike.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Exelent App) I love it!

Version 14.0.0 3
 (GPS Always On) This is the best travel app ever, but the new version leaves the GPS on CONSTANTLY, even when the app is completely closed. It's a battery killer and the only option is to turn location services off for this app, which kills it's ability to find flights, travel, etc from your current location. Please fix this!!!

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Best deals) Love the web and the app

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Great updates) Really enjoy the upgraded features this time around. The search function is much clearer and user-friendly

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Awesome !!!) One of the best Apps in the market very organized and detailed. It is exactly what a frequent and non frequent  traveler needs. The packing list is great I can enter a reminder for things that I need to take with me for my future travel plans. 5 ÓåµÓåµÓåµÓåµÓåµ

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Kayak) Sweet app. Easy to use. Very helpful! Thanks Kayak :)

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Super great!) My god this app is amazing. It does everything and looks great. Fast full of info and easy. A travelers dream! Thanks

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Useful) Good app

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Mae20) Works well!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Great travel app) This is a great app for travelers on the go.

Version 14.0.0 3
 (Great app but GPS issue in version 14.0.0 needs fixing!!) Version 14.0.0 leaves GPS running constantly and depletes my iPhone 4 battery very quickly. Fix please!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Awesome) Awesome

Version 14.0.0 3
 (Like it) Good stuff works well thanks!

Version 14.0.0 3
 (New functionality, new bugs) The new functionality is good but the new version also introduced a bug where you cannot search for flights to nearby airports. As a result flight search does not have as many options as the ITA software travel app (OnTheFly).

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Love the New Version) Excellent improvements! Love the Fare Alerts feature.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (S2K2I) Best travel app hands down

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Keeps getting better and better) Love it.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Best travel app ever!) Best travel app ever!!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Nice app) Easy to use

Version 14.0.0 1
 (Beacon feature constantly tracks u) Beware the beacon feature is constantly tracking you even when u exit the app.  The only way to fix this issue is to turn off kayak location service in settings

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Lui Nurse) Excellent app. Just booked my flight, hotel, and car In just a few minutes.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Awesome) Amazing

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Kayak is a awesome app!!) Totally a great app!!

Version 14.0.0 1
 (Doesn't work at all) It won't let me change anything or do any searches. It's stuck on LA, which is thousands of miles off. Seems the interface doesn't respond at all to touch.

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Great App) No complaints from me, maybe make it a little faster, otherwise looks great and I get a ton of use out of it.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Awesomeness!) Awesomeness!

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Great App!) Easy to use and so convenient!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Just brilliant) This app will make your travel planning a whole lot easier!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Best) Kayak is the best travel site and this app rocks!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Great app!) Gets better with every update!!!!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Very Helpful) Convenient and quick (:

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Awesome!) Love the interface. Easy to use.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Fantastic) Fantastic easy to use app.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (great app) can't complain

Version 14.0.0 3
 (Used to be great, but...) I've been using this app for months now and have had few complaints, but the latest update has rendered the flight status tracker function completely useless. This used to be very helpful and was always easy to use. Now, however, it is neither: as soon as I select the flight I would like to track (if I even get that far), the app crashes. After six attempts (using different search approaches), and six crashes, I've given up. Please fix this!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Great App!) Very helpful!  Love the FREE price!

Version 14.0.0 4
 (CIO) Best app for biz traveler

Version 14.0.0 3
 (Location service broken) In general the app looks great. But the location service in the latest version seems to be broken.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Amazing app) Keeps getting better with each release.  This is my go to app when traveling.

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Missing) I just wish you could book hotel flight and car as pkg. That would be awesome.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Really handy) Best travel app

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Get it!) Great deals to be found using this app!!

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Excellent) Very good

Version 14.0.0 2
 (Beacon is locked) Now that I've used beacon one time the app causes the gps to stay locked on unless I manually close the app or turn off location services.

Version 14.0.0 5
 (One of best travel apps!) And it's free!
Update:  I can't believe it but they made it even better.

Update:  and better (love the airport info)

If you're complaining about having to go to safari, you're missing the point of the app.  You don't book through Kayak, idiots, you book through the actual site, meaning it would be impossible to book on the app.

Update:   Has become the Swiss army knife of travel apps

Version 14.0.0 5
 (:)) ÓåµÓåµÓåµÓåµÓåµ

Version 14.0.0 3
 (Bad prices!!!) Good concept, but the prices are never the lowest ones. Even when it refers you to orbits prices, if you go to the websites they always have different prices. Travelocity orbits and chepoair have much lower prices. Please fix. Would love to purchase tickets from app but way too expensive. Last flight I looked up was $200 higher than Travelocity!!! Please fix!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Perfect!) Love this app and the frequent updates - especially Kayak Trips!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Brilliant! 10 points to Kayak!) Fast, responsive, never buggy. Highly recommended, and forget about all other competitors. Nothing matches Kayak.com.

Best thing is, they'll keep on refining it and improving it. 

Kudos for Kayak.com!!!

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Great app!) This app keeps on getting better and better. Great job kayak people! ÓÄéÓÄé

Version 14.0.0 4
 (Nice) I once suggested to add currency converter, now it's here! Thanks kayak! One star added..

Version 14.0.0 5
 (Great Improvement) Great improvement. Thanks. Love it.

Version 13.0.2 2
 (Crashed) This app was good when first downloaded. But, after it did a update, this thing is now crashed. It won't recognize a simple airlines like United. Fix this thing.

Version 13.0.2 5
 (Superb!) By far, the best consolidated travel site! I have been a user for years and recently started using from my iPhone. It works the same as the website less The Buzz section. I just booked a trip to Europe through AA and it could not have gone smoother. Thanks for
making it easy and useful w/o any garbage on the screen. This app will save you time checking a dozen sites.

Version 13.0.2 2
 (Ugh completely useless) Used to love this app now it crashes when you try to enter airports. Please fix this and my rating will go back to 5 stars but until then DON'T BOTHER DOWNLOADING this app it's USELESS right now Óê°Óê°Óê°Óê°Óê°

Version 13.0.2 5
 (Snazzy) I really like this app.

Version 13.0.2 1
 (Unusable on 3G with newest OS.) Love kayak on computer but this app is now totally useless. Crashes out when trying to enter airports or dates. Please fix this.

Version 13.0.2 5
 (Awesome) So simple to use and it is set up perfectly! I have AAA and their app is bogus- this is great!!

Version 13.0.2 5
 (Good) Finally redownloaded this and see results for Continental Airlines results are now showing! Thanks

Version 13.0.2 5
 (Made my trip a breeze) Just took a 3350 mile car trip from Las Vegas to Seattle and back with no hotel reservations made in advance.  Using Kayak made this "flying without a net" approach work to perfection.  Being able to sort hotels/motels by price, classy or nearby couldn't have been easier.  Pics in most cases, descriptions and then tap to call and then either look on the included map or copy the address into Maps and get iPhone navi.  Nice job!

Version 13.0.2 2
 (Keeps crashing) Keeps crashing when trying to put in flight details. Not worth trouble

Version 13.0.2 2
 (questionable...) I sincerely question an app that gives 3 stars to a motel that is quite possibly the worst motel/hotel I have ever been in (not to name names, but its called the Park Entrance OceanFront Motel in Bar Harbor, Maine- please don't go there people!). It also crashed a number of times

Version 13.0.2 4
 (Great app!) Loving it so far. Nice simple UI and it's FREEÓå∑ÓÄéÓÄé

Version 13.0.0 5
 (Perfect for what it is) This is a fantastic app. I love the clean and easy to use layout, but mostly I live that I can book a flight directly from my phone and that it stores the info for the flight so it's super easy to find. Plus, it's free so great all around.

Version 13.0.2 2
 (Keeps crashing) Great app but it keeps crashing

Version 13.0.1 1
 (Didn't tell me about a 2 hour delay) This app kept showing my flight as "on time."  Good thing I went to the Continental Airlines site and found out on my own. I'll never rely on this piece of crap.

Version 13.0.1 5
 (Works great!) Very usable interface with all the features of the site. Great app! :-)

Version 13.0.1 4
 (It's good App) It's easy n fast app... And it's free

Version 13.0.1 5
 (A handy companion) Does everything I use the web version for, but with a much more simple interface. Quickly becoming one of my most used apps. Thanks, Kayak!

Version 13.0.1 1
 (No actual use) This app doesn't do anything you can't do on google or any search engine. Don't waste your time downloading it.

Version 11.2.0 4
 (Top notch) This is the best flight search app available. Does not let you book but the mobile purchase experience provided by airlines and other travel providers is subpar anyway so no real disadvantage there. Kayak's Search far exceeds that of SWA and AA iPhone apps (and those are both very good apps).

Version 13.0.1 1
 (Bait n Switch) First time I tried to use it it took me to iTunes and said I needed to buy the app fro $0.99 before I could use the options I chose. What a crock. Travel apps are free. What are they thinking?

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Great app) Two words... Love it!!!

Version 13.0.1 5
 (Outstanding app!!!) So far the best travel app I've tried and I've tried alot!
My only request is to add mote information to trips like gate info and seat info. Also the luggage pickup carrousel info. 
Also an ability to add trips directly in the app by using a locator code or confirmation number would be great as well. When you guys do that Tripcase is history!
Keep up the great work!

Version 13.0.1 3
 (Good app, needs flexible dates) Great app for finding and booking airfare however it lacks a flexible date capability for travel dates. I would book more on the app rather than online if it offered this feature.

Version 13.0.0 5
 (My Fav Travel Site) I've used kayak.com for years. Was thrilled to find the app for my phone. I'd say that this works even better on my iPhone than on my laptop!! Thanks for making it so quick and easy to use!!

Version 13.0.0 3
 (Yep) ÿ≠ŸÑŸà ÿ¥ÿ®ÿßÿ®

Version 13.0.0 4
 (Awesome App) Totally saved me and my family a ton of headache when our travel plans got turned around.  Awesome work and a should be on any travelers phone.

Version 13.0.0 5
 (Excellent) Great

Version 13.0.0 3
 (Okay) Nice App

Version 13.0.0 4
 (Pretty good app) It has relevant information but for some reason when you download it's called kayak M13!

Version 13.0.0 4
 (Best on iTunes) Great travel app to search flights, hotels, etc. The weird thing is my Kayak is called "Kayak M13" on my iPhone. Weird.

Version 11.3.0 4
 (Great App in my view) Used it immediately after downloading it, was really impressed with its speed and availability of information.

Version 11.3.0 5
 (One stop shop) Search for car rentals, flights, hotels, etc. Give you the same filters as you do on their website.

Version 11.3.0 5
 (From a user's standpoint . . .) this app is great. Like all apps, I could criticise this one to death over minor details but I wont. Thats because its helped me find TONS of options - FAST!  A sort by price option for hotels would be nice but it works well even without it.

Version 11.3.0 5
 (Great...if it really worked) Won't connect to the internet, which unfortunately is pretty necessary for the app to actually do anything useful.

Version 11.3.0 2
 (Does not show the cheapest flights) Everytime I search online I find cheaper flights with the same airlines they use on Kayak

Version 11.3.0 5
 (Great App) Very slick transitions, super job on graphics.  Clearly organized.  Nice work, guys!

Version 11.3.0 3
 (I love kayak) But this app version needs serious work.

Version 11.3.0 3
 (Saving flight info) Easy to use app but it would be great to be able to save flight information on a flight your thinking about and get messages on whether the fare has gone up or down

Version 11.3.0 5
 (Great app) This app helped me to save 600$. The Buzz is the best. Highly recommend

Version 11.3.0 3
 (Functional but poorly implemented) It does what it is supposed to perfectly - but the interface is a little slow and clumsy, and often jerky.

Version 11.3.0 4
 (Smooth) App is better then I expected. But trying to fin out how to save searched flights. Great tool for the traveler.

Version 11.3.0 2
 (Average at best) Average for most of it's services, but gets confused over flight times spanning different days - Kayak reports the wrong days: this alone makes it questionable as a flight tracker.

Version 11.3.0 5
 (Awesome traveling app!) It just made my traveling a lot more fun and easy! Best traveling app on iTunes store!

Version 11.2.0 3
 (Needs improvement) This app would of gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for two things:

1.) You get better pricing from their actual website. I don't know if it's a glitch or if they think iPhone users can afford more.

2.) I wish you could book package deals through here, like flight+hotel option or flight+hotel+event.

Add these on and nothing would even come close to this app in booking vacations.

Version 11.2.0 4
 (Great travel assistant) I use Kayak mobile mostly to book hotels when I need to find something fast and I don't want to pay a fortune. The app delivers and simplifies my life. 

There are some ads in the free version but not too disruptive.

Version 11.2.0 3
 (Please include package deals) While this app is very cool and I love the ease and search capabilities, I'd totally give this app 5 stars if only they would include package options. I'd like to see hotel/airfare/car combos for all over the world. Currently I use several sites for that, would love for it all to be in one app!

Version 11.2.0 1
 (Meh) It was great until after about 4 minutes of use.  Then it crashed and it hasn't come back.

Version 11.2.0 3
 (Can't Create Trip In-App) Love the potential but...

1. You can't create a new trip from the app. You have to do it from their website. 
2.  They link to all kinds of sites to book reservations (good). But it jabot even linked to their own website to easily create trips. 
3. The ads are not pictured in the store, but they are on the app. 

Kayak devs... Are there ads in the pay version?

Version 11.1.0 5
 (Brilliant!) Absolutely love this app! Best travel app out there!

Version 11.2.0 5
 (Very useful!!) This is a very useful app. I think this is a traveler must have app. Plus, it's FREE!! Two thumbs up!!

Version 11.2.0 4
 (Awesome!) Multiple segments would be very useful for some searches  but it's great for me as-is.

Version 11.2.0 5
 (Much improved) The new release of this app is far more stable. They have improved the interface and it is more appealing. Have used several times without trouble.

Version 11.1.0 4
 (Needs more airlines) Pretty great but needs more linesÓÄù besides that everything's awesome ÓÅó

Version 11.1.0 5
 (Very good!) I looked all over for an app for flights. Most of the airlines do not provide an app and if you do find one, it's just for one airline.  This app provides flight info for all the major airlines, including European travel. I think you'll like this.

Regarding hotels, you may want to check travel books or travel agents so you don't get stuck in a hotel near the airport and far from town.

Version 11.1.0 1
 (Not Accurate at all! And no cruises!) Needs to get fixed pronto!

Version 11.1.0 1
 (App blows!) This app stinks. Doesn't include all airports and prices. Told me the cheapest price was 219 from PA to FL. Found a price of 120 round trip on airline website. That's a 100 dollar savings just from doing a little homework. Per person x 3 people flying.  You do the math!  App deleted!

Version 11.1.0 5
 (Best in Class) I've tried them all. This one gives you the most correct data and automatically sends to to the website of the airline, hotel or car rental agency you have chosen. 
I have reviewed others. This is the best. 
Follow me @ratedgforgeek on Twitter.

Version 11.1.0 4
 (Flight tracker has bugs) This is a fantastic app in general. Two things:

1) The flight tracker continues to change to today's date regardless of the day I select originally. First I select a flight that is 2 days from now, but as soon as I save it, the app changes the date to 1 day from now. The next time I refresh it changes to today's date.

2) Feature request: search using flexible dates.

Version 11.1.0 4
 (Best hotel app. Period.) None of the others work as smoothly.
Still... "call hotel to reserve"?! I want to do it from the app! That, sadly, can't be done.

Version 11.1.0 5
 (Great tool) Simple and does what it says !

Version 11.1.0 5
 (Kayak Unstable) Kayak constantly crashes and is therefore unusable at all. This is total junk. Kayak needs to have their heads examined to put out a piece of junk as this. Stick with their full web presence, which is an awesome tool.

Version 11.0.0.0 4
 (Pretty good) As a frequent traveler and flier, I use the Kayak app often. I'm quite pleased with the new multi-city option. But one of my favorite things about kayak.com is the flexible departure and return date options. I hope that will be included in the next update. Thanks!

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Superb Production) Really well done. I have been disappointed that United Airlines hasn't released an iPhone app, until I discovered all the tools in the Kayak app. Now I no longer need them to - This thing is sweet!

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Best App Ever) On top of being incredibly useful, this app has the best user interface of any app I've ever seen. I get frustrated with a lot of apps because the user interfaces are slow or lacking small but helpful features. The writers of the Kayak have paid attention to every single detail. I was blown away.
It did crash on me but, being a software engineer myself, I understand that bugs happen. I'm sure they'll fix them.
One feature request: in the airports view where different venders are listed and searchable, you should add airlines so we look up which terminal a particular airline is in when we're on the way to the airport.

Version 2.2.0.2 1
 (Theshow) The show con el coyote

Version 11.0.0.0 1
 (Crashes) Can't track a flight that I booked elsewhere although they say you can. Keeps crashing. So far not impressed.

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Amazingg) This is what exactly what we need a simple search engine for flights. Thank you for creating such an app and making it free! Must have

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Excellent App) Love the app! This saved me a bundle on my upcoming trip. Also has good speed. Would recommend it to all my buddies.

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Mr) Excellent. Cool new stuff

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Nice app!!) Great app/update. Just one thing, the maps don't zoom anymore. Plz fix it, thanks.

Version 11.0.0.0 1
 (New version broken?) New version crashes often.

Version 11.0.0.0 1
 (Update) What happened to "search nearby airports" and all these damn ads!!! Shouldn't have updated....

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Great App!) This is a fantastic app that just keeps getting better with each version. Thanks, Kayak

Version 2.2.0.2 5
 (I LOVE YOU KAYAK !!!) Awesome , I buy all my trips on kayak ( and yes they are many :)  , love the new update , I don't need to use my computer anymore , kayak Anywhere and everywhere ! Long live kayak !

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Great!!!) Ability to narrow hotel searches by dragging and resizing a radius circle on a map is a great feature...great app for on-the-go planning.

Version 11.0.0.0 5
 (Excellent) Latest update is the best on-stop flight search out there. One minor bug: upgrade button tells you price of Pro version is $0.99 then takes you to app store where it's actually $1.99. Fix to avoid bait/stitch accusations.

Version 2.2.0.2 5
 (Perfection) Great app! Searches most travel websites and gives you THE BEST DEALS out there.goin to FL frm SEA on the 24th... Thanks KAYAK!!

Version 2.2.0.2 4
 (Could be better) How about a total time duration for the whole trip if more than one flight? Is that difficult to add?

Version 2.2.0.2 3
 (Useful but too slow and cumbersome) I like the basic premise that Kayak brings to the table but I simply don't have the time to waste booking on multiple sites.  I find the entire process slow and a bit cumbersome. But the app is useful for those that have the time.

Version 2.2.0.2 1
 (Uh-oh, trouble connecting to Kayak. Try again.) When I click to change locations I keep getting this error "Uh-oh, trouble connecting to Kayak. Try again." I removed and downloaded it again and I still get the message everytime I try to change the location.

Version 2.2.0.2 4
 (the icon...?) What's up with this new icon..? totaly nonsense... I deleted this app because of that.

Version 2.2.0.2 1
 (Useless) Perhaps I just don't understand the purported benefits of this application. Linking me to Orbitz is not what I need when searching for hotel. Nor is the hotel's telephone number. I need to specify the hotel I want and for the app to find the best deal for that hotel - using multiple sources. I can visit Orbitz.com in Safari all by myself. Besides, over half of the time Kayak app can't connect to its servers - on WiFi or 3G.

Version 2.2.0.2 5
 (Awesome) Definitely one of the best apps i've ever got. Fast and easy

Version 2.2.0.2 5
 (Great) Very good app. So far has been accurate. This one us a keeper.

Version 2.2.0.2 4
 (For flights) Great so far, just like on the computer!

Version 2.2.0.2 5
 (love it) love this app!

Version 2.2.0.2 2
 (Flight tracker crashes it EVERY TIME) When it hits the calendar to pick a date

Version 2.2.0.2 5
 (Get this app. ) Checks hundreds of flights in mere seconds. This app is a real time saver. Highly recommended. 
Sam R.

Version 2.2.0.2 5
 (Iphone App Testing) A very nice app, may I suggest you contacting app rebates and putting the free app in the list

Version 2.2.0.1 3
 (Previous version was better) Upgraded and it's not as lean and fast as before. Kind of clunky and forgets previous searches. Would love to roll back to the original.

Version 2.2.0.1 4
 (Excelent app for travelers) Very good app for searching and book trips without a laptop or any computer. I book all my last travel with the help of this app.

Version 2.2.0.1 1
 (NEED MORE...) NEED MORE!!! WHEN YOU PLAN TO RENT A CAR NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO RETURN THE CAR TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION!!!!! THIS IS EXTREMLY IMPORTANT FOR ME!!!!

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (Best travel app around) I love how you can flick your finger to select date ranges. very cool. Please, wizards at Kayak, add flight status! Thanks

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (AMAZING) You really have to try it for yourself! Seriously it's that great

Version 2.2.0.1 3
 (Thought I loved it. ) I THOUGHT this would end my having to drag a lap top with me everywhere. NOPE.  I was trying to get multiple flight prices to multiple destinations.  At one point it told me I had exceeded the allotted number of seraches?  Really? So, not all it's cracked up to be. 


Version 2.2.0.1 4
 (Good But Crashes) Good app, but almost useless. It crashed way too much. Usually within 2 minutes of being in the app.

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (incredible) this app is exactly what it should be. I can't tell you the number of times I've used this while in an airport when my flight was goofed. it's a perfect app for last minute arrangements as well as planning ahead. I love the fact that you can save your trips (by simply forwarding confirmation emails!) and refer to them on the iPhone app while on the road. 

highly recommended for anyone who travels. 

(note: I'd love to have the ability to search for multi-destination flights)

Version 2.2.0.1 2
 (Disappointing) This would be a great app but it locks you out for an indefinite period of time after just a few searches! I was locked out in the middle of something critical and it was really frustrating. Not clear whether you still get locked out if you pay, so I am looking for something more reliable.

Version 2.2.0.1 4
 (Fast and easy to use...two suggestions for improvement) Love this app!  It's fast and super easy to use.  My one complaint is that you can't set your preferred preferences so that every time you search it is already set and then you can adjust it, but considering it's free it's a pretty damn good app. I do wish you could search for best last minute deals from a departure city as well.  Maybe in the next version?!  : )

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (Great App !) Surprisingly well written app, saves tons of time, it's so nice to have rates from different travel sites, and even from the hotels' own sites, all in one place. A pleasure to use, quick and easy, would definately recommend.

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (A+) Nothing more you could ask for in a free travel app.

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (Great One place to get all your planning done for your travels!!!!) One stop shop for everything!!!!

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (Simply the BEST. ) Fast, smooth, simple. What else can you ask for. This app is great if you manage group travel and need travel info NOW!

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (Unbelievable...of course) Stunning app. Use it consistently. Updates have been awesome, but would love to see multiple segment/destination support.

Version 2.2.0.1 4
 (Very good) This site is like a big brother always there when you want it but more important always there when you need it

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (GreatttÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄé) Amazing app.... Love it just wish there were reviews of hotels, airlines, and places...ÓÅóÓÅóÓÅóÓÅóÓÅóÓÅóÓêüÓÅäÓÅäÓÅäÓÅäÓÅäÓÅä

Version 2.2.0.1 4
 (Terri) Great app. As long as I've emailed you my flight confirmations to generate a trip itinerary, why not track those flights for me?  Why ask me to input them into your tracker? You already have the information.

Version 2.2.0.1 3
 (GM) I'm a hotel GM, and the Kayak app is pretty cool, but there are some issues you should know about. Kayak partners with hotels in sometimes very round-about ways, and many times the rates they quote for my hotel are fairly unrelated to what I've actually authorized (usually much more expensive).  

Additionally, there seems to be an affiliated travel site (ReserveTravel) that marks the prices up astronomically, and does things like trick you into calling an 800 number supposedly to book a reservation, but you end up calling a "service" that'll cost 9.95/mo if you hit the wrong button.  They're using my brand to try to scam you... not cool to say the least. Always use the "call hotel directly" button and not other numbers to be safe. 

Bottom line: It's a cool app to learn about hotels but you will be safer and always get a better deal if you call or book on our website (and it's likely the same for all hotels).  I'd use the Yelp app first.

Version 2.2.0.1 4
 (Does the job quite Nicely) Hotels, Flights, Car Rental... it's no problem for Kayak.  This is a must have for the constant traveler.

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (Love it..) Simply putting it..!  Nice..easy..and clean to use and understand.

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (Very useful app for frequent travelers) Kayak gets better and better. Much faster than previous versions and very good designed with a love for details. I have status with American Airlines and therefore book my flights mostly with this airline. To my surprise the Kayak search engine finds the best AA flights faster then Americans Website. Good job.

Version 2.2 4
 (Great for searching, lousy for booking) This app makes searching for flights a breeze!  I cannot imagine using any other service, and now they have an app especially for the iPhone!  Rejoice, right?

Wrong.

Although this app makes searching a breeze, you still have to book your flights through mobile safari, which is just a PITA.  I'm not blaming it on Kayak's app that filling in a bunch of form fields on mobile safari is a pain, I'm upset at them for not integrating a way to automatically book a flight through their app (without the need to resort to mobile safari).

Otherwise, the app is good!

Version 2.2.0.1 1
 (Can't connect) It just says uh oh unable to connect. Even if I got wi-fi or full 3G coverage!

Version 2.2.0.1 5
 (Second to none) This app's functionalities and UI are second to none.  Get it while its free because its the best.  It gets better and better each update to an already flawless app.

Version 2.2 3
 (Missing something...) No multiple city option?

Version 2.2 5
 (Great) Fujfj

Version 2.2 4
 (Great app just few things need to fix) It's a bit of a memory hog or leaks, and when I want to search flight needs and option where I can choose times not sorting them just and option before searching.

Version 2.2 5
 (Works very well) I would only add one feature, find the best flight rates given a date range

Version 2.2 2
 (Eh) BookMe Travel Search app is better in my opinion.

Version 2.2 5
 (The perfect travel tool!!!) This app ROCKS!!!  I love it!  I am an airline employee, and this is going to come in handy!  I have been using the Kayak site for years, but the iPhone app is the best, hands down!

Version 2.2 5
 (Amazing) This app has got to be the best flight search app on the planet. It is even easier than doing it on the Internet with a comptuer. Easily the best app I own, and it's free!!

Version 2.2 5
 (Works!) Just what I needed

Version 2.2 5
 (Loving it!) What else to say, this app is great.

Version 2.2 5
 (Great App) I have been using Kayak.com for years. The iPhone application does the job very well. The last update fixed some filtering issues and added a very nice flight tracker for free. Can't get better than this.

Version 2.2 5
 (Best Flight App) This App helped me find the exact flight I needed very quickly. Thanks so much Kayak!

Version 2.2 4
 (Great, but needs in-app browser) Very handy for finding low fares and room rates.  It would help if web pages linked from listings could open within the app, rather than by launching Safari.  Although Kayak helpfully remembers your place, the hopping between apps is awkward.

Version 2.2 5
 (I use it everyday for travel) Awesome app. Please provide a little excuse to buy the paid app and I will.

Version 2.2 5
 (Great update) Thanks for displaying seat assignments and all travelers names on trips now. Stability is great now as well. Thanks!

Version 2.0.1 5
 (My favorite travel app) Very easy to use app, maybe even more so than the web based version. Quickly & easily let's you check many airlines prices, routes, travel times & more. Hotels are easy to find with the use my location feature.

Version 2.2 5
 (Wow) This App is even better than before.  Really can't think of anything I don't like about this app. 

Version 2.2 5
 (GREAT. ) I am not a huge fan of the website so I was somewhat hesitant on the app but it was free so.......ÓÄéÓÄéÓÄùÓÄùÓÄùÓÄùÓÄù ÓÄ¢ÓÄ¢ÓÄ¢it!!! I found an airport nearby that I never even thought to use. This is a must have FREE app if you plan yo book any flights or just looking to plan a trip! Saved me $100 off the bat!

Version 2.2 5
 (Fast and simple!) Love this app...fast and easy to use.

Version 2.0.1 5
 (A must for Travelers & vacation planning) A big time saver for researching travelling, vacations. User frendly app& easy to use.

Version 2.0.1 5
 (It's Perfect) I love this app, it's fast, finds great prices, and has one of the best interfaces of any iPhone app.

Version 2.0.1 4
 (Great app ) I love this app and use it to look for upcoming flights I take for martial arts tournaments. I would love to see it able to do multi destination flights though

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Great app) This is a well thought out app. Great job.

Version 2.0.1 4
 (Excellent but for the time filter slide bars) For a freebee, this is one of the best apps on the market.  It does pretty much everything as advertised.  

But I do have one issue...use of touch slide bars to the set the departure and arrival time parameters.  Touch screen slide bars are just too awkward on a small screen.  In Kayak, for example, the slightest movement of a slide bar could result in hours of change in acceptable time intervals.  

The SouthWest air booking app is far better in doing this function in that it gives just a few intervals for acceptable departure times: before noon, noon to 6pm, after 6pm, and any time.  And that works just fine thank you.  At most, six four-hr intervals over 24 hours, plus anytime, should do it.  You know: 00-04, 04-08, 08-12, 12-16, 16-20, 20-24, anytime.  Get rid of those slide bars.

I understand SouthWest Airlines doesn't want to play, but if you could get them to join in with all the other airlines you cover in Kayak, you would have a real coup over the competition.

Version 2.0.1 3
 (Multiple Cities) Please add multi city lookup. Love Kayak.

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Best Travel App Available!) Allows you to search flights, hotels, cars, etc. Breaks down flights by price, time, or distance. Wonderful app to have when looking into traveling!

Version 2.0.1 5
 (This is it) Great app gr8 price$$$$ going some where not with out this app ur not

Version 2.0.1 4
 (Gotta Get It!!) This is a must-have app for anyone who travels.  I just booked a 3 week vacation complete with flights and car rentals with the amazing help of KAYAK. Try it NOW!!! It's free anyway.

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Still crashing ) Still crashing even after update. Most unstable when trying to search flights.

Version 2.0.1 2
 (It's ok) No multi-city searches on this version makes me rate this app low on my scale.

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Awesome!) Searches all the top travel sites at once to get the best price.

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Love it) I love this app.  Planned a trip with it and it wa super easy to use.  Much nicer than it's browser based cousin.

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Fantastic) If you have ever used kayak then you should have this app. It is awesome!

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Awesome!) Exactly what I wanted from Expedia, Travelocity, or Orbitz, but all fell short.  Kayak is the one that came through. Best travel app period... And it's free.

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Great app) Easy to use, highly recommend!!

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Great app!!) I absolutely love this app it is accurate fast and a beautiful UI.   thanks

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Multi-city search) I really like this app just I flight often to multi destinations and I don't have the ability of booking my flights thru this app. I hope we will have it soon!! Congrats!

Version 2.0.1 5
 (As easy and great as the site!) Love the app, love the site, works fine anywhere.

Version 2.0.1 4
 (SEARCH LIMIT) This app is cool, but there is a search limit, so no bargain hunters or people getting ideas for prices.

Version 2.0.1 4
 (Amazing App!!) I will never book my travel any other way, couldn't be easier to sort through airfare options! Hotel listings need more photos, other than that, this app is awesome!!!

Version 2.0 5
 (Very polished, strong app. ) I loved it before the recent update, and you've taken it to another level. Way to go! I used this a few months ago to book hotel accommodations and it worked wonderfully; this will definitely remain a regular for me.

Version 2.0.1 5
 (Kayak made their app even better) Kayak keeps adding new features every month or so. Version 2.0 has a lot of new things that are not mentioned on the iTunes page: 
- more currency choices
- "prefer nonstop" option
- "include nearby airports" option
- multiple passengers
- multiple hotel guests
- multiple hotel rooms
- additional filter options


Version 2.0 1
 (It doesn) It loaded, however, it never works.  The "K" screen appears, then it faids away.  Absolutly useless!

Version 2.0 4
 (I use kayak on my PC regularly and like this iPhone app) I have found kayak to be one of the best travel apps out there for comparing flights and hotels. I used the app for a trip to Denver this week and it worked flawlessly. I do wish it had the ability to search using multiple flight segments

Version 2.0 5
 (It crashes! But Nice app) Crashes like a hell.

Version 2.0 5
 (Just perfect for my needs!) Just perfect for my needs - for free!

Version 2.0 5
 (Where's the flex date option?) If you don't already use Kayak, you are wasting your money. The website offers a few extras that the app does not, such as multiple-leg segments and flex dates, but it's still better than any other travel search apps. Kayak, please add these options so we are website free!

Version 2.0 5
 (Awesome app!) Would be even better if Buzz reflected ticket prices in search month. I've pointed all my friends to this app... It's free, it's easy to use and it works!

Version 2.0 3
 (Handy, not perfect) The newer version crashes less often than that of six months ago, but I still need multiple city searches and flexible dates before I leave Orbitz. Keep at it!

Version 2.0 3
 (Love the original but...) Huge fan of Kayak, and I used the old version all the time. But I haven't been able to conduct a single search with out it crashing since I "upgraded" to v2.0!! So frustrating!
 
Only giving this particular version three stars. Kayak overall gets a five!'

Version 2.0 1
 (Cannot use) Keeps saying cannot connect to server

Version 2.0 5
 (Excellent !) In this app you'll find everything you need to book a flight, hotel, car rental and more !

I've found the best rates here, flight and hotel (it uses booking.com). In march we'll be going to NYC !
Thanks a lot Kaiak !

Most important: this app is free and does not contain ADS ! 
Beautiful.
Roger, Belgium.

Version 2.0 4
 (Please Add Multi-City Flight Search) Love Kayak, love the app, but please add multi-city flight search (which your website offers and does a great job of). Should not be all that difficult to implement as this app already offers one-way lookups. Will go to 5-star for me when this is added. Thanks and please keep up the excellent work!

Version 2.0 5
 (Works just like the desktop version) I love kayak and this app is very easy and accurate.

Version 2.0 5
 (Awesome travel app) A+!!!! APP!!!! Best travel app ever!!!

Version 2.0 2
 (Crashes!) Great idea. I especially like the Trips feature, but it crashes too much. We need an update!

Version 1.6.1 4
 (Best on the go tool) This is one of the best on the go tools
I wonder if people really know about it or not coz I don't think so

Version 2.0 4
 (Only missing one thing) I wish they would add a feature where you can look for a flight/car/hotel package. If they add that I will give it 5 stars. Other than that I love this app. Very easy to use. I've not had any crashing problems. I can't believe this app is free.

Version 2.0 5
 (It's Brilliant. ) This is a really well designed app. It's easy to use and fast (on Wi-fi). As another reviewer noted, the ability to do multiple segments would be nice. But this is a free app after all. They've thrown down the guantlet to Orbitz and the airlines.

Version 1.6.1 3
 (Almost there.) I only use Kayak for flights, but I find it lacking even in that. I rarely fly alone, but Kayak gives you no opportunity to specify how many tickets you want in the app. Worse, neither do the companies you actually buy from, when you follow the links from Kayak's app. So I can't actually use the app to purchase anything, only to window-shop. Also, the drag-to-select dates feature is a nice idea but completely fails if you're leaving near the end of the month and returning in the beginning of the next month.

Fix these issues and it'll be a five-star app. But not being able to actually purchase from it is a deal-breaker.

Version 2.0 4
 (Best free travel app out there) Forget the rest

Version 2.0 1
 (Tough to Review an App that Crashes Every Time) I'd like to give a more comprehensive review, but this app crashes every time I've tried to use it.

Version 2.0 3
 (Great - but...) Need to be able to search for multiple flight segments (e.g. Baltimore to Salt Lake to Lexington and back to Baltimore). Almost all my trips are multiple-segment flights. I'd even pay a few bucks for such a thing.

Version 2.0 2
 (Very slow and locks up) When seaching for a flight it would be better if we could put in criteria before the initial search. Dissappointing

Version 2.0 5
 (Latest update made an already great app even better!) This app is incredibly useful, and the latest update included a great user interface overhaul as well as the ability to track existing trips, and the app is faster than ever now, which addresses my only real complaint about previous versions. Highly recommended!

Version 2.0 3
 (Good app but...) This is a very useful app. But lately i've been able to find cheaper flights elsewhere. COME ON. step it up!

Version 2.0 2
 (Oversimplified - Cannot Specify Needs) Too simple, lacks search options. Cannot specify class in airline search, quality or neighborhood in hotel search. For example Mexico city (20 million people, bigger than some countries) returns thousands of results, pointless!!! Too bad because the GUI and speed of search is tops in the field.

Version 2.0 5
 (Handy & free) Best app for searching travel related info at the moment in the free app side...I used it mainly for searching overseas flights etc, it gave me very competitive pricing...like it and will keep it

Version 1.6.1 1
 (Update) How many times do I need to dload the app update?  Either it's not updating or something else is wrong.  Very annoying

Version 1.6.1 2
 (Great app, but...) I've tried downloading the latest update about a thousand times with no luck.

Version 1.6.1 1
 (Ok app..) But it keeps insisting i havent downloaded the update in the app store.

Version 2.0 5
 (Kayak's still the best!) I've tried a lot of other services, but I keep on coming back to Kayak.

Version 1.6.1 5
 (Great for on the go) Great mobile solution to get flight times/prices on the go.

Version 1.6.1 4
 (Share option?) Very quick and good usability. However I would like the option to share my results

Version 1.6.1 1
 (Junk App) Crashes all the time and I can never get it to find airports so essentially it's useless.

Version 1.6.1 4
 (Good tool for travelers) Have used this app several times and i am very pleased with the results.

Version 1.6.1 5
 (Awesome Free App) Worked great for me. Hasn't crashed yet and I love all the filters.

Version 1.6.1 2
 (Limited search) It won't let me search anymore because I exceeded my search allowance. It is not really free because they want you to purchase the apps after you exceeded your search or else, you have to wait I don't know how long before you can search flights again.

Version 1.6.1 3
 (Like it ÓÅó) But would be nice for option to email results

Version 1.6.1 2
 (Crash-o-Rama!) Could be a great, great app but it just crashes WAY to much. Multiple times when I try to use it. Some searches would make the app crash everytime, making those searches impossible. Fix the crashes and add date ranges for flexible searches and you've got a slam dunk 5 star app!

Version 1.6.1 4
 (Need an update) Why can't I open it up?? I need to use it everyday! Please do something

Version 1.6.1 5
 (Best Travel App) Just downloaded this app to check some ticket prices and was surprised at  how good the UI was and how well it worked. It also searches fir hotel and car rentals. A must have!!!

Version 1.6.1 5
 (Nice) I like kayak

Version 1.6.1 4
 (decent app) useful for unexpected travel! would like to be able to search fares from multiple airports at once...

Version 1.6.1 5
 (d_joe) better the paid app

Version 1.6.1 4
 (Good!) Crashes sometimes. Would be nice to have flexible dates. Thanks!

Version 1.6.1 4
 (Pretty Decent!) This app is great for on the go ticket prices, the only thing I would like to see is the ability to do multi-city flights.

Version 1.6.1 4
 (Convenient) This is a nice app that makes it extremely quick and easy to check the latest fares.

Version 1.6.1 5
 (Easy) Very fast! And accurate I was able to find a flight quick and easy.

Version 1.6.1 5
 (Nice) Helps me a lot.Great companion for a traveler like me.

Version 1.6.1 4
 (When it's good it's very very good ...) When the app doesn't crash - it's wonderful. I prefer Kayak over the purchased app that I was using to find flights. Too bad I found this after purchasing a flight search app.

Version 1.6.1 1
 (Nice idea, but unstable) Since last update, this app crashes repeatedly, making it unusable.

Version 1.6.1 5
 (A killer app) I've used this app quite a few and it's a HIT keep on ur good work thank you KAYAK

Version 1.6.1 4
 (Great app) Fast and easy!!

Version 1.6.1 4
 (Kayak) Easy to use, fast, responsive, beats Expedia/Travelocity etc online. Love the Trends feature!

Version 1.6.1 3
 (I like Kayak website, but this app is not even close.) Many functionalities are missing

Version 1.6.1 1
 (Needs work.) Glitches, crashes and does not find the cheapest fares.

Version 1.6.1 3
 (New version, icon fixed, seems stable) 1.6.1 fixes the icon great. I couldn't stand to look at it before. How about the title Kayak instead of KAYAK to be even more consistent with other apps. At least it doesn't start with lower case. 

Seems pretty stable so far the few times I used it. Look forward to future UI and functionality improvements. For ex some infrequent routes could use some helpful hints such as what days if the week have any flights possible for ex from SFO to BON (I had to read some web articles to figure the
possible days out) 

================

It was a decent app before, a sometimes useful interface to the kayak site. The new app however crashed several times in a row before finally starting up properly. And the icon, as others already pointed out, is woeful to look at - they've decided in the interest of their new "branding" that they will use some rectangular shape that is painfully out of place on the iPhone screen. I do not understand, sympathize, or have any tolerance for vendors who insist on their own crazy, zany icon shapes with no respect for the consistency users value on their iPhone (round or other funky shaped icons with black backgrounds, I'm looking at you also). Deleted and goodbye.

Version 1.6.1 5
 (great app) I love travelling and I use this app most of the time.

Version 1.6.1 5
 (Great tool) Fantastic application.  Wonderful   Implementation.  Now that crash bug is fixed in v1.61.  Highly recommend.

Version 1.6.1 5
 (Awesome app!!) As a photographer who is constantly travelling, this app has quickly become a good friend. I've been able to save a few bucks and valuable time using this app; so I highly recommend it to anyone. I would've gladly paid for this service; fortunately it's FREE!!

Version 1.6 1
 (crashes) OMG..It crashes a lot.Fix it please.

Version 1.6 2
 (Drop it like it's hot) Uhh yeah, this app drops me whenever I hit the search button. Automatic Fail. Really, Kayak???

Version 1.6 1
 (New version is crashing...) Past versions with bugs and last one crashes on startup.

Version 1.6 4
 (Useful, comes in handy on road trips) Just changed my rating because I just read about the 24hr bug. Otherwise works great and comes in very handy on road trips. Not giving it 5 stars because the hotel rates that come up for the same dates, etc. are less on hotels.com

Version 1.6 1
 (New update hurts!) Used to love this product, couldn't give it enough stars. Updated to the newest version, and now it keeps crashing. Correct this problem, and the rating will go back to 5 stars.

Version 1.6 4
 (NIce app) I usually travel to different countries,this app helps me alot

Version 1.6 1
 (Crash crash) Can't search flights. Crashes!

Version 1.6 1
 (Crashes !!) Every time I tend to search for flights, it CRASHES !!!...tried uninstalling and re-installing...still of no use.

Version 1.6 2
 (Bugs bugs bugs...) Bugs bugs bugs !!! They keep on updating the app but there's always bugs, it keep on crashing!!!!!

Version 1.6 3
 (Works well when not crashing) I have been using this app to search for flights and it has not let me down until today, when I really needed it, and it updated via the app store to v1.6.  Crashes every time I search for a flight now.  Hopefully the developer will either pull v1.6 or release an update soon to fix this.

Version 1.6 1
 (Crashorama) Would love to try this app but it crashes every single time I try a flight search. Maybe it's just telling me "don't go to Detroit"?

Version 1.6 1
 (crashes every time) Every time I hit the search button it crashes shortly after

Version 1.6 3
 (Phone dialer still not fixed) The last 3 versions have had issues with the "Call to book now" button. Some of them dial out, but a lot do not work. This needs to be fixed! Also, the non-standard icon is kind of weird.

Version 1.6 1
 (Crashes) Crashes everytime with the new update.  The new icon is also very ugly.

Version 1.6 3
 (The icon did it...) I don't really travel much, although this app would seem useful to keep on a just-in-case basis. I'm extremely OCD about the icon's dimensions looking awkward compared to the other apps which actually follow standards, so I deleted this. They should probably realize that iPhone owners like their screens neat and well designed, and seriously, as ridiculous as it sounds, the icon was the dealbreaker.

Version 1.5.2 3
 (Almost Excellent) Why does this program do only a few airlines? Southwest and the other larger airlines should be here as well. Add more airlines and this would be 5 stars. The program works flawlessly.

Version 1.5.2 5
 (Fantastic) I'm useing the 3.0 beta 5 software and the app worked first time. Perfectly. It worked as well as the website. Showed results before the search was finished. Then finished and updated the results. Was about as fast as the site. But looked sleeker and cooler. This app is worth getting. These people with Internet problems are wrong. It worked perfectly for me. It's as good as the website. But made for your phone.

Version 1.5.2 5
 (So cute ÓÑÜÓÑÜ) I absolutely love this app. It's perfect. It's so clean & easy to use. ÓÄéÓÄéÓÄé

Version 1.5.2 4
 (Great site makes very nice app.) Awesome for tracking down flights... only thing missing is the flexible dates option like on their site. Other than that, definitely worth having!

Version 1.5.2 3
 (New app icon is super ugly) Why mess with design perfection??? The original kayak app icon was so handsome.  The new one blows. I like the app nonetheless, but please get rid of this hideous icon.

Version 1.5.2 2
 (Doesn't live up to the underlying website) I'm a fan of kayak.com but this application doesn't live up to the quality of the parent site. The app crashes more often than not and doesn't seem to handle slow connections well at all. I've had to go back to using Safari to access kayak.com. Most unfortunate since the potential for an app to squeeze more out of a skinny connection is significant.

Version 1.5.2 1
 (Should be renamed Krash) Konstantly krashes

Version 1.5.2 1
 (Crashed) It has crashed several times.I am going to delete this app

Version 1.5.2 2
 (App is useless ) It crashes 50% of the time... Bad, bad, bad!!!

Version 1.5.2 2
 (ok app) i never used the previous version of this app which others seem to rave about. i would say it is ok to get a general sense of airline prices while you are on the go, but after reading other reviews, i would not book my travel based on results from this app. as noted elsewhere, this app does crash frequently. regarding the icon, it appears the designers didn't make the background behind the "K" different enough from the iphone background, so it looks like the icon has different proportions - not a deal-breaker for me, but it does look odd and i agree that it should be fixed.

Version 1.5.2 3
 (Do not download the latest update!) 9/16/09

Although the new design of the icon is better looking, this app crashes more frequently than the time before I updated this app.

Version 1.5.2 5
 (Best flight search app) Easy interface. Nice filters and sort. Btw, south west isn't searched because south west doesn't use brokers.

Version 1.5.2 4
 (Very good app, but needs tweeking) I really like this app... Very hood UI, easy to use and searches international as well as domestic great!! I for one love the logo (as they say... Opinions are like ....) but I do have a suggestion for the developers. Please include a way to search for class of service on flights. Especally on overseas flights, I'm not interested in coach seats. I also noticed that the distances from city center points are not accurate for hotels. In Yountville, CA for example; a hotel in the center of town (Yountville Inn) is listed as 3.46 miles away, which by the way puts it in Napa.  Just one example many mistakes. But, overall, very good tool.

Version 1.5.2 2
 (A step down) This was a rock-solid and nicely done app - until the last update. Kayak now crashes way too frequently and has become rather annoying. Also, the new icon is U-G-L-Y and looks horribly out of place on the iPhone's home screen. Sounds petty, but it bugs me. I hope they fix both of these problems because it was functionally a decent app.

Version 1.5.2 1
 (Not impressive) UI is good.But app doesn't have much helpful features.

Version 1.5.2 1
 (Terrible App...) This app has a fantastic UI, but unfortunately the information is limited at best. It excludes several major carriers from the list (such as Southwest, which I know services my desired cities).

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Does Not Work) This app only displayed the first 5 of the hundred flights it searched, so completely worthless. Crashes every other time. Like the website but this app is piece of junk.

Version 1.5.1 3
 (Kayak Flight Search) I use Kayak reguarly on-line. Just tried the new iPhone app, and it searched well with similar results and no crashing the first few searches. What enhancement I really need is to save or forward search results or individual flights to those who will book them. One more star when that is added.

Version 1.5.1 4
 (Great!!!) User frienly and fast. Get the best deal without having to visit many sites!

Version 1.5.1 3
 (Crashes) Consistent crashes when searching international flights.  (delete and reinstall doesnt  fix it.) Interface is very good, and it's quick.  Fix the crashes and it's a 5 star.

Version 1.5.1 5
 (Wonderful) Great app, works like a charm
Well worth your time

Version 1.5.1 4
 (Wow! ÓÄù) This app just saved me so much time. And as we all know, ÓÄ¶ = ÓÑØ.

Version 1.5 1
 (Needs more work) I tried to look for a hotel in NYC and it kept giving me NJ hotels. I tried different names, manhattan, NYC, etc and nothing worked!

Version 1.5.1 5
 (Great app) I use this for all my traveling needs

Version 1.5.1 5
 (Amazing) Amazing app, can roll out of bed and pick the cheapest airport to fly to for the day, week, or month!

Version 1.5.1 5
 (GREAT APP!!!) I found this app to be very useful and convenient. It's very user-friendly and does almost everything I wanted it to do. One thing missing from this app is the email to a friend option. It would be great if that was included....please add that option ÓÑÉ. Otherwise I'm very impressed!

Version 1.5.1 4
 (Informative) If i wanted to call reservation agents of airline and stay on hold untill god knows when, I would have downloaded the yellow pages... Good app for searching fares but cannot book thus the airlines or other sites simply dis-honor the kayak results and jack up the prices

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Crashtastic) Crashed constantly. Basic searches result in a crash. I deleted it from iTunes. What a shame.

Version 1.5.1 5
 (Very impressive) Remarkable how all the familiar kayak functions are squeezed so beautifully into this app. Well done.

Version 1.5.1 5
 (Great, Fast Search Engine Worked First Time) I'm always apprehensive when the one star ratings exceed the five stars. However, I've found that many crash reports are exaggerated, and often resolved with an iTouch/iPhone reset. In any case, nothing of the sort was required in my case. The app fired right up, and I'd comleted my first flight search (returned 484 choices) in less time than it usually takes to log into my PC based travel app. Before receiving SideStep's email, I'd never heard of Kayak.com. Now it will be my favorite travel website, in addition to this app being the only such app on my iTouch.

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Latest Version Crashes Constantly) Newest version just released does not work properly. Searches fine and finds flights, but when it finishes the search, it then does not display any results in the results screen, and then promptly crashes. It did this multiple times. I'm using an iPhone 3G with latest OS. This has a major bug.

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Crashfest) Once the crash big is fixed this app could be very useful. Not having to deal with travel sites online is the main advantage.

Version 1.5.1 5
 (Good app) Provides best prices I could find for hotel and flights. Verified using other travel sites.

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Crashes after Flight Search) why was this released without testing? crashes after a simple flight search ... every time!

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Previously good app) Update does not work at all

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Cash before take-off) Update does not work

Version 1.5.1 4
 (Very useful App) I use this almost every day to track fares. The interface could use some work to make it more user-friendly, but it gets the job done.

Version 1.5.1 5
 (Awsome) Very well designed app. I haven't had any reported problem such as crashing app.

Version 1.5.1 3
 (Good but crashes alot) Great concept but it crashes alot. I actually had to uninstall it and then reinstall it since it kept crashing. Also i think the "cheap," "soon" and whatever the third tab is named are not intuitive and a failed attempt to be cute. It has the potential to be great but not there yet.

Version 1.5.1 3
 (So much potential) I hadn't heard of Kayak.com til I saw this app. When I get it to work it's an amazing app. Does so much with a great search engine and helping you find the flight you want. 

Someone else said it before, they did a search and it showed close to 500 results and said no results found. 

It still crashes occasionally and I reset my iPhone once or twice daily to keep it running smoothly. After the update the crashes are less frequent, hopefully the developers fix these minor bugs because this is an amazing app.

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Useless) It searches for a flight.....starts to download a list of available ones and then shows "no flights available" and shuts itself off.

Version 1.5.1 4
 (S'aright) Kayak is much better than those other ones ( I'm lookin at you Shatner ). And yes it has crashed once or twice but I suspect all the people giving this app one star really just need to turn their phone off every now and then to free up memory. Personally I think the Internet is just as slow as the app too so no gripe there from me.

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Stick to ocean craft Kayak) This is useless. Period end of story.

Version 1.5.1 5
 (L.A. to China) This App is awsome! Very smart it looks up all major online ticket prices from orbits to virgin air. It's very fast and no crashes yet.. Really cool and easy to use interface. Plus the price trends graph is the first I every seen and really usefull.

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Such a shame!) I downloaded the app and did a search and it was showing several different options and prices while the search was progressing but once the search was completed the page said no results found. However, at the bottom of the screen it said showing 464 of 464 results. Too bad! This could be a really good app if it didn't have this bug.

Version 1.5.1 3
 (I agree) Great app but crashes too often. Work on this and the additional stars are yours!!

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Crashy McCrasherston) The name of my review says it all...Maybe the app should work before it's released...just a thought. Thank goodness it's free.

Version 1.5.1 3
 (Just one more thing.) Needs rental cars too.

Version 1.5.1 1
 (Crashing after simple flight search) All I did was open app and searched for flights BUR to BWI. Saw AA flights then United as search progressed. Once it reached the end of search, all results disappeared and said no flights found. Huh???  Waste of time.

Version 1.5 4
 (So far I'm impressed!) I have only had it for a short period of time, but the app is great for looking up and comparing airfare prices!

Version 1.5 3
 (Bitter Sweet) Great app, crashes often.  Please fix.

Version 1.5 5
 (Great app!!!) So much easier to use then the actual site if you are flexible and just want to catch a good deal!!! I wish there'd be one including cheaptix and cheapoair... Great job!!! For me it works really fast even on Edge network. Crashes rarely, not more often then any other app.

Version 1.5 1
 (Crashes continually.) Good concept and UI.  Poor execution...hopefully next version will be better.

Version 1.5 2
 (Crashes!) Crashes a lot.  You're better off going online.

Version 1.5 1
 (Crash and Crash) I love the Kayak Website, but this app is very slow and unresponsive and crashes continually. Avoid it.

Version 1.5 3
 (Crash city!) Nice app. Love the site, but this app crashes more than any other app I have.  How did this get through app store review?

Version 1.5 5
 (Should have waited to book!) I just booked a Christmas flight last week after comparing all the major travel sites but before downloading this app. I could have saved $30-$40 on airfare if I booked today using the Kayak app! It could just be timing and the dynamic nature of air travel, but this app showed cheaper options and seemed to work well.

Version 1.5 1
 (Crash) Crashes the second I get search results.  It is much easier to use the mobile site online.

Version 1.5 3
 (Hmmm...) Not a bad app, they just need to get the crash problem worked out and it's a winner.

Version 1.5 5
 (New fav. App. ) Thanks to this app I no longer have to be at my computer surfing continental flexible flights to get a good deal. Kayak is keeping me in the know.

Version 1.5 5
 (Awesome!) It never crash and works wonderfully every time for me (im 3gs user fyi)

Version 1.5 1
 (Crashh) Crashes alot! Better off just going online

Version 1.5 4
 (AWESOME) The best app I've downloaded so far. It's very useful. One suggestion though:  there shouldn't be a search limit. Other than that, the app is perfect, especially since it's free

Version 1.5 3
 (Wrong location ) Why is it when I search for hotels in New Orleans, LA, it returns with hotels in Greenburg, PA? A place where I have never been to nor searched for on this app or any app in my life?

Version 1.5 5
 (Found my flight!) Been looking every day for weeks to find a lower fare. Was out of the office and decided to check. And there it was. One single seat left. Thanks!

Version 1.5 5
 (Great app!!!!) I've used Kayak for years, and now to have this as an app, this is Great...if you travel (flights, hotels, car rental), you WANT this app. Thanks Kayak!!

Version 1.5 5
 (Kayak 1.5) well written application, great reference, puts most travel information at your fingertips, and it's free.

Version 1.5 5
 (Works Perfectly!ÓÄù) Amazing app that removes the multiple layers of work when trying to find the best fares.  Love the trend button that lets you see where the best fares are heading. 

Great iPhone user experience!

Get it now that the crashing bug has been fixed!

Version 1.5 5
 (Very handy) Love it

Version 1.5 5
 (Great app) I'm running it on a 3gs never crashed once like all these reviews. Come on step your game up and get a 3gs peeps!

Version 1.5 1
 (Not very stable...) App crashed 3 out of 4 searches...

Version 1.5 5
 (Excellent) Excellent I'd a paid a few dollars for it. Love it

Version 1.5 3
 (Frequent crashes are frustrating) Nice interface, but frequent crashes impair the app's utility.

Version 1.5 1
 (Crashes every time!) Would be a great app if it didn't crash...

Version 1.5 3
 (Good App. ) Once they fix, and update the crashing problem, this App. will be awesome.

Version 1.5 2
 (Crashes) Crashes all the time after every search. Needs an upgrade badly.

Version 1.5 1
 (Crash, iFare Finder much better) App crashes most of the time.  Filters don't respond to touch and the saved results don't refresh and saved data is incorrect.

Purchased iFare Finder to find flghts and that app works great. Well worth the price!  Don't waste the time on this one!

Version 1.5 1
 (If I could give no stars I would) Never worked. It crashes every time. C'mon guys.

Version 1.5 4
 (Great work) Great work!!! Please continue with more upgrade.

Version 1.5 2
 (Needs work) I love Kayak on the desktop but this app needs work. It crashes frequently and is missing the "flexible" dates option that makes the desktop version so powerful.

Version 1.5 3
 (Fun but crashy) Finding trends in pricing is very cool. Fix the crashing bugs and it is easily 4 stars

Version 1.5 5
 (Great app) Just luv it!!! With my line of work I could have used this a long time agoÓå∑Óå∑Óå∑cause the cartel i move stuff for is always changing dates and times, when they get worried that sombody is watching them they change my flight datesÓå∑Óå∑Óå∑Óå∑ÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄé

Version 1.5 5
 (Best free travel App) There is no other app that will match this. This is not as good fir features as their website: kayak.com or sidestep.com. But no application is. Good job though!

Version 1.5 4
 (Only missing one thing) Great app no issues at all. It's only missing one thing that I can see and that's the ability to search am or pm flight departures.

Version 1.5 2
 (Unstable with recent update...) With recent update very unstable & crashes!  I've uninstalled & reinstalled with no luck.

Version 1.5 4
 (Very goof on the go!!) It's not as developed and extended as the web-based service, but considering that we're on ver 1.5--it's pretty good and eventually will get there after a while. Kayak is one the greatest service online!!!

Version 1.4 3
 (Still needs work) The website is just awesome but this app is not there yet.  A lot of filtering options and text search options that make the web svc so powerful need to be added. Wanted to get a quote for hyatt in NYC and had to scroll through 700 options only to not find it. Pls keep working on these features

Version 1.4 3
 (Nice Application - But Missing Some Major Airlines) This is a nice application to have while travelling. The only drawback I have seen is that it does not show all airlines. Example, there are two airlines that fly into Valley International Airport in Harlingen, TX. This application only shows one and it's the smaller of the two. Beyond that, it is a good application when you're in a pinch for hotel or flight information - as long as you can live without "all the information". (iPhone 3G)

Version 1.4 3
 (Not Bad) Decent app. Would be great if you could look up multi-city flights instead of just round trips. Otherwise it's pretty cool.

Version 1.4 5
 (Very cool,) Used it to book a trip and plan another so far. Slick and easy for flights, haven't tried other features.

Version 1.4 4
 (Best travel purchase app out there!) Love the look up features and the options for looking for flights. I really like the fact that it shows trends as well for a particular destination. The one thing I didn't like that kept it from all five stars is how the flights are sorted and how combersome it is to go through EVERY flight combo for a destination. It should be sorted better.

Version 1.4 3
 (Pet Friendly Hotel Search) Although listings show whether pets are allowed it would be awesome if we could conduct a search for pet friendly hotels instead of having to click one by one. Needs more criteria search options. Please consider for future updates. Wag wag!

Version 1.4 5
 (Trends is must have feature) The Trends feature of this app shows you the average prices and low prices for a given route - showing you the cheapest time to go! This is the best feature and makes this a must have for me. This is easier to use than their web site...

Version 1.4 5
 (Get this app!) This app is awesome! Very helpful. Between my "Girl Trip" app (a must have app for all women!!!) and this one I'm all set! Thank u!

Version 1.4 3
 (Needs work ) Needs to have a function that will search for airports near the chosen airport

Version 1.4 5
 (Great free app!) Great free app that works as advertised. I've been looking for this type of app for long time. It does more than what I expected. And it is free!

Version 1.4 4
 (Great) Much bettter than travelocity. Works great!!!

Version 1.4 5
 (Great travel search app) This app is great for searching for flights. It's much easier than going on safari and using airline websites.

Version 1.4 5
 (Delivers what it's supposed to) If you regularly use Kayak, like I do it's great to show you which airline and itinerary you'd like to choose. Booking is on your own, but it never promised otherwise. Crashes seem fixed on OS 3.0

Version 1.4 3
 (Very helpful) Very helpful with finding information on flights and hotels. Better than taking the time to logging onto the computer.  It's great that it gives u prices of flights unlike the expedia or travelocity apps. GREAT!!

Version 1.4 5
 (Finally! This is great!) I've been waiting for this app for a while now. And it's even better than I expected! Sure, there's always room for improvement, but I travel a lot and this app makes finding my flight or hotel so quick and easy! Great job. Great app!

Version 1.3 4
 (Easier and Quicker than my MAC) Indeed sometimes this app will hang or crash... but mostly when its having trouble getting to the NET. However, it is so easy and quick to use that I can actually find stuff quicker than going to my MAC and using the WEB site. Coupled with the fact that Kayak is absolutely the best flight and hotel search engine and its hard to fault this app.

Version 1.4 1
 (=() Crashes everytime I try to open it.

Version 1.3 1
 (Not helpful) Brutal.   I tried to book a hotel in Vegas for the weekend.  Waited at least 3-5 minutes, and was finally redirected to a page that was unusable on Orbitz.

Version 1.3 4
 (whatever the issue was with the touch is fixed) downloaded this app months ago and it would never load on my iPod touch. then all the reviews said it crashed more than a commuter jet so I figured I wasn't missing anything. issues fixed now. working well. I like that when it takes u to off the 'site' and to the third parties like orbitz and cheaptickets it doesn't automatically open up their clunky websites but instead gives u am option to call and book right from your phone. smaaaht.

Version 1.3 4
 (Solid app) Does a nice job in searching for flights

Version 1.3 3
 (Great if you don't need multi-journey info) You can search one way and roundtrip but not multi-journey. Sadly that is mostly the type of trips I take so the app does not serve me much purpose while on the go.

Version 1.3 3
 (Much better than the previous version) It crashed all the time before the update. I used it to search flights to NYC and hotels in manhattan, and this time it worked smoothly. Little bit buggy but I think this is the only real app that allows you to search flights/hotels in one spot. I gave 1 star for the previous version but now I am much more satisfied with this.

Version 1.3 5
 (Best source for best travel prices) I love kayak - it's the best!

Version 1.3 5
 (A+) Good functionality, great results.

Version 1.3 4
 (No problems) I got no problems with this app, I have had no crashes or anything like that. Really don't remember if I paid for it an don't feel like going back and seeing If I did. It hasany uses especially for a traveler.

Version 1.3 4
 (Better than most paid apps.) Although the early versions were quite buggy and lacking in features, the latest version is very stable and has a great interface for finding flights. Cabin selection and filtering flights by alliance are still missing, so I can't give it 5 stars yet.  Otherwise, however, FANTASTIC tool... for free!

Version 1.3 5
 (Wow, amazing how many flights it finds) I would recommend this app to anybody who wants to save on air travel. It's amazing how many flights it finds. Bugs must be fixed, app did not crash on me ;-)

Version 1.3 5
 (Must have got the post-bug version.) Because, just downloaded it and it works AWESOME. Love this app, especially the trends section. Thanks!

Version 1.3 5
 (Much better than a paid app) Awesome app helped me a lot in searching for flights

Version 1.3 2
 (Crashed) Crashed!! It's a good application, but bugs need to be fixed.

Version 1.3 5
 (Great App!) Dropped me a couple of times but for the most part it works great!  ÓÅó

Version 1.3 3
 (Neat) Pretty cool app for free! Does crash frequently though. Would be really cool to have a place to enter ff# on airlines contact page for reference when calling. Looking forward to crash free flight searches!

Version 1.3 2
 (Eeh...) Crashed often and slow, but when it's functioning it is awesome.

Version 1.3 3
 (Needs multi city feature ) Needs multi city feature

Version 1.3 4
 (Doesn't work perfectly everytime..) ..but when it does, this app provides accurate, low-cost flight info, both international and domestic (U.S.) I've already used it to research my trip to the Ukraine in June and it found me a good flight for only $800 round-trip. Best I was able to find so far. Very good job folks. Beware of other, costlier apps that purport to find you cheaper fares but simply take you to Kayak!! Don't understand why this isn't a top-selling app...

Version 1.3 4
 (Does what I expected) This app has problems, but it does what I expected it to do.

Version 1.3 1
 (Crash crash crash) Crash

Version 1.3 1
 (BUGGY!) Come on guys.

Version 1.3 2
 (Great app but crashes a lot) Please fix all the crashes. Then it will be a great app.

Version 1.3 2
 (Very buggy) Very buggy

Version 1.3 5
 (Great app for airline tickets!) This has been a great app for me for searching for plane tickets. I don't know why other travel search engines don't have apps for the iPhone.

Version 1.1 5
 (Great) Great app

Version 1.1 1
 (Not worth the aggravation) Free, sure, but regularly claims there is no internet connection or crashes - even after re-installing,

Version 1.1 1
 (Great website...bad app) Does not connect to Internet, crashes frequently, and areas of the app just doesn't work. Don't waste your time until major upgrades are done.

Version 1.1 1
 (Very Disapointing) Love Kayak on the web but this app is useless. Constantly get the message "no internet connection", whether on Wifi or 3G, after waiting several seconds with no activity wondering what it is doing. This could/should be a great app. please fix it.

Version 1.1 1
 (Needs work) Doesn't connect to the Internet. Waste of time. Fix it!!!

Version 1.1 1
 (App Needs Improvement Badly!!!!) Conceptually it's an awesome app, however in reality it needs a lot of improvement at this point.  App is very buggy and freezes up a lot.

Version 1.3 3
 (Nice app...BUTT!) Only worked for about 10 mins. Keeps crashing, great app if it worked.

Version 1.1 5
 (Improved!) I revised my rating because the app hasn't crashed on me for awhile.  Now it is absolutely a five star app!!

Version 1.1 1
 (Doesn't connect anymore) This application doesn't connect anymore. It displays can't connect to the Internet no matter what every time. It was great when it worked but the application has been down for over a month now.

Version 1.1 1
 (Does not work after a few weeks) Worked well for a few weeks and then stopped working.  Could not even search for flights. When you tap on the Kayak app button nothing will open, tap again nothing happens, try again it opens, hit the flights button and the application stops.
When it did work for a few weeks it would not scroll properly and there was no option for nearby airports so you had to redo the flight search for the nearby airports.  
Do not know if you can even purchase anything since it never went that far into the booking process.
Have deleted the app but will reinstall since there may be an update but there have been no notices of updates.

Version 1.1 1
 (Uninstalled it) What a shame. Used it once and uninstalled it. Web version returned 100 results, iphone app searches and shows none...

Version 1.1 1
 (Promising but disappointing...) I so wanted to like this however it keeps crashing. The return date won't open, it won't recognize certain airports and it closes for no reason. Please fix this because I love the regular website!

Version 1.1 2
 (Wish it worked) Keeps crashing.

Version 1.1 5
 (Great app!) I am not sure why this app does not have a higher rating. It does exacty what it is supposed to. It finds you the cheapest airfares and let's you click off to the merchants site for purchase. I love it!

Version 1.1 1
 (Needs an upddate (desperately!!)) I typed in a popular airport and it came up with "no results!"

Version 1.1 5
 (They fixed the bug that says, "No connection") There was a bug. They fixed it. It now works like a charm. 

Uninstall your copy, reinstall it, and Bob's your uncle.

Version 1.1 1
 (Does not work!!!) I use Kayak on a regular basis, but only from my computer because the iPhone version does NOT work. Very disapointing!!!

Version 1.1 1
 (Great App if it worked right) Keeps telling me that I don't have a network connection. But alas, I do. I do!

Version 1.1 1
 (Use the website, not the app) Crashes alot, very unfortunate.

Version 1.1 2
 (Buggy) Great concept. Poor execution. Consistently crashes and fails to recognize wifi connection.

Version 1.1 5
 (Works fine) For those of you who reported crashing problem , make sure you restart your iphone often. I have used this app and works great so far.

Version 1.1 1
 (Frustating) Just when I thougth I had a way to search for flight on my Iphone I realized that this app does not work at all
It worked once and since then it keeps saying that there is no Internet connection. Isn't that something basic in iPhone apps?

Version 1.1 1
 (Not worth It, wait for next update) Works, at times then crashes the rest of the time. Great concept app not really that functional.

Version 1.1 1
 (Removed off my phone :() Love the concept but this app is not up to the Kayak name/website. Wish it was. Removed from my phone until they work out the significant kinks.

Version 1.1 1
 (Love it, but hate it) Kayak in general is fantastic, however this app leaves much to be desired. It crashes often and when it does "work" it regularly says that there are no flights found, when there are plenty. It could be great, but needs some tweaking.

Version 1.1 3
 (Nice way to compare airfares) I found this helpful in comparing airfares to find the best deal

Version 1.1 1
 (Ugggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh) It crashes it wont let me go back to change my retun date and even when it  didnt i couldnt tap on it!!!!!!!! Why oh why should i have wasted money on this??!!??!!??!!!???!!??!!??!!??!!¬°

Version 1.1 1
 (Terrible!) Always crashes. Useless. If it's fixed, also add muli-stop option.

Version 1.1 1
 (Crash problems) Crashes all the time. Better to just stick to the kayak mobile site.

Version 1.1 4
 (Works as promised) I have had no problems with Kayak. It is stable for me, even sorting. I would like options for first class.

Version 1.1 1
 (Unuseable- 0 stars) I use kayak.com all the time, but this application is basically unusuable. Way too many bugs, what a shame. I hope they fix it soon.

Version 1.1 1
 (No Internet conection?) Love Kayak on my Desktop, but hate it on iPhone. What's good an awesome search engine such as this if it keeps displaying "no internet conection available" when in fact there is? You had good intentions, but is not worth the effort.

Version 1.1 5
 (Brown Shady) I guess I am the minority, but it works great for me. I do agree there should be more options like business or first class.

Version 1.1 1
 (Poor programming) Unusable, crashes 9 times out of 10, needs much improvement.

Version 1.1 2
 (Fix the app) I made site I increased my memory using "free memory" before using this app. based on the reviews I read. I even sit down the phone. 

Fix the app. This should not have been released. The Brand Mamager at Kayak should be cringing as this does not bode well for the brand experience.

It crashed three times when itried to search for airports. Then it kept crashing once I found my flight and was tryi g to get more info. I actually need to book a flight and thought I'd try the app.

Oh well. Hate to say it, but it is no good. Completely unuseable on my 2nd 3G gen 16 gig iPhone.

Version 1.1 1
 (Yarg! Avoid at all costs!) Mayhaps this app was written with good faith, but seemingly it was by a blarmy tosspot! Praytell, why does thee app crash so idlely? I say to thee now: Fix thine app, and thou shalt be redeemed of thyself!

Version 1.1 2
 (Like Kayak, but app crashes) Crashes every single time I try to use the "filter flights" screen.  Love Kayak, but the app needs some love before I will reinstall it on my iPhone.

Version 1.1 4
 (It works!) A couple times of listed flights and when I selected one and the "no flights found" screen came up, so I searched again and it worked. Good app! Thanks!

Version 1.1 5
 (Great app!!) Quick and easy!! This is exactly what I've been looking for in a travel app

Version 1.1 1
 (Crashes) When it works, I love it, but it rarely works!  I finally deleted it because it was caught on a screen that I couldn't leave without a crash. I'm a software developer and can't imagine releasing such an embarassingly buggy app.

Version 1.1 1
 (Crashes!!!) Love Kayak but like everyone says, it just keeps crashing!

Version 1.1 1
 (App always crashes ) Can't keep the app stable enough to even complete one air search.  Even restarted my phone twice.  Why release such poor work?  Doesn't say much for the brand

Version 1.1 1
 (kayak 1st not so good) does not work.... yet maybe version two

Version 1.1 3
 (Love the Idea of the App, don't like how it doesn't work well...) I love kayak.com, unfortunately, the flight search doesn't work. Well, I think it works, but the rendering of listing the flights doesn't show up.

Version 1.1 1
 (Crashes alot) Love kayak.com but this app is horrible it crashes constantly! Your better off just going to kayak from safari then wasting time with this

Version 1.1 5
 (Kayakkity Saxxx) Great app

Works great, can't wait to see what else they come up with.

Version 1.1 5
 (The trend feature shows you when the cheapest flights are) Best travel prices app so far!

Version 1.1 4
 (Can't wait for the updates!) As a frequent road/air traveler I know this app will be superb when the frequent crashes and air search results are momentarily displayed and then hidden by message "No Results found". The hotel search appears to work well and I LOVE the filter! As I said before, the app will rock when the flights are fixed.

Version 1.1 3
 (Good one) Hi, nice app, but crashes frequently. Could be enhanced by eliminating frequent crashes. Thanks kayak.

Version 1.1 3
 (Need to filter by departure time) Big negative: no filter/search by departure time.

Version 1.1 1
 (Crashes all the time) Love kayak but this app needs a lot of work.

Version 1.0 4
 (Good App!) Fast working app. The site show amenaties of the hotels for quick reference. Would have given it 5 stars if the connection to safari links were active.

Version 1.0 5
 (I've been waiting!) And it finally came out. This is an amazing application and I use it all the time!

Highly reccomended.

Version 1.0 5
 (Excellent) Was waiting for either kayak or sidestep to release an app.  Has filter fields just like website does.

Version 1.0 4
 (Still needs some work) It's good for now. But it needs some updating. However it's the first try. I'll be looking for the update.

Version 1.0 5
 (Well done) Love integration of phone numbers to book.

Version 1.0 5
 (GREAT App.) Best App. ever for the everyday traveler.  Down loaded it yesterday booked a Hotel today.  I Love the fact that they search Hotels as well as Flights.  Keep up the go work!!

Version 1.0 5
 (Useful) I like that it connects me directly to airlines' sites and phone numbers.

Version 1.0 4
 (Great!) I love Kayak's website.  This is just the app I was looking for!  I only wish it had the flexible dates search (maybe I didn't see it).  I love it!

Version 1.1 5
 (Love this) I have used kayak for years awesome because it searches a lot of other sites for low fares

Version 1.0 5
 (Love it!) Very clean and easily usable. Exactly what I would expect from kayak. I imagine it will be very helpful when flights get cancelled.

Version 1.1 1
 (More features needed) A map function while viewing hotels needed.
Ability to filter by price range needed.
